Rajapaksas to regroup through new Lanka political alliance,09 September,"Sri Lanka's politically under siege Rajapaksa family would return to dominate once again by forming a new alliance, Namal Rajapaksa, the son of the former president and prime minister Mahinda Rajapaksa, said on Friday.""We will form a new political alliance under the leadership of Mahinda Rajapaksa,"" he told a political gathering of the ruling Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) in the southwestern province of the crisis-hit country.The SLPP has been at the receiving end of public anger when the island plunged deep into the current economic crisis, leading to street protests in late March, blaming the government for its incompetence.A continuous public protest which lasted over three months saw the ouster of Gotabaya Rajapaksa, the then president.Namal Rajapaksa said Gotabaya Rajapaksa's inability to crack down on the protests, which he claimed had turned violent, was the reason for the ousted President's downfall. The Rajapaksa family had dominated Sri Lanka's political scene for nearly two decades before all the brothers were forced to quit following unprecedented anti-government protests.Namal's father Mahinda resigned on May 9 when his supporters physically attacked the protest site, followed by bloody violence that left many dead. A backlash thereafter saw over 70 SLPP parliamentarians suffering arson attacks on their private properties throughout the country in addition to one of them being killed in a mob attack.The SLPP since May has suffered defections with nearly 50 of their coalition members quitting the party to form other alliances. The protest movement forced the fleeing of Gotabaya Rajapaksa from the country while Basil Rajapaksa, the former finance minister and Namal's uncle, was stopped at the airport early in July from leaving the country by the protest activists.However, Basil Rajapaksa departed to the US on Friday after the court allowed him to travel overseas, officials said.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/world/rajapaksas-to-regroup-through-new-lanka-political-alliance-9156661.html,Partnership,"""We will form a new political alliance under the leadership of Mahinda Rajapaksa,"" he told a political gathering of the ruling Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) in the southwestern province of the crisis-hit country.The SLPP has been at the receiving end of public anger when the island plunged deep into the current economic crisis, leading to street protests in late March, blaming the government for its incompetence.A continuous public protest which lasted over three months saw the ouster of Gotabaya Rajapaksa, the then president.Namal Rajapaksa said Gotabaya Rajapaksa's inability to crack down on the protests, which he claimed had turned violent, was the reason for the ousted President's downfall.The protest movement forced the fleeing of Gotabaya Rajapaksa from the country while Basil Rajapaksa, the former finance minister and Namal's uncle, was stopped at the airport early in July from leaving the country by the protest activists.However, Basil Rajapaksa departed to the US on Friday after the court allowed him to travel overseas, officials said.",['Namal'],[]

BJP hopes Modi chemistry will prevail over Cong-SP in Varanasi,06 March,"Varanasi is not turning out to be the cakewalk the BJP might have hoped for its Assembly candidates in Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Lok Sabha constituency.Factors like consolidation of opposition votes and well-entrenched rival candidates against BJP's perceived fumbling in picking its nominees have come together to make contests close in this high-profile seat.BJP President Amit Shah might have dismissed opposition's suggestions that multiple public events by Modi here besides deployment of a number of union ministers and top party leaders in campaigning is indicative of ""desperation"" in his ranks but it is clear that his party is going out of the way to ensure a good saffron show.""I am a little critical.

Prospects of SP-Congress alliance in rough weather,22 January,"Prospects of an alliance between Samajwadi Party and Congress for the upcoming Uttar Pradesh polls appeared to have run into rough weather, with both parties today hardening their stance over sharing of seats.Senior SP leader Naresh Agarwal said the possibility of an alliance was ""almost over"" and blamed the ""stubborn"" attitude of Congress for the deadlock.""The Chief Minister (Akhilesh Yadav) had made an offer of 100 seats to the Congress but they are asking for 120 seats. We told them that we have 234 sitting legislators and there are some others who will also contest.

BJP to discuss probability of parting ways with Sena today,15 October,"Amidst signs of growing fissures between the two allies in Maharashtra, the Bharatiya Janata Party-led state government on Thursday will discuss the ""probability of snapping ties"" with the Shiv Sena after it asked BJP to opt out of coalition government if they have any problems with their ally.The ""probability of snapping ties"" with the Shiv Sena would be discussed in a joint meeting of BJP ministers and party functionaries on Thursday, a top BJP leader has said.According to the party functionary, BJP wants the Shiv Sena to ""quit"" from power. On the contrary another senior BJP leader has said that Sena would not ""dare"" to take the extreme decision.Meanwhile, a Shiv Sena leader here termed the idea of quitting as ""rumours"" and said it will continue to be in power.The official agenda of the meet is the Devendra Fadnavis government's one year in power, its achievements and ways of celebrating it.""Five major achievements from each portfolio will also be finalised in the meeting. There are other issues to be discussed as well,"" BJP spokesperson Madhav Bhandari said, even as he denied any discussion on the Uddhav Thackeray-led party in Thursday's meeting.Another party leader who will be part of the October 15 meeting, claimed that the BJP feels ""suffocated"" with the Sena's behaviour towards it.""Though Sena is a part of the BJP government, both at Centre and in the state, it has not wasted even a single opportunity to criticise Prime Minister Narendra Modi, party president Amit Shah and the BJP,"" the leader said, requesting anonymity.He further claimed that in the last few days, Sena has tried to ""blackmail"" the state government over Pakistan singer Ghulam Ali and former Foreign Minister of Pakistan Khurshid Kasuri (over their engagements in the city).According to the leader, there is a ""strong mindset"" against the Sena within the ruling party.In a closed-door discussion between BJP leaders and ministers held recently, ""parting ways"" with Sena was deliberated for the sake of development of the state, he said.""We have 123 legislators, 7 independents are with BJP, we will need 15 more legislators to prove our majority if Sena quits from the government,"" he said.""Once the Sena quits, at least 17 to 18 Sena legislators will join BJP,"" he added.However, senior leader and state Education Minister Vinod Tawde has rejected the possibility of Sena quitting power, and asserted that the coalition government will complete its five-year tenure.""Nobody wants to contest elections once again before completing their tenure.

Why Shiv Sena wants to end alliance with BJP in Maha?,13 October,"Will they? Won’t they? People of Maharashtra are asking these two questions. Some feel that the alliance between BJP and Shiv Sena is over, the only thing left is official break-up. But a section is of the view that Shiv Sena won’t rock the boat now.The oldest electoral alliance in India had come to an end in 2014 a month before the Maharashtra Assembly elections. After the BJP failed to get a clear majority in the Assembly, the ‘wounded’ Shiv Sena led by Uddhav Thackeray reluctantly re-united with the BJP extending support to the Devendra Fadnavis-led government.The BJP also ‘reluctantly’ accepted the support and offered Shiv Sena MLAs minor portfolios in Maharashtra Cabinet. But the BJP-Shiv Sena relationship have been strained beyond repair in the last one year. Shiv Sena has been openly attacking the BJP on various issues.The Shiv Sena has always been unconformable with the idea of Narendra Modi leading the BJP. It had attacked him before the Lok Sabha elections and had even questioned his leadership capabilities.They unwillingly fought the 2014 Lok Sabha elections together. After Modi became the Prime Minister, he treated Shiv Sena with some kind of ‘contempt’. It was also offered just one Cabinet berth at the Centre. There have been talks of Shiv Sena pulling out of the Modi government for the past one year.Fight for SupremacyThe BJP and Shiv Sena fight has more to do with fight for supremacy and egos. Shiv Sena does not want to BJP to lead the alliance partner. It believes that Maharashtra is Sena’s fiefdom and the BJP should follow Sena. Sena founder Bal Thackeray had an excellent rapport with the BJP stalwarts Aatal Bihari Vajpayee and Lal Krishna Advani. They had mutual respect and admiration.The BJP point-person late Pramod Mahajan, who actually forged alliance with the Sena also had an excellent relationship Bal Thackeray and other Sena cadres. After his death, Mahajan's brother-in-law and BJP's face in Maharashtra the late Gopinath Munde handled the relationship. Since both Mahajan and Munde met with an untimely death, the BJP is left with nobody of that stature to deal with the Sena.Though both BJP and Shiv Sena practice the same ‘nationalism’, Shiv Sena’s ‘nationalism’ is more local and embarrasses the BJP at times. Sena is also worried about the possibility of BJP growing in its strongholds in the state. The Sena cadre is also getting increasingly impatient. Uddhav knows that staying with the BJP and swallowing insults will ruin his party in the long run. He has been waiting for an opportunity to pull out and go down as a martyr.What next?If the Shiv Sena walks out of the alliance, Devendra Fadnavis government in Maharashtra will be in trouble. It won't collapse overnight because the NCP-led Sharad Pawar may back the government.It is a well known fact that Pawar shares a great rapport with local BJP leaders including Fadnavis. Sena thinks that sitting in the opposition for the next four years would be more beneficial to the party rather than continuing with the alliance with no say in the matters of the state.BJP-Shiv Sena points of tussle- Sena peeved after its representative in Modi cabinet, Anant Geete wasn't given a meaty portfolio.- Differences over seat sharing before 2014 Assembly elections resulted in both sides contesting independently- Sena forced to forgo demand for Deputy CM and Home Ministry.- Sena at the 11th hour pulled back its nominee for Modi's Cabinet expansion MP Anil Desai after he was offered MoS post- Senior Sena leader Suresh Prabhu quit party to join BJP and was made a Union Cabinet Minister- After BJP's drubbing in Delhi polls, Uddhav claimed it was a defeat for Modi and waning of Modi wave- Sena's mouthpiece Saamana constantly takes potshots at BJP leadership at state and Centre- Sena opposed the state government's meat ban calling it an attack on Marathi eating habits- Despite Fadnavis' assurance of security for Ghulam Ali concert, it was called off after Sena's open threat- Fadnavis accused Sena of turning the state into banana republic after the latter threatened the launch of Kasuri's book",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/politics/why-shiv-sena-wants-to-end-alliancebjpmaha-1319891.html,Partnership,"After the BJP failed to get a clear majority in the Assembly, the ‘wounded’ Shiv Sena led by Uddhav Thackeray reluctantly re-united with the BJP extending support to the Devendra Fadnavis-led government.The BJP also ‘reluctantly’ accepted the support and offered Shiv Sena MLAs minor portfolios in Maharashtra Cabinet.Sena thinks that sitting in the opposition for the next four years would be more beneficial to the party rather than continuing with the alliance with no say in the matters of the state.BJP-Shiv Sena points of tussle- Sena peeved after its representative in Modi cabinet, Anant Geete wasn't given a meaty portfolio.- Differences over seat sharing before 2014 Assembly elections resulted in both sides contesting independently- Sena forced to forgo demand for Deputy CM and Home Ministry.- Sena at the 11th hour pulled back its nominee for Modi's Cabinet expansion MP Anil Desai after he was offered MoS post- Senior Sena leader Suresh Prabhu quit party to join BJP and was made a Union Cabinet Minister- After BJP's drubbing in Delhi polls, Uddhav claimed it was a defeat for Modi and waning of Modi wave- Sena's mouthpiece Saamana constantly takes potshots at BJP leadership at state and Centre- Sena opposed the state government's meat ban calling it an attack on Marathi eating habits- Despite Fadnavis' assurance of security for Ghulam Ali concert, it was called off after Sena's open threat- Fadnavis accused Sena of turning the state into banana republic after the latter threatened the launch of Kasuri's book","['BJP', 'Assembly', 'Uddhav Thackeray', 'BJP', 'the Devendra Fadnavis-led', 'BJP', 'Maharashtra Cabinet', 'BJP', 'Anant Geete', 'Assembly', 'CM', 'MoS', 'BJP', 'Union Cabinet', 'BJP', 'BJP', 'Marathi', 'Fadnavis accused Sena']",[]
Grand 'secular alliance' with Left in Bihar unlikely,14 June,"Efforts to form a grand 'secular' alliance against BJP in Bihar Assembly elections have suffered a setback with the Left parties reluctant to join such a formation and likely to fight as a separate bloc.JD(U) sources said their proposal to the Left parties had so far not elicited any positive response and they have indicated that they would be going to the hustings as a separate formation.Though the two major Left parties -- CPI and CPI(M) -- have weakened in Bihar over the years, the former continues to have some pockets of influence in the state where it was once the main opposition party. The CPI (ML) is currently the strongest of the Left parties, having support in parts of central Bihar and naxal- affected pockets of the state.CPI(ML) Politburo member Prabhat Chaudhary said his party was unlikely to fight alongside JD(U)-RJD-Congress combine and was working for an alliance among the Left parties.""We have been against the state government's policies and also those of Congress at the Centre.

Small banks pad up with cricket partnerships to build brands and add customers,28 March,"Cricket is becoming a magnet for banks, drawing them in to explore sponsorship and partnership deals and expand their brand reach, as well as acquire new customers.Small Finance Banks (SFB) Equitas, AU, Ujjivan and Fino Payments Bank recently partnered with teams from the Indian Premier League (IPL) and sponsored cricket events. These banks are looking for brand expansion and seeking to widen their customer base through these deals.AU Small Finance Bank and Ujjivan Small Finance Bank were among the prime sponsors during the latest India vs New Zealand Men’s Test and One-day international series. The banks had their billboards on the boundary line and on different stands in the stadium.Equitas Small Finance Bank and Fino Payments Bank, on the other hand, have partnered with teams from the popular Indian Premier League (IPL) T-20 cricket format. Equitas SFB has partnered Royal Challengers Bangalore and Gujarat Titans, while Fino Payments Bank has partnered with Rajasthan Royals.Cricket tournaments, these banks believe, provide a huge opportunity to engage with wider audiences, reach a new geographical customer base, and boost brand awareness.Anand Bhatia, Chief Marketing Officer (CMO), Fino Payments Bank, said that the bank would continue to ride on sports to drive business. “We wish to continue to invest in sports, largely cricket, primarily because this sport has the potential to attract customers who would be interested in digital banking services,” Bhatia said.Speaking to Moneycontrol, Murali Vaidyanathan, Senior President and Country Head, Branch Banking, Liabilities, Products and Wealth, Equitas Small Finance Bank, said that tie-ups with IPL teams would give the bank exposure to new audiences and demographics.Ujjivan Small Finance Bank refused to comment for this story. AU Small Finance Bank did not respond till the time of publishing it.Cricket, IPL partnerships and beyondBanks have always been interested in associating with cricket tournaments. Additionally, some banks also have some cricketers as their ambassadors.Take the example of Equitas SFB. The lender has had Smriti Mandhana, an Indian women’s team player, as its brand ambassador from 2021. Other than Equitas SFB, private sector lender Bandhan Bank, in January 2023, launched a marketing campaign with Sourav Ganguly, former captain of the men’s cricket team.Also read: Women's IPL: A new playground for brands looking to ride on another cricket propertyIn terms of partnerships with IPL teams, previously, banks such as HSBC Bank, ICICI Bank and Yes Bank had partnered with teams to launch co-branded credit and debit cards, provide various bank account services, etc. Equitas SFB and Fino Payments Bank had earlier partnered with different IPL teams to launch co-branded products and promote digital banking.Other than banks, non-banking financial companies (NBFC) and fintechs have also struck deals and some have even been major sponsors of the tournament.For instance, Paytm and PhonePe have had major sponsorship deals with the IPL in the past.NBFCs such as Muthoot Fincorp partnered with Bengaluru-based Royal Challengers Bangalore while fintechs Slice, AmazonPay, Rapi Pay, One Finance, Ebix Cash, etc. have partnerships with several teams.But why the IPL?According to a report by Broadcast Audience Research Council (BARC), a television measurement science industry body, the 2016 edition of the IPL contributed to 22 percent of total sports viewership. But in 2018, this number jumped to 43 percent. Experts said that this number is set to rise.Also read: IPL 2023 to see higher ad revenue riding on digital; audience reach to be on par with TVOther than the large viewership of the tournament, bankers say it gives them a new and wider audience base. “The IPL provides us a new, digital-oriented, diverse set of people with its domestic as well as international audiences, which could work as a great tool for us,” Bhatia said.Vaidyanathan added: “Partnerships with cricket teams are a long-term goal as they (the small banks) see the potential of growth through the tie-ups.”Experts believe that SFBs are targeting these tournaments to work on their brand awareness as their physical reach (in terms of branches) is not that high as other banks.“Earlier, SFBs attracted people with favourable interest rates. But now, they are at par with major banks and hence, for them to promote their services and attract audiences to avail of their services, they are partnering with different teams and sponsoring cricket tournaments,” said Jindal Haria, Associate Director, India Ratings and Research.Greater visibilityOther than geographical reach, experts highlighted that creating awareness is another aspect for SFBs as competition from other banks, NBFCs and fintechs is becoming more intense.“Awareness and getting visibility is a major thing that SFBs need to work on. With these partnerships, one can see SFBs getting maximum attention,” said Archana Fulwari, Assistant Professor, Maharaj Sayajirao University.Aditya Shah, a financial and banking expert, cited brand awareness as the reason for SFBs to partner with IPL teams. “The race for deposits is very tough among banks. And in the case of SFBs, these partnerships work out very well for them as they get lots of eyeballs, especially millennials, who want quick, digital banking services. SFBs, compared to other big banks, have better digital offerings and hence, can convert these to potential customers,” Shah said.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/small-banks-pad-up-with-cricket-partnerships-to-build-brands-and-add-customers-10324241.html,Partnership,"“The IPL provides us a new, digital-oriented, diverse set of people with its domestic as well as international audiences, which could work as a great tool for us,” Bhatia said.Vaidyanathan added: “Partnerships with cricket teams are a long-term goal as they (the small banks) see the potential of growth through the tie-ups.”Experts believe that SFBs are targeting these tournaments to work on their brand awareness as their physical reach (in terms of branches) is not that high as other banks.“Earlier, SFBs attracted people with favourable interest rates.But now, they are at par with major banks and hence, for them to promote their services and attract audiences to avail of their services, they are partnering with different teams and sponsoring cricket tournaments,” said Jindal Haria, Associate Director, India Ratings and Research.Greater visibilityOther than geographical reach, experts highlighted that creating awareness is another aspect for SFBs as competition from other banks, NBFCs and fintechs is becoming more intense.“Awareness and getting visibility is a major thing that SFBs need to work on.","['IPL', 'India Ratings and Research']",[]
Air India takes off to biggest deal in commercial aviation history with Airbus & Boeing,11 February,"Air India Ltd. has signed agreements with Airbus SE and Boeing Co for what could become the largest purchase of jetliners in commercial aviation history, as the carrier seeks to reinvent itself with a fuel-efficient fleet that can take on local low-cost rivals and powerful Gulf airlines like Emirates.The airline has agreed on the outlines of the accord with the two plane-makers and may formally announce the deal as early as next week, according to people familiar with the talks, who asked not to be identified because the negotiations are confidential.Airbus stands to win about 250 orders and commitments in total, made up of 210 of the A320 single-aisle family models and 40 A350s wide-bodies, the people said. Boeing has secured about 290 possible purchases, with 190 737 Max aircraft and the option for 50 more, as well as 20 787 Dreamliners and the same number as a possible top-up, alongside 10 777x aircraft, the people said.The final tally could still change because of the complicated structure of the deal, which is made up of firm orders, memorandums of understanding and letters of intent, both of which are less firm than an outright purchase accord, the people said.Officials for Airbus, Boeing and Air India declined to comment.Air India and its parent, Tata Group, spent months negotiating the massive transaction, which should allow the carrier to upgrade service and reliability while lowering fuel costs. It’s also an attempt for the storied airline, founded under Tata in the 1930s, to win back traffic from Gulf rivals such as Emirates or Qatar Airways, which have built a business model ferrying Indians to the US and Europe via their huge hubs in Dubai and Doha.Also Read: Boeing loses $663 million in Q4 despite higher revenueChina UpswingCarriers around the world have been upgrading and refreshing their fleets to cash in on the rapid rebound in travel after the Covid pandemic. Locking in fresh aircraft commitments had become a matter of urgency for Air India as the supply of newly built jetliners became increasingly constrained.After China abruptly ended many of its harsh coronavirus measures in December and last month threw open its international borders, the travel upswing has only gathered pace. Airlines are ramping up their long-haul capacity, enticed by the prospect of the world’s biggest outbound tourism market being open for business again and betting that demand more broadly will return to pre-pandemic levels in 2023.Tata bought Air India last year in the most high-profile privatization under Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The transaction ended decades of attempts to offload the money-losing, debt-laden carrier that survived on years of taxpayer bailouts.Also Read: Air India finalises deal with Airbus for buying around 250 planesMarket ConsolidationAs part of the purchase, the group is consolidating its aviation business, which includes four airline brands. Tata said last year it would merge Air India with Vistara, which it jointly holds with Singapore Airlines Ltd. That agreement will give Singapore Air a 25.1 percent stake in the combined carrier.The deal is also a big win for Airbus and Boeing, both of which have local ventures with the Tata Group, India’s largest conglomerate. The manufacturers have benefited from the rise of budget carriers in India that have placed mega orders in past years. In 2019, Airbus landed one of its biggest-ever deals with the sale of 300 narrowbody planes to Indian budget carrier IndiGo, worth more than $33 billion at sticker prices.While Air India’s latest order further cements Airbus’s lead in narrowbody aircraft, it also gives the European manufacturer an important win in the widebody space that’s historically been the domain of Boeing.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/air-india-signs-pacts-with-airbus-and-boeing-in-biggest-deal-in-commercial-aviation-history-10054781.html,Partnership,"Air India Ltd. has signed agreements with Airbus SE and Boeing Co for what could become the largest purchase of jetliners in commercial aviation history, as the carrier seeks to reinvent itself with a fuel-efficient fleet that can take on local low-cost rivals and powerful Gulf airlines like Emirates.The airline has agreed on the outlines of the accord with the two plane-makers and may formally announce the deal as early as next week, according to people familiar with the talks, who asked not to be identified because the negotiations are confidential.Airbus stands to win about 250 orders and commitments in total, made up of 210 of the A320 single-aisle family models and 40 A350s wide-bodies, the people said.Boeing has secured about 290 possible purchases, with 190 737 Max aircraft and the option for 50 more, as well as 20 787 Dreamliners and the same number as a possible top-up, alongside 10 777x aircraft, the people said.The final tally could still change because of the complicated structure of the deal, which is made up of firm orders, memorandums of understanding and letters of intent, both of which are less firm than an outright purchase accord, the people said.Officials for Airbus, Boeing and Air India declined to comment.Air India and its parent, Tata Group, spent months negotiating the massive transaction, which should allow the carrier to upgrade service and reliability while lowering fuel costs.","['Air India Ltd.', 'Airbus', 'Boeing Co', 'Airbus', 'Boeing', 'Airbus', 'Boeing', 'Air India', 'Air India', 'Tata Group']","['$663 million', 'more than $33 billion']"

But did you know physiologically, the heightened bodily responses of instant attraction are actually a fight or flight response? A state of arousal when your body evaluates whether you are in danger. This instinct to team up, whether in love or business, is therefore agreeing to trust but also gauging the dangers in the partnership. You are both on guard and committing to trust each other. That’s why new partnerships are a bit of a game. You’re reading each other and figuring out how much to trust and how soon to run.Social equity theory, an organisational principle in work places, may sound dry, but the ratio of input to output does define the rationality of workable relationships. Partners who feel they are getting a fair deal tend to work better together. So they examine whether they or their partner is getting a better deal. People tend to compare the deal they have with what another person gets, a standard, say a friend. They go ‘hey, why are they getting a Diwali bonus or expensive gift when I’m not?’ The value of equity is always based on perception, whether it markets or in relationships. But what is perception based on?One of my teachers of Buddhist philosophy tells the following story: Two people head out for a driving test early in the morning. One of them is sleepy so the instructor insists she drinks coffee before beginning. The other is too nervous, so the instructor insists she closes her eyes and takes some calming breaths before beginning. When the students compare notes, they discover that one seems to have received something extra, preferential treatment, over the other, from each other’s perspective. These instructions or extras can get ritualised. The first student can begin to think they will not pass without drinking coffee. The second student can think that the breathing is the secret to passing the test. A third student who is prescribed neither of these can think that the instructor is showing favouritism to her other two students by undertaking special practices with them. The problem is not the practice per se, but the ritualisation of practice and not understanding why one is doing what one is doing.This applies to relationships of all kinds. We fall into routines, where even if we are performing the expected gesture, it has become meaningless and ritualised. If the ritual is missing, we imagine there is no value to the relationship anymore. We don’t understand what we do or why we do them, but believe doing them is what will make the relationship work, or a success.In a season of mass gifting, meaningless tokenism and commercialised value, it’s easy to mistake everything that is great for boosting the economy as good for relationships too. But that’s not always the case. It might be a good idea to stop and think what this token, gesture, gift, or ritual means this time. If it’s in a workplace, would you rather have a conversation with your boss about the next leadership role he sees you in, or a potential raise, or your flexi timing schedule, in lieu of the Tupperware gift set? If you have taken a business hit, or had to bear a lot of medical expenses this time, would it bring you closer as a family to sit down and talk about how you would rather save and invest than spend because you are expected to? Can you send out a gift that is home-made, sustainable and meaningful with a lovely note on the value of conservation at this time? Perhaps you will come away with an insight into who has understood the difficult lessons and values that you have had to cope with in this life-changing year or two.Relationships become equal not when they are mathematical, but when they are meaningful. An expensive gesture can be empty if it doesn’t come with time and thoughtfulness. At the same time, you can’t tell someone you’re gifting them your time when you are gifting everyone else your money! Balance goes both ways, and it shows.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/trends/health-trends/healing-space-the-secret-to-a-50-50-in-relationships-7617521.html,Partnership,"We don’t understand what we do or why we do them, but believe doing them is what will make the relationship work, or a success.In a season of mass gifting, meaningless tokenism and commercialised value, it’s easy to mistake everything that is great for boosting the economy as good for relationships too.If you have taken a business hit, or had to bear a lot of medical expenses this time, would it bring you closer as a family to sit down and talk about how you would rather save and invest than spend because you are expected to?",[],[]

Stamp duty laws for M&A â€“ an overhaul required,09 December,"Falguni Shah and Jayesh SanghviM&A in corporate India has played a major role in giving a boost to the economy. To achieve various commercial objectives, the companies undertake corporate restructuring and consolidation in the form of merger, demerger, slump sale, asset sale, share purchase, etc. In such a scenario, along with the tax and regulatory aspects, stamp duty implications merit equal importance Stamp duty is a tax levied on an ‘instrument’ that transfers, limits, extends, extinguishes, or records any right or liability. Hence, the stamp duty is leviable on a transaction only if there is an instrument through which such a transaction is executed. Stamp duty is a levy imposed by both the centre and state. The centre has express rights to tax certain instruments viz. instrument for transfer of shares, bills of exchange, etc.; with the objective of uniformity in rates across India. The power to prescribe rates of stamp duty on other instruments, and reduce or remit duty on such instruments rests with the state governments.  Each state has different rates of stamp duty for conveyance of movable and immovable properties. In a few states, there is a surcharge on stamp duty and also a separate percentage-based registration fees. For M&A and corporate restructuring especially involving Schemes of Arrangement (‘Scheme’) approved by the Court under provisions of the Companies Act, there are diverse provisions of stamp duty across different states. For the longest time, the most disconcerting question was whether the court order approving a scheme is an instrument that needs to be stamped. The issue was put to rest by the Supreme Court in the case of Hindustan Lever1  and allied judgements, which categorically expounded that the order of the High Court was an ‘instrument’ and therefore liable to stamp duty. Thereafter, many states have amended their legislation to include the entry of stamp duty (under the article of ‘conveyance’) on a Scheme. There was perplexity on whether duty is payable or not in a particular state not having specific entry for stamp duty on a Scheme. In the case of Delhi Towers Ltd, the Court held that though there is no specific entry for the Scheme, the court order approving the Scheme is a subject matter of adjudication under the entry of conveyance and hence transfer of property is liable to stamp duty in Delhi. Notwithstanding the contradictory rulings, authorities have been following the practice of charging stamp duty under the conveyance article in absence of specific entry for Schemes. Recently, Goa and West Bengal2  have introduced levy of stamp duty on court orders evidencing transfer of property. There is a vast difference in the rate of stamp duty on court order, distinguishing class of assets covered in the stamp duty net and variation in concession available. In Gujarat, the stamp duty on a court order approving a Scheme is 1% of value of immovable properties or 1% on higher of market value (for listed company) or face value (for unlisted company) of shares issued pursuant to the Scheme, whichever is higher. In Maharashtra, the stamp duty is 5% on value of immovable properties or 0.7% on value of shares issued pursuant to the Scheme, whichever is higher, subject to a maximum of 10% on the value of shares issued. In Goa, stamp duty is payable on both movable and immovable properties on the basis of rate applicable to conveyance being 7% (plus surcharge of 1%) on immovable properties and 6% on movable properties. However, if the paid up share capital of the transferee company is less than Rs. 5 crores and the directors of the entities involved in the scheme are common, then there is a remission of 80%. Karnataka levies 2% stamp duty on market value of all properties or 1% on value of shares issued and cancelled pursuant to the Scheme, whichever is higher.To alleviate some of the burden of stamp duty cost from the companies on account of the corporate restructuring, few states viz. Maharashtra, Gujarat and Rajasthan have presently provided a ceiling of Rs. 25 crores while in other states viz. Karnataka and Rajasthan, stamp duty is also payable on cancellation of shares in case of inter-company holding.Notification No. 1 of 1937 was issued to provide relief from stamp duty for companies undertaking internal restructuring (corporate arrangements between subsidiary and holding company where the holding company holds 90% or more in the subsidiary); however certain states such as Delhi expressly withdrew the notification while some other states are not providing this exemption. Recently, confusion has arisen on whether a set off of stamp duty payable in one state can be claimed in the other state in case two states are involved in a Scheme due to orders of two courts or the situs of properties in a state different from the state in which the court order is passed. The recent judicial ruling of the Bombay High Court in the case of Reliance Industries Limited and Reliance Petroleum Limited3 has highlighted this confusion. Hon’ble High Court, on its interpretation of the provisions of the Bombay Stamp Act, denied the benefit of rebate of stamp duty already paid on Gujarat order against the stamp duty to be paid in Mumbai. The High Court concluded that the orders passed by different courts are separate instruments that need to be stamped separately. This would result in double whammy for companies since the orders essentially provide the same transaction involving transfer of the same assets and liabilities through separate applications filed in different courts in different states. In case of conversion of a partnership firm into a company, the view prevailing is that there should not be any stamp duty in view of the decision of Hon’ble Andhra Pradesh High Court4. The reason is that there shall be statutory vesting of title of all the property of the firm into the company on change of the constitution of the partnership firm into a company under Part IX of the Companies Act without any need for a separate conveyance. Contradicting such a view, recently, Rajasthan has amended its Stamp Act to include a duty of 2% on the market value of immovable property vested in an LLP on conversion of a private / public unlisted company into an LLP.Stamp duty results in an immediate outflow of funds in any M&A activity, whereas the benefits are derived gradually. All the above factors have made corporate restructuring and consolidation an expensive affair for companies. For example, prior to doing an Initial Public Offer, consolidation of various operating entities / businesses within the group would be necessary. Similarly, in case of fund raising for a particular segment in a company, segregation of business would be necessary. Such transactions can be consummated by way of a Scheme. Under the Income Tax Act and other Indirect Taxes Laws, there are exemptions to such kinds of restructuring to make them a tax neutral exercise. However, the factors discussed above have cumulatively posed serious issues for such activities. For giving a boost to M&A activities, the rate of the stamp duty should be reduced manifestly to make them commercially feasible for all the stakeholders. What needs to be evaluated is the whether the benefits outweigh the cumbersome nature of compliances to be followed in order for companies to achieve synergies.Views expressed are personal.

The ability to drive traffic to their specific page using a short and memorable URL, presents SMBs with the ability to offer promotions and better target its customers with their own website address via a link as the ‘call-to-action’.“As India’s first and largest managed marketplace, our focus is to enhance our merchants’ visibility on the Internet and facilitate their growth. Our partnership with GoDaddy will help empower our seller base of over 400,000 merchants, in building a unique brand image while still enjoying the benefits of being enlisted on our platform that gives them support, credibility and access to millions of customers across the country. The synergistic partnership will further help our customers discover and purchase products from their favorite sellers with ease”, said Sanjay Sethi, Co-founder and CEO of Shopclues.""With internet penetration at an all-time high in India, more small businesses are coming online to tap the huge ecommerce opportunity,"" said Rajiv Sodhi, Vice President and Managing Director, GoDaddy India and Australia.

You can connect your domain name to an online marketplace and consolidate your online presence with your unique online address.”To register for a new domain name, customers can visit Domains on GoDaddy.

Why Shiv Sena wants to end alliance with BJP in Maha?,13 October,"Will they? Won’t they? People of Maharashtra are asking these two questions. Some feel that the alliance between BJP and Shiv Sena is over, the only thing left is official break-up. But a section is of the view that Shiv Sena won’t rock the boat now.The oldest electoral alliance in India had come to an end in 2014 a month before the Maharashtra Assembly elections. After the BJP failed to get a clear majority in the Assembly, the ‘wounded’ Shiv Sena led by Uddhav Thackeray reluctantly re-united with the BJP extending support to the Devendra Fadnavis-led government.The BJP also ‘reluctantly’ accepted the support and offered Shiv Sena MLAs minor portfolios in Maharashtra Cabinet. But the BJP-Shiv Sena relationship have been strained beyond repair in the last one year. Shiv Sena has been openly attacking the BJP on various issues.The Shiv Sena has always been unconformable with the idea of Narendra Modi leading the BJP. It had attacked him before the Lok Sabha elections and had even questioned his leadership capabilities.They unwillingly fought the 2014 Lok Sabha elections together. After Modi became the Prime Minister, he treated Shiv Sena with some kind of ‘contempt’. It was also offered just one Cabinet berth at the Centre. There have been talks of Shiv Sena pulling out of the Modi government for the past one year.Fight for SupremacyThe BJP and Shiv Sena fight has more to do with fight for supremacy and egos. Shiv Sena does not want to BJP to lead the alliance partner. It believes that Maharashtra is Sena’s fiefdom and the BJP should follow Sena. Sena founder Bal Thackeray had an excellent rapport with the BJP stalwarts Aatal Bihari Vajpayee and Lal Krishna Advani. They had mutual respect and admiration.The BJP point-person late Pramod Mahajan, who actually forged alliance with the Sena also had an excellent relationship Bal Thackeray and other Sena cadres. After his death, Mahajan's brother-in-law and BJP's face in Maharashtra the late Gopinath Munde handled the relationship. Since both Mahajan and Munde met with an untimely death, the BJP is left with nobody of that stature to deal with the Sena.Though both BJP and Shiv Sena practice the same ‘nationalism’, Shiv Sena’s ‘nationalism’ is more local and embarrasses the BJP at times. Sena is also worried about the possibility of BJP growing in its strongholds in the state. The Sena cadre is also getting increasingly impatient. Uddhav knows that staying with the BJP and swallowing insults will ruin his party in the long run. He has been waiting for an opportunity to pull out and go down as a martyr.What next?If the Shiv Sena walks out of the alliance, Devendra Fadnavis government in Maharashtra will be in trouble. It won't collapse overnight because the NCP-led Sharad Pawar may back the government.It is a well known fact that Pawar shares a great rapport with local BJP leaders including Fadnavis. Sena thinks that sitting in the opposition for the next four years would be more beneficial to the party rather than continuing with the alliance with no say in the matters of the state.BJP-Shiv Sena points of tussle- Sena peeved after its representative in Modi cabinet, Anant Geete wasn't given a meaty portfolio.- Differences over seat sharing before 2014 Assembly elections resulted in both sides contesting independently- Sena forced to forgo demand for Deputy CM and Home Ministry.- Sena at the 11th hour pulled back its nominee for Modi's Cabinet expansion MP Anil Desai after he was offered MoS post- Senior Sena leader Suresh Prabhu quit party to join BJP and was made a Union Cabinet Minister- After BJP's drubbing in Delhi polls, Uddhav claimed it was a defeat for Modi and waning of Modi wave- Sena's mouthpiece Saamana constantly takes potshots at BJP leadership at state and Centre- Sena opposed the state government's meat ban calling it an attack on Marathi eating habits- Despite Fadnavis' assurance of security for Ghulam Ali concert, it was called off after Sena's open threat- Fadnavis accused Sena of turning the state into banana republic after the latter threatened the launch of Kasuri's book",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/politics/why-shiv-sena-wants-to-end-alliancebjpmaha-1319891.html,Partnership,"After the BJP failed to get a clear majority in the Assembly, the ‘wounded’ Shiv Sena led by Uddhav Thackeray reluctantly re-united with the BJP extending support to the Devendra Fadnavis-led government.The BJP also ‘reluctantly’ accepted the support and offered Shiv Sena MLAs minor portfolios in Maharashtra Cabinet.Sena thinks that sitting in the opposition for the next four years would be more beneficial to the party rather than continuing with the alliance with no say in the matters of the state.BJP-Shiv Sena points of tussle- Sena peeved after its representative in Modi cabinet, Anant Geete wasn't given a meaty portfolio.- Differences over seat sharing before 2014 Assembly elections resulted in both sides contesting independently- Sena forced to forgo demand for Deputy CM and Home Ministry.- Sena at the 11th hour pulled back its nominee for Modi's Cabinet expansion MP Anil Desai after he was offered MoS post- Senior Sena leader Suresh Prabhu quit party to join BJP and was made a Union Cabinet Minister- After BJP's drubbing in Delhi polls, Uddhav claimed it was a defeat for Modi and waning of Modi wave- Sena's mouthpiece Saamana constantly takes potshots at BJP leadership at state and Centre- Sena opposed the state government's meat ban calling it an attack on Marathi eating habits- Despite Fadnavis' assurance of security for Ghulam Ali concert, it was called off after Sena's open threat- Fadnavis accused Sena of turning the state into banana republic after the latter threatened the launch of Kasuri's book","['BJP', 'Assembly', 'Uddhav Thackeray', 'BJP', 'the Devendra Fadnavis-led', 'BJP', 'Maharashtra Cabinet', 'BJP', 'Anant Geete', 'Assembly', 'CM', 'MoS', 'BJP', 'Union Cabinet', 'BJP', 'BJP', 'Marathi', 'Fadnavis accused Sena']",[]

Tips to lease out your property for film and ad shoots,17 October,"What if your house is transformed into a glitzy film set one day, abound with artsy furnishing, props and your favourite stars? While this may be exciting, several risks also exist. Finding overturned settees, broken vases, trampled plants or smeared paintings post the event, would definitely come as a shock. It is hence, advisable to sign a contract beforehand, which clearly states the legal implications in case of any damages to the property. Mark Butt, who owns a sprawling 40,000 sq ft vintage villa at Saligaon area in north Goa, often gives out his house for film shoots. The 46-year-old, who rented out his house for the movie ‘Singham’ and several smaller advertisements, explains that the pay varies between Rs 50,000 and Rs 1.5 lakhs, per day. “I have given out my house for film shoots several times. It usually happened via word-of-mouth and there was no written contract signed because I knew the production team well. Although there have been minor damages in some cases, the film team compensated for it,” says Butt. In case of unknown film companies however, Butt feels that it is better to sign a written contract and seek legal assistance, taking into account all clauses involving loss or damages. Add damages clause in the contracts Such contracts should clearly prohibit the parties from making any changes, unless specifically agreed upon by the parties. The film company should also return the house in the condition it was taken and the company should be insured, in case of any eventuality. The contract should also clearly state the duration, for which the film company is allowed use the property and the charges involved, in case of delays/extensions. Damages are generally of two kinds – damages to the property and damages to the furniture. While damages cannot be completely avoided, people must take preventive measures, insists Rahul Ajatshatru, an advocate at the Bombay High Court. “The owner must take a hefty security deposit from the film company. After the shooting is completed, the owner should check the entire house, make an estimate of the loss and get back to the film company, with the required charges,” says Ajatshatru. Contract and its importance Property owners should ensure that they are legally protected and are able to meet the terms and conditions in the contract. “A key point to consider, is whether the production company requires sole and exclusive rights to use the property during the specified dates. Then, the landlord could also sue the company for damages, based on the agreement,” says Pooja Dutta, advocate and managing director of Astute Law firm. Most importantly, the contract signed between the property owner and the film company should be registered. The agreement should specify the nature of the use and the area of the house allotted for the shoot. “In case the licensee overstays, they could be evicted. All cover charges should be mentioned clearly. While regular wear and tear is accepted, the agreement should provide for any other damage to the property,” says advocate Jay Bhatia. Points to consider, before giving out your house for film shoots Registration: The contract between the property owner and the production company should be registered. Time frame and overstaying: In case the licensee overstays the lease period, they could be evicted. Cover charges: All cover charges should be mentioned clearly. While regular wear and tear is acceptable, in case of any major damage done to the property, the film company should be made to adequately compensate for it. Nature of use: The purpose for which the property can be used, should be mentioned clearly, to avoid illegal activities. Security deposit: Ideally, the owner must take a hefty security deposit from the film company.By: Housing.com/news",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/personal-finance/tips-to-lease-out-your-property-for-filmad-shoots-956674.html,Partnership,"After the shooting is completed, the owner should check the entire house, make an estimate of the loss and get back to the film company, with the required charges,” says Ajatshatru.The agreement should specify the nature of the use and the area of the house allotted for the shoot.",[],[]

Sebi issues operational guidelines on 'scheme of arrangement' for entities with listed debt securities,18 November,"Markets regulator Sebi has put in place operational guidelines pertaining to ”scheme of arrangement” by entities who have listed their debt securities — non-convertible debt securities or non-convertible redeemable preference shares.Scheme of arrangement is a court-approved agreement between a company and its shareholders or creditors. The guidelines came after the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi), earlier this week, amended rules with respect to scheme of arrangement, involving merger, amalgamation among others by entities who have listed their Non-Convertible Debt securities (NCDs) or Non-Convertible Redeemable Preference Shares (NCRPS).The amended rules provide that the entity that has listed NCDs or NCRPS, which intends to undertake a scheme of arrangement or is involved in a scheme of arrangement would file the draft scheme with stock exchanges for obtaining the no-objection letter, before filing such scheme with any court or tribunal.Further, the exchange would have to forward such draft schemes to Sebi. In case of entities that are debt listed and have raised money by way of a public issue or private placement of NCDs/ NCRPS, they are required to comply with certain requirements before the scheme of arrangement is filed with the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT), Sebi said in a circular made public on Friday.As per the operational guidelines, listed entities would have to choose one of the stock exchanges having nationwide trading terminals as the designated bourse for the purpose of coordinating with Sebi.The listed entity would have to submit documents, including draft scheme of arrangement, valuation report, fairness opinion on the valuation of assets done by a registered valuer, report from the board of directors of the listed entity recommending the draft scheme, audited financials for the last 3 years and auditor’s certificate to the stock exchanges.Further, the listed entity is required to disclose the draft scheme along with all the documents on its website simultaneously while filing it with the stock exchange. Also, the entity would have to disclose the no-objection letter of the bourse on its website within 24 hours of receiving the same.All listed entities would have to ensure that all dues and fines imposed by Sebi, stock exchanges and the depositories have been settled before filing the draft scheme with the bourse.In case of scheme of arrangement between listed and unlisted entities, the listed entity would include information pertaining to the unlisted entity involved in the scheme in a specified format in the proposal to be sent to the holders of NCDs/ NCRPS while seeking an approval for the scheme.After receiving the draft scheme and documents, the exchange would have to forward the same to Sebi within three working days and the bourse can seek clarifications, if any, from the registered valuer or the statutory auditors of the listed entity, within 10 working days. The exchange would have to provide the ’no-objection’ letter to Sebi on the draft scheme within seven working days from the date of receipt of satisfactory reply on clarifications.”The stock exchanges shall ensure that the maximum number of days taken for providing the ’no-objection’ letter to Sebi shall not exceed 30 days from the date of receipt of the draft scheme of arrangement,” the regulator said.Pursuant to receipt of the ’no-objection’ letter from the bourse, Sebi will have to provide comments on the draft scheme to the exchange. While processing the draft scheme, Sebi may seek clarifications from any person relevant in this regard, including the listed entity, exchange and may also seek an opinion from an expert.After this, Sebi will provide comments on the draft scheme to the exchange within 30 days. The listed entity or resultant entity would have to ensure that steps for listing of NCDs or NCRPS issued pursuant to the scheme of arrangement, are completed and trading commences within 60 days of receiving NCLT’s order, simultaneously on all the exchanges, where the NCDs/ NCRPS are listed.

"Flat delayed by four years, NCDRC tells builder to refund homebuyer Rs 3.4 crore with interest",27 July,"The country's top consumer court has directed Gurugram-based Pioneer Urban Land & Infrastructure Ltd to refund the entire principal amount of Rs 3.45 crore with interest and Rs 25,000 as litigation cost to a homebuyer for a four-year delay in handing over of an apartment.The National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (NCDRC) also held as wholly one-sided and unfair the terms of an “apartment buyer’s agreement” signed between the two sides. The court overlooked the developer’s argument that the delay was because of circumstances that were out of its control.“The interest at 9 percent per annum has been awarded in the light of the observation of the honourable Supreme Court in a catena of judgments awarding interest, keeping in view the current market situation and that the banks have lowered the interest rates,” the order dated July 23 said.In view of the disruption caused by the coroanvirus outbreak, the court gave the developer three months to comply with the order, failing interest rate will be raised to 12 percent.The homebuyer alleged “deficiency in service” as the developer didn’t complete the construction or handed over the possession by October 2015 deadline as mentioned in the Apartment Buyer’s Agreement of March 7, 2012  for a unit of super area of approximately 3,498 sq ft.The homebuyer applied for a house in the Pioneer Group’s housing project Araya in Sector 62 in Haryana’s Gurugram, by paying a booking amount of Rs 30 lakh, the court was told.The developer was to apply for the occupation certificate of the project within 39 months from the date of the excavation. The developer was also allowed a grace period of 180 days.The money asked by the developer from the buyer at the time of excavation was paid in June 2012 but on visiting the site, they found no work had started, the buyer said.The site looked like an abandoned piece of land, with some construction here and there. There was no one to address their queries, the buyer said.By December 16, 2015, the buyer had paid Rs 3.22 crore, almost 95 percent of the apartment cost.  The apartment was delivered late in 2019.Even after five years, the developer failed to give possession of the unit. Repeated requests, letters, email, phone calls and even personal visits didn’t help, the court was told.The homebuyer also alleged that they were forced to sign a one-sided agreement. The builder, as per the agreement, had agreed to pay compensation at the rate of Rs 10 per sq ft per month for the delay.But, if calculated in terms of financial charges, it comes to approximate at the rate of 1.4 percent p.a. rate of interest and even these charges were to be paid after 39 months which is period for completion of construction, the buyer had said.The consumer court held that the agreement was unfair to the homebuyer. “The builder could not seek to bind the respondent with such one-sided contractual terms,” the order said.The builder said that delay was due to the reasons beyond their control.The builder also said the complainants wanted “to seek more than the contractual benefits from the developer” and were expecting high speculative gains but failed due to a depressed real estate market.""The continuing support of NCDRC for homebuyers is very encouraging and shows the strict approach of the court.

How home buyers can protect their interests,23 November,"The long term growth of the real estate market, depends a lot on how the home buyers are empowered to take decisions and given a platform to fight for their rights. Legal recourse is normally the last option for any home buyer, when something goes wrong. Nevertheless, there are several measures that buyers can take, to empower themselves. Home buyers also need to be proactive in their decision making, by using various new-age analytical tools available in the market. “Customers, today, are already taking informed decisions and making comparisons over digital and mobile platforms,” says Sumit Jain, national director – residential services, at Colliers International. Marketing that focuses on enhancing customers’ experience, is likely to become a key enabler and make easier for customers to evaluate purchases, adds Jain. See also: Will the warranty clause in the Real Estate Act bring relief to home buyers? Proactive steps required Home buyers should make regular visits to the project site, to verify that the construction is progressing as per schedule. “The installments paid by the home buyers, are linked to the progress of the work carried out by the developer. Hence, site visits and follow-ups are a must,” maintains Ameet P Hariani, managing partner, Hariani & Co. Payments should be made, only after verifying the progress on the site. “These are necessary precautions that must be taken, to stay apprised of one’s investment and to avoid nasty surprises, in case of delays, default or fraud. It is also prudent to engage an attorney / lawyer and architect, to review a project before investing in it,” suggests Hariani. Experts point out that the time frame, within which the possession of the flat needs to be given to the purchaser, is governed by the agreement entered into with the developer. However, if a builder fails to commence the project even after considerable period has elapsed after entering into the agreement, appropriate legal steps can be initiated. Home buyers more empowered now than in the past The recently enacted Real Estate Regulation Act, provides for registration of projects and uploading of sanctioned plans on its official website, for easy access to flat purchasers and to boost transparency in such transactions. The Act also provides measures, to ensure that builders do not divert funds from one project to another. “In the long run, this will benefit the real estate sector at large. As buyers turn proactive and their concerns are addressed, there will be renewed accountability and transparency. This will bring efficiency in the market,” opines Pankaj Kapoor, founder and MD of Liases Foras, a real estate ratings and research agency. The Indian real estate market is a cyclical one, just like other realty markets across the world. Buyers and investors need to understand these cycles, as well as the specific dynamics driving the real estate markets in their part of the country. “Thanks to rapid internet penetration and consumer awareness, people now have access to a lot of information, which was out of reach in previous years. This allows them to make more informed investment decisions,” says Santhosh Kumar, CEO – operations and international director, JLL India.  Experts also cite several recent cases, related to delayed possessions that have been decided in favour of the home buyers. The first step towards customers’ empowerment, according to experts, begins with home buyers becoming aware, alert and proactive.By: Housing.com/news",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/personal-finance/how-home-buyers-can-protect-their-interests-928366.html,Partnership,"The long term growth of the real estate market, depends a lot on how the home buyers are empowered to take decisions and given a platform to fight for their rights.Experts point out that the time frame, within which the possession of the flat needs to be given to the purchaser, is governed by the agreement entered into with the developer.",[],[]

Tips to lease out your property for film and ad shoots,17 October,"What if your house is transformed into a glitzy film set one day, abound with artsy furnishing, props and your favourite stars? While this may be exciting, several risks also exist. Finding overturned settees, broken vases, trampled plants or smeared paintings post the event, would definitely come as a shock. It is hence, advisable to sign a contract beforehand, which clearly states the legal implications in case of any damages to the property. Mark Butt, who owns a sprawling 40,000 sq ft vintage villa at Saligaon area in north Goa, often gives out his house for film shoots. The 46-year-old, who rented out his house for the movie ‘Singham’ and several smaller advertisements, explains that the pay varies between Rs 50,000 and Rs 1.5 lakhs, per day. “I have given out my house for film shoots several times. It usually happened via word-of-mouth and there was no written contract signed because I knew the production team well. Although there have been minor damages in some cases, the film team compensated for it,” says Butt. In case of unknown film companies however, Butt feels that it is better to sign a written contract and seek legal assistance, taking into account all clauses involving loss or damages. Add damages clause in the contracts Such contracts should clearly prohibit the parties from making any changes, unless specifically agreed upon by the parties. The film company should also return the house in the condition it was taken and the company should be insured, in case of any eventuality. The contract should also clearly state the duration, for which the film company is allowed use the property and the charges involved, in case of delays/extensions. Damages are generally of two kinds – damages to the property and damages to the furniture. While damages cannot be completely avoided, people must take preventive measures, insists Rahul Ajatshatru, an advocate at the Bombay High Court. “The owner must take a hefty security deposit from the film company. After the shooting is completed, the owner should check the entire house, make an estimate of the loss and get back to the film company, with the required charges,” says Ajatshatru. Contract and its importance Property owners should ensure that they are legally protected and are able to meet the terms and conditions in the contract. “A key point to consider, is whether the production company requires sole and exclusive rights to use the property during the specified dates. Then, the landlord could also sue the company for damages, based on the agreement,” says Pooja Dutta, advocate and managing director of Astute Law firm. Most importantly, the contract signed between the property owner and the film company should be registered. The agreement should specify the nature of the use and the area of the house allotted for the shoot. “In case the licensee overstays, they could be evicted. All cover charges should be mentioned clearly. While regular wear and tear is accepted, the agreement should provide for any other damage to the property,” says advocate Jay Bhatia. Points to consider, before giving out your house for film shoots Registration: The contract between the property owner and the production company should be registered. Time frame and overstaying: In case the licensee overstays the lease period, they could be evicted. Cover charges: All cover charges should be mentioned clearly. While regular wear and tear is acceptable, in case of any major damage done to the property, the film company should be made to adequately compensate for it. Nature of use: The purpose for which the property can be used, should be mentioned clearly, to avoid illegal activities. Security deposit: Ideally, the owner must take a hefty security deposit from the film company.By: Housing.com/news",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/personal-finance/tips-to-lease-out-your-property-for-filmad-shoots-956674.html,Partnership,"After the shooting is completed, the owner should check the entire house, make an estimate of the loss and get back to the film company, with the required charges,” says Ajatshatru.The agreement should specify the nature of the use and the area of the house allotted for the shoot.",[],[]

A guide to renting out your property,16 September,"Real estate has always been a lucrative investment option for Indians. Many people will invest in a second and third home to earn rental income. Here is what you need to about the risks involved in renting out your property. Low rental yield: The returns from rental housing are not very high. “In most cities, the yield is barely 2-3%,” points out Sanjay Sharma, MD, Qubrex, a Gurgaon-based real estate consultancy. On the positive side, however, rental returns are inflation-adjusted. It is usually possible to revise the rent each year, unless there is a supply glut. Hence, the return on your historical cost, improves as time goes by. Potential expenses: All repairs have to be undertaken by the landlord. If the house needs major repair, the cost can eat away a substantial portion of the income earned that year. The house also has to be painted every time a tenant vacates.  See also: Tips for landlords: Earn safe returns on your property Vacancy risk: If the house remains vacant for a few months after the previous tenant has moved out, your cash flow gets disrupted. Tenant issues: Difficult tenants may not pay rent on time. The problem assumes a serious proportion if payments are defaulted continuously. The tenant could also misuse the property, undertaking commercial activities in a residential unit, or even use it for illegal activities. The landlord should be watchful that the tenant pays the society’s maintenance charges and the utility bills, on time. Finding the right tenant Research: Before speaking to potential tenants, find out the current rental rate in the area to avoid quoting a rate that is out of sync. You can charge a higher rate only if you have expanded the area of the apartment or furnished the house. Advertise: Post a flyer on the notice board of your housing society with the resident welfare association’s (RWA) permission. You may also inform local brokers. Many potential tenants approach them when looking for an apartment in an area. Another option is to list your property online. Police verification: Once you have found a client, you will have to get police verification done. This has become mandatory. Download the verification form from the police department’s website. Fill it and submit it at the local police station along with the tenant’s proof of identity. The police will then conduct a background check and provide approval accordingly. Rent agreement: This document, usually prepared by the real estate agent, must mention a few things explicitly. It must specify the start and end dates of the lease and the total period. The norm in the residential market is to have a lease period of 11 months. The agreement should also mention the rights and obligations of both, the landlord and the tenant in case one of them wants to terminate the lease before 11 months. The agreement should also state the date on which the rent will be paid. If the tenant is handing over post-dated cheques, it should mention the number of cheques and the repercussions if a cheque bounces. The rent agreement should also mention clearly who will be responsible for repairs. Usually, minor repairs are taken care of by the tenant. Register the agreement: Get the rental agreement registered. The cost of stamp duty may have to be borne by the landlord, or it could be shared with the tenant. “The rent agreement will have greater validity in a court of law if it is registered and not just notarised,” points out Sujit Kumar, a Delhi-based high court lawyer.

Here‘s why you should thoroughly read your builder-buyer agreement,08 August,"The builder-buyer agreement is an immensely important document as it is the legal contract between the builder and the buyer. If the developer does not keep his word on any count, it is the most important legal document that the buyer will have to fall back on. Many builder-buyer agreements are heavily tilted in the builder’s favour. We discuss some of the common provisions and their implications for you. Construction timeline The agreement says that the builder will offer possession of the apartment (usually) within 36-42 months from the ‘start of construction’. Note, that it does not say that possession will be offered within the specified time from the ‘date of booking’. The commencement of construction is entirely up to the builder’s discretion. Some developers take the liberty of considering construction to have started after the excavation work is completed. Price escalation clause Builders include this clause in the agreement which allows them to raise the price of the apartment. If the project has been delayed, it could be due to the builder’s fault. They then penalise the buyer by raising the cost, claiming that raw material and other input costs have increased. Area change The agreement could include a clause allowing the builder to change the square footage of the apartment. If it has increased, he charges extra for it. “What changes, is not the carpet area but the super area,” explains Anuj Sood, head of Noida-based Sood Properties. “You may end up paying 10-15% extra, while the benefit to you, in terms of the additional area, may be marginal or nil.” Payment delay The agreement says that if the buyer delays in paying an installment, there will be interest to pay as well. The charge could be hefty – as much as 18-24% compounded quarterly. The developer may even include a clause stating that if you delay payment beyond a point, he reserves the right to cancel your allotment and that you may have to forfeit the earnest money, which could be as high as 20-25% of the total cost. The balance will be returned to you without any interest. See also: Tips to verify your flat purchase documents without a lawyer Payment on ‘actual cost basis’ The agreement may say that you will have to pay for certain items on actual cost basis at the time of possession. He may then spring an unpleasant surprise by demanding an unexpectedly high amount. This could be for things like club membership, electricity connection charge, etc. Similarly, at the time of booking, he may not specify the PLC (preferential location charges). Later, he could charge you anywhere from Rs 100 to 500. Building plan changes According to norms prevailing in some states, if the developer changes the building plan, he must take the buyer’s written consent. “Some developers have now begun to insert a page in the builder-buyer agreement, wherein, they take the consent beforehand,” adds Sood. Transfer charges This has to be paid to the developer if the apartment is resold before possession. Often, this charge is not disclosed clearly. Just for changing the name of the owner of a flat in his records, he could charge Rs 25-500 per sq ft. Finally, there is the question of what the buyer can do if the builder-buyer agreement is tilted in the developer’s favour. Ideally, the buyer should be able to get the document changed. “In reality, developers refuse to change the provisions of the agreement, arguing that it is a standard document,” points out Bibhash Surya, head of Sri Sai Dreamlands, a Noida-based real estate consultancy. “The buyer usually has no option but to walk away from very toxic contracts.”By: Housing.com/news",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/personal-finance/hereâ€™syou-should-thoroughly-read-your-builder-buyer-agreement-974713.html,Partnership,"“You may end up paying 10-15% extra, while the benefit to you, in terms of the additional area, may be marginal or nil.” Payment delay The agreement says that if the buyer delays in paying an installment, there will be interest to pay as well.The developer may even include a clause stating that if you delay payment beyond a point, he reserves the right to cancel your allotment and that you may have to forfeit the earnest money, which could be as high as 20-25% of the total cost.",[],[]
5 important things to check before booking a flat,04 August,"Buying a property often involves shelling out a significant amount of one’s hard-earned savings. For many, even this may not be sufficient to meet the cost of the house and the remaining amount may be paid through a bank loan. In such cases, the equated monthly installments (EMIs) on the loan will take away a portion of the borrower’s monthly income. It’s crucial to invest safely with so much at stake. Verify the price of the property First, ascertain your budget and look for a property in that price bracket. A property commands a certain price due to its locality and amenities. Once the developer quotes a price for the apartment, compare it with neighbouring areas and properties. Information on property prices can be sourced from newspaper supplements, listings on property portals and brokers operating in the region. Builder-buyer agreement When a buyer books a flat by paying a token amount, he or she receives an allotment letter. After this, one has to enter into a tripartite agreement with the builder and the lending bank for the remaining amount. The builder-buyer agreement should be signed at this stage. Often, this agreement is biased in favour of the developer and it is in the buyer’s interest to read this document and understand the clauses. For example, developers sometimes insert a clause that gives them the power to raise rates at the time of possession. The clause basically mentions that ‘due to unforeseen market conditions’ (such as rise in the prices of raw materials) and ‘factors out of their control’ or ‘increase in the size of apartment’, the developer can increase the rate by a certain amount. The same is charged through a demand letter at the time of possession. Recently, a similar case came up in the Noida Extension region, where a well-known builder sent letters to his allottees seeking more money for completed flats. Location and its upcoming infrastructure It is equally important to analyse the location of the project. “A home buyer should look at factors, such as the surrounding social and physical infrastructure, amenities offered in the project and connectivity to other neighbouring regions. A region with ready amenities will help you settle down easily in your new house,” says Manish Saluja, a Delhi-based chartered financial planner. See also: 5 mistakes to avoid while buying a home Possession of your apartment According to industry estimates, a significant number of residential and commercial projects are facing delays. Consequently, prospective buyers should make realistic assessments of a given project’s timelines. A project’s delivery depends on factors, such as availability of funds with the developer, sales of the project, supply of raw materials, etc. In addition, construction during the monsoon season, is generally slow. Therefore, most developers seek a six-month grace period for the final delivery of the project. The contract with the developer should specifically explain in detail this grace period. The builder will thus, be liable to pay a penalty that usually ranges from Rs 5-7 per sq ft, if he is unable to give timely possession of your apartment. However, the penalty paid by the developer is determined by the base price, which does not include extra charges for parking, club membership, etc. “Many developers also offer appropriate rent for the apartment, if handing over of possession is delayed,” says Ashwinder Raj Singh, CEO, Residential Services, JLL India. Additional charges The pricing of an apartment may also include charges, such as club membership, parking, preferential location charges, development charges and power back-up. These charges are generally embedded in the payment schedule and collected at regular intervals. At the time of registration, one also needs to pay stamp duty and registration charges, which is calculated on the property’s value and varies according to the region. It is in your favour to understand these charges and prepare yourself accordingly.By: Housing.com/news",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/personal-finance/5-important-things-to-check-before-bookingflat-975698.html,Partnership,"Often, this agreement is biased in favour of the developer and it is in the buyer’s interest to read this document and understand the clauses.The clause basically mentions that ‘due to unforeseen market conditions’ (such as rise in the prices of raw materials) and ‘factors out of their control’ or ‘increase in the size of apartment’, the developer can increase the rate by a certain amount.",[],[]
Tips to verify your flat purchase documents without a lawyer,25 July,"Due diligence and awareness of your rights can certainly protect you against unscrupulous practices by developers. In an industry that still lacks transparency, it is best to physically inspects all documents before buying any property. First and foremost, drafting a sale agreement should be done with the utmost care. A property buyer should fully understand its contents; if necessary recruit a lawyer, and make a clear note of all the deliverables the developer has agreed to. Anuj Puri, chairman and country head of JLL India, cautions that “Developer’s sales teams will usually present a buyer with a readymade agreement, and a buyer must ensure that this captures every relevant detail.” He continues, “If it does not, the buyer is fully entitled to ask for missing details to be included and potential grey areas to be clarified. A copy of the final agreement must be retained under any circumstances, as this will serve as the primary evidence in a legal action filed for agreement violations.” Here is what you need to watch out for when checking purchase documents: 1. Personal details The agreement must capture the seller’s complete details. This includes father’s name, address, PAN number and bank account information. It must also provide exact details of the property’s location and municipal, tehsil (administrative division) or collector’s land record number. The agreement ought to be witnessed by two people, each from the buyer’s and seller’s side. 2. Title documents “The seller must confirm the authenticity of the title documents and ownership transfer in the agreement,” explains Puri. “He must also state clearly that the transfer and handing over of possession, is happening in a legal and fully-attested manner. The agreement must reflect the fact that all dues related to the property, have been cleared up to the date of transfer.” Further, the agreement must fully indemnify the buyer from any disputes related to title and possession of the property. 3. Date of possession “The date of possession of a flat is important to the purchaser, for the purpose of transfer of the flat from the builder. It is the date on which the purchaser is to get possession of the premises and binds the developer to hand over possession by the date set out in the agreement. If possession is not given by such date, the purchaser has a right to sue,” informs Anirudh Hariani, solicitor of Hariani and Company. The ‘time of essence’ clause in an agreement lays down the contractual deadlines for the parties to perform their due obligations. 4. Payment schedule “The clause which sets out the payment schedule, lays down the total amount to be paid and the time frame within which it is to be paid,” details Hariani. “In cases where the payment is made in instalments, the payment schedule specifies details of each instalment. This helps avoids any ambiguities which may arise in the future,” points out Hariani. The agreement must provide complete payment details by the buyer, including that of the mortgage, if any. See also: Before paying, ensure seller isn’t lying about existing loans on property 5. Termination The termination clause defines the consequences imposed on the parties in case of deviation from the code of conduct expected to be adhered by them. The agreement may contain either a ‘termination by convenience’ clause where either party can end the agreement. 6. Dispute resolution The dispute resolution clause sets out the mechanism by which the parties can resolve their disputes. This is alternative to settling the matter through litigation. Besides this, other processes used to settle commercial contracts include adjudication and mediation. 7. Amenities The amenities clause helps the purchaser know the additional benefits he will be entitled to and mentions the supplementary amount towards maintenance charges. In case of any default on the amenities sought to be provided, the purchaser may consider it as a breach of contract. 8. Penalty A penalty clause should be incorporated in the purchase agreement, clearly specifying milestones and the penalties in case of failure from both, seller and buyer. Finally, registering a legal purchase agreement, is of benefit to the buyer, since it offers protection from legal complications at any stage of ownership or eventual resale. No change can be made once the purchase agreement is drafted and registered. If any change needs to be made, the consent of the buyer must be obtained and an addendum will be made in the agreement.

"5 mistakes to avoid, while buying a home",09 April,"Making mistakes while buying a home, could result in irreparable losses. Home buyers, who are lured by offers, discounts and freebies, tend to forget their actual requirement and hence, make mistakes.Mistake 1: Paying token money for buying a home, before the loan is approvedInexperienced buyers sometimes tend to pay the token money, merely to ensure that their dream house isn’t sold to someone else, points out Sushil Raheja, CEO of Raheja Homes Builders and Developers. “However, it is advisable to take the plunge, only after ascertaining the time that it will take, to get the home loan approved and the possible options, if it doesn’t get approved on time. Otherwise, you may get caught up in legal cases, or will have to forego the said house,” Raheja cautions.Mistake 2: Not reading the purchase agreement before buying a homeWhen a buyer does this, he makes himself vulnerable to fraud or forgery. This also means that the buyer has not verified the document and hence, is not aware if the house has all the requisite clearances. This is where you need a lawyer, to read through the document thoroughly and watch out for any loopholes.See also: Here’s why you should thoroughly read your builder-buyer agreementMistake 3: Opting for a home in a locality that faces problems, such as electricity shortage, water crisis or lack of infrastructureThis can end up being a long-term problem for the buyer. Such issues may also crop up in urban areas and buyers should, therefore, evaluate the location properly, before buying a project in the area.Mistake 4: Not discussing the fixed and variable costs, with the builderHome buyers who are not aware of all the expenses that they have to incur, may be in for a rude shock. Nowadays, several builders are slashing property prices but simultaneously increasing the maintenance and other charges quietly. Therefore, it is very important to know all the expenses in advance.Mistake 5: Ignorance of super built-up versus carpet areaProperties, whose prices are based on the super built-up area, always cost more than those based on the carpet area. It is better to insist that the builder quote a rate on the basis of carpet area.Things to keep in mindHome buyers should enlist the help of professionals, who can guide in the buying process. While buying a new property, preferably, choose a reputed developer. “One of the worst mistakes that a buyer can make, is extending on their budget. You must calculate the monthly costs before you buy a house and also evaluate your loan eligibility. Any kind of negligence, can lead to problems in ownership of the property,” suggests Hariprakash Pandey, senior vice-president – finance, HDIL. “Buy a house in a location that is not only convenient, but provides better value in the future. It should also have good connectivity to other places and adequate social infrastructure,” Pandey adds. The buyer should also check the title and the legal aspects of the property, maintain experts.By: Housing.com/news",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/trends/5-mistakes-to-avoid-while-buying-a-home-980717.html,Partnership,"Such issues may also crop up in urban areas and buyers should, therefore, evaluate the location properly, before buying a project in the area.Mistake 4: Not discussing the fixed and variable costs, with the builderHome buyers who are not aware of all the expenses that they have to incur, may be in for a rude shock.It is better to insist that the builder quote a rate on the basis of carpet area.Things to keep in mindHome buyers should enlist the help of professionals, who can guide in the buying process.",[],[]

Why stamp duty rates are important for income tax purposes&#8230;,08 July,"When you enter into an agreement to buy a property, you have to pay a certain amount to the government, which is known as stamp duty. The amount of stamp duty is generally based on the value of the property mentioned in the agreement. To avoid evasion of stamp duty through the undervaluation for agreements and to minimise the disputes on quantum of stamp duty, all state governments publish an area-wise, stamp duty ready reckoner on a yearly basis. If the value of the property based on the ready reckoner is higher, than the value of the property stated in the agreement, then, you will have to pay the stamp duty on the basis of the value computed from the rates in the ready reckoner. However, if the agreement value is higher than the ready reckoner valuation, the stamp duty payable will be calculated with reference to the agreement value. The stamp duty valuation also has implications on the income tax of buyers and sellers. Importance for the seller under income tax laws As per Section 50C of the Income Tax Act, in case the agreement value is lower than the stamp duty valuation, the law presumes that the seller has received an amount equal to the stamp duty valuation and the capital gains is computed accordingly. However, if the seller claims that the stamp duty valuation is higher than the fair market value of the property, the income tax officer can ask its valuation officer to assess the value the property for capital gains purpose. The value determined by this officer, shall be treated as the sale consideration of the property for income tax purpose. However, if the valuation given by the income tax officer is higher than the stamp duty valuation, such excess valuation shall be ignored and only the stamp duty valuation shall be treated as the sale consideration. This provision is applicable to all the tax payers, including limited companies. In cases, where the stamp duty valuation is higher than the agreement value, and the tax payer invests the net sale consideration under Section 54F to claim exemption from long-term capital gains, s/he may have to borrow money as the money received may be lower than the amount required to be invested. Importance for the buyer under income tax laws As per Section 56(2) (vii)(b) of the Income Tax Act, in case the stamp duty valuation of the purchased property is higher by more than Rs 50,000, then, the difference between the stamp duty valuation and the agreement value shall be treated as income of the buyer. This provision apples to Hindu undivided families (HUFs) and individuals only. However, if the agreement date and the date of registration are different and thus, the values on these dates are also different, the, the valuation as on the date of agreement can be considered for this purpose, only if full or part consideration was paid by means other than cash, either on or before the date of the agreement.
