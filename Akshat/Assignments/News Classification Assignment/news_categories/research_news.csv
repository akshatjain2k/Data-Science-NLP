Why Chief Data Officers are key to unlocking digital transformation for Indian businesses,27 March,"The Chief Data Officer (CDO) is a new important role in companies because data is becoming more important for business. The CDO works closely with other important people in the company and has a big influence across the organisation.A study by IBM Institute for Business Value found that CDOs are under a lot of pressure to deliver results. Their job can be different depending on the company, and they usually only stay in the role for 4.5 years.Companies want to use technology to grow their business, but they also need to make sure their data is safe. Most Indian CDOs said that making sure their data is secure is the most important thing. They also want to be ready to use the cloud.The study found that more than half of the Indian CDOs said that keeping data secure is the most important part of their job. But not all of them are confident that their company's data is safe. Because of this pressure, CDOs are looking for ways to create value and protect it at the same time.Siddhesh Naik, Country Leader, Data, AI & Automation, and Technology Sales, IBM India & South Asia, says, ""As Indian businesses continue to progress on their transformation journeys, their CDOs need to create a clear line of sight from data to value and engage with ecosystem partners – while making sure that their data investments accelerate business growth and are a central element of business model innovation.""Some of the key India findings in the 2023 study include:Most CDOs (76 percent) believe that data security is the most important part of their data architecture, followed closely by being cloud-ready (71%) and having fast, real-time access (70 percent). For 57 percent of CDOs, the most important responsibility is ensuring data security, and 56percent focus on increasing data ROI. Only 56 percent of CDOs think their company's data is secure, while 68% believe their customers' data is secure. CDOs are using AI and machine learning (67 percent), automation (64 percent), and hybrid cloud technology (66 percent) to unlock the value of data. Less than half (48 percent) of CDOs say that they are making better and faster decisions by using AI and data, and only 38 percent are using AI to automate decision-making. Over 61 percent of CDOs have set clear thresholds for automated decision-making. 74 percent of CDOs work with ecosystem partners who are highly involved in their data strategy. About 53 percent of CDOs say their data management strategy aligns with their digital transformation efforts.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/why-chief-data-officers-are-key-to-unlocking-digital-transformation-for-indian-businesses-10320981.html,Research,"Because of this pressure, CDOs are looking for ways to create value and protect it at the same time.Siddhesh Naik, Country Leader, Data, AI & Automation, and Technology Sales, IBM India & South Asia, says, ""As Indian businesses continue to progress on their transformation journeys, their CDOs need to create a clear line of sight from data to value and engage with ecosystem partners – while making sure that their data investments accelerate business growth and are a central element of business model innovation.""Some of the key India findings in the 2023 study include:Most CDOs (76 percent) believe that data security is the most important part of their data architecture, followed closely by being cloud-ready (71%) and having fast, real-time access (70 percent).","['Siddhesh Naik', 'Data', 'AI & Automation', 'Technology Sales', 'IBM India & South Asia', 'CDOs', 'CDOs']",[]
Plastic entering oceans could nearly triple by 2040 if left unchecked: Research,08 March,"Plastics entering the world's oceans have surged by an ""unprecedented"" amount since 2005 and could nearly triple by 2040 if no further action is taken, according to research published on Wednesday.An estimated 171 trillion plastic particles were afloat in the oceans by 2019, according to peer-reviewed research led by the 5 Gyres Institute, a U.S. organisation that campaigns to reduce plastic pollution.Marine plastic pollution could rise 2.6 fold by 2040 if legally binding global policies are not introduced, it predicted.The study looked at surface-level plastic pollution data from 11,777 ocean stations in six major marine regions covering the period from 1979 to 2019.""We've found an alarming trend of exponential growth in microplastics in the global ocean since the millennium,"" Marcus Eriksen, co-founder of the 5 Gyres Group said in a statement.""We need a strong legally binding U.N. global treaty on plastic pollution that stops the problem at the source,"" he added.Microplastics are particularly hazardous to the oceans, not only contaminating water but also damaging the internal organs of marine animals, which mistake the plastic for food.Experts said the study showed that the level of marine plastic pollution in the oceans has been underestimated.""The numbers in this new research are staggeringly phenomenal and almost beyond comprehension,"" said Paul Harvey, a scientist and plastics expert with Environmental Science Solutions, an Australian consultancy focused on pollution reduction.The United Nations kicked off negotiations on an agreement to tackle plastic pollution in Uruguay in November, with the aim of drawing up a legally binding treaty by the end of next year.Environmental group Greenpeace said that without a strong global treaty, plastic production could double within the next 10 to 15 years, and triple by 2050.A separate international treaty was agreed on Sunday to help protect biodiversity in the world's high seas.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/world/plastic-entering-oceans-could-nearly-triple-by-2040-if-left-unchecked-research-10215221.html,Research,"Plastics entering the world's oceans have surged by an ""unprecedented"" amount since 2005 and could nearly triple by 2040 if no further action is taken, according to research published on Wednesday.An estimated 171 trillion plastic particles were afloat in the oceans by 2019, according to peer-reviewed research led by the 5 Gyres Institute, a U.S. organisation that campaigns to reduce plastic pollution.Marine plastic pollution could rise 2.6 fold by 2040 if legally binding global policies are not introduced, it predicted.The study looked at surface-level plastic pollution data from 11,777 ocean stations in six major marine regions covering the period from 1979 to 2019.""The numbers in this new research are staggeringly phenomenal and almost beyond comprehension,"" said Paul Harvey, a scientist and plastics expert with Environmental Science Solutions, an Australian consultancy focused on pollution reduction.The United Nations kicked off negotiations on an agreement to tackle plastic pollution in Uruguay in November, with the aim of drawing up a legally binding treaty by the end of next year.Environmental group Greenpeace said that without a strong global treaty, plastic production could double within the next 10 to 15 years, and triple by 2050.A separate international treaty was agreed on Sunday to help protect biodiversity in the world's high seas.","['the 5 Gyres Institute', 'Environmental Science Solutions', 'United Nations', 'Greenpeace']",['An estimated 171 trillion']
Plastic consumption on course to nearly double by 2050: Research,27 February,"Plastic use in G20 countries is on course to nearly double by the middle of the century unless a comprehensive and legally binding global treaty to curb consumption is drawn up, according to research published on Monday.Existing programmes to boost recycling or cut single-use plastic consumption only ""scratched the surface"" and a more comprehensive global plan is required, according to Back to Blue, a research group run by the Economist Impact think-tank and the Nippon Foundation, a private philanthropic organisation.The United Nations kicked off negotiations on an agreement to tackle plastic pollution in Uruguay in November, with the aim of drawing up a legally binding treaty by the end of next year.

"Study shows Bitcoin unaffected by most Macroeconomic news, except inflation",09 February,"Bitcoin is immune to all macroeconomic news except inflation. This is in contrast to other traditional assets such as gold, silver, S&P 500 stocks, and currencies (exchange rates), which are sensitive to macroeconomic news.The US Federal Reserve Bank of New York on Wednesday unveiled a comprehensive 31-page report titled ""The Bitcoin – Macro Disconnect,"" which analysed the effect of macroeconomic news on Bitcoin and other assets.Below are the highlights:Cryptocurrency market cap hits $2.5 tn, Bitcoin crosses the $1 tn markAccording to the report, the market capitalisation of cryptocurrencies has rapidly expanded in recent years, reaching $2.5 trillion, with Bitcoin crossing the $1 trillion mark.The paper aimed to study the drivers of cryptocurrency prices and their properties compared to traditional assets.High-frequency data reveals Bitcoin immune to all macroeconomic news except inflationThe study was conducted with a high-frequency perspective and Bitcoin was chosen as the representative cryptocurrency.The researchers collected macroeconomic news, such as news about the inflation, and looked at forward-looking indicators, and studied the response of Bitcoin to these factors.The advantage of using high-frequency data is that it allowed the researchers to observe the response of asset prices to news in a short 30-minute window, which is the closest thing to a natural experiment in empirical finance.Bitcoin is unresponsive to monetary policy news, unexpected changes in short-term ratesDespite the researchers' expectation that Bitcoin should respond to monetary policy news and to changes in current and future real interest rates, the study found that Bitcoin was unresponsive to unexpected changes in the short-term rate, and its reaction to news about the future path of monetary policy was not robust.The study's contribution lies in the use of intraday dataThe researchers believe that their study's contribution lies in the use of intraday data to identify the effects of monetary and macroeconomic news on Bitcoin.While there have been numerous studies on the risk and return characteristics of cryptocurrencies and the response of US assets to macroeconomic news, this study is unique in its high-frequency approach, which provides a more precise estimate of the impact of news.“In our empirical analysis, we find that Bitcoin is unresponsive to both monetary and macroeconomic news.

Hindenburg vs Adani: The short seller taking on the Indian businessman,26 January,"Over the past few years, Nathan Anderson has made a name with analysis that sends stocks sinking.Now the activist short seller behind Hindenburg Research is going after his biggest game yet — what Hindenburg is calling, with characteristic chutzpah, “The Largest Con in Corporate History.’’His target: Indian industrialist Gautam Adani, a figure even richer than Bill Gates or Warren Buffett, with a net worth of $113.4 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.Hindenburg on Tuesday leveled a series of extraordinary allegations about the sprawling Adani Group conglomerate — the result, it said, of a two-year investigation into what it’s characterizing as a brazen scheme of stock manipulation and accounting fraud dating back decades.The report, which the Adani Group has called “maliciously mischievous” and “unresearched” promptly wiped $12 billion of market value.Hindenburg hopes that’s just the beginning. Adani says it’s exploring legal action.It’s a remarkable turn for Anderson, who first got Wall Street’s attention with takedowns of electric-vehicle makers Nikola Corp. and Lordstown Motors Corp. Little Hindenburg has never swung at a company as big and powerful as Adani Group. (Anderson briefly bet against Twitter Inc. as Elon Musk was buying the company and then turned bullish on the stock last July.)And so, the question is whether other investors will heed Hindenburg’s warnings about Adani, whose dizzying wealth cuts across India’s economic and political life.It’s difficult to overstate just how lopsided this fight is. Gautam Adani has spent four decades building a business empire spanning energy, agribusiness, real estate and defense, among others. He’s considered to have a close relationship with India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi, with his ambitious goals closely aligned with the government’s priorities.Anderson’s New York-based firm — technically a research and trading outfit, not a hedge fund with outside investors — is less than five years old and wagers its own money in the markets. Even in Manhattan’s financial circles, he’s hardly a big name.And yet Anderson has managed to make a mark lately. Hindenburg, named after the German airship that blew up in 1937, has targeted about 30 companies since 2020. On average, their stocks fell about 15% the next day, and were down 26% six months later, according to calculations by Bloomberg News.Anderson declined to comment for this story. But Hindenburg is bracing for a blow-by-blow response from the Adani Group.Short sellers — and the controversies that often surround them — have been around for as long as there have been stocks. The Dutch briefly outlawed the practice in the 1600s after traders shorted the Dutch East India Company, purportedly the first company in the world to issue shares. Lately, US authorities have looked into whether some shorts have occasionally colluded to attack companies. Hindenburg hasn’t been accused of wrongdoing, but some of its peers have been sounding the retreat.Hindenburg’s MO is simple. Anderson and his team dig into companies and look for malfeasance. One high-profile example: Electric-vehicle maker Nikola, which Hindenburg called an “ocean of lies.’’ Last October, Nikola founder Trevor Milton was convicted of defrauding investors.For all the noise that Hindenburg makes, Anderson himself keeps a low profile.He grew up in a small town in Connecticut and earned a business degree from the University of Connecticut.During college, he lived for a time in Israel, working as a paramedic while taking classes at Hebrew University. He later worked for a financial analytics company before taking a job checking out potential deals for the investment firms of wealthy families. His passion, he’s said, is to “find scams.’’Early on, he spent hours looking into potential Ponzi schemes and occasionally teamed up with forensic accountant Harry Markopolos, who famously tried to warn federal authorities about Bernard Madoff. Anderson has called Markopolos a role model.Around 2014, Anderson started filing whistleblower complaints with US authorities in hopes of collecting bounties for unearthing fraud.One of his first big gets: Looking into hedge fund Platinum Partners with Markopolos. Seven executives were subsequently charged with fraud.Today Hindenburg employs about 10 people, a mix of former journalists and analysts. Sometimes, hedge funds have joined in on its trades.Even if Adani beats back Hindenburg, and the odds are squarely in Adani’s favor, Anderson has no shortage of work left to do.“There’s still plenty of fraud out there,” Anderson told the New York Times last October. “If there’s ever a time that I feel that most of the corporate fraud in America has been eliminated, then I’ll probably announce that I’ll go grow tomatoes, or something.”​",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/hindenburg-vs-adani-the-short-seller-taking-on-the-indian-businessman-9943481.html,Research,"Over the past few years, Nathan Anderson has made a name with analysis that sends stocks sinking.Now the activist short seller behind Hindenburg Research is going after his biggest game yet — what Hindenburg is calling, with characteristic chutzpah, “The Largest Con in Corporate History.’’His target: Indian industrialist Gautam Adani, a figure even richer than Bill Gates or Warren Buffett, with a net worth of $113.4 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.Hindenburg on Tuesday leveled a series of extraordinary allegations about the sprawling Adani Group conglomerate — the result, it said, of a two-year investigation into what it’s characterizing as a brazen scheme of stock manipulation and accounting fraud dating back decades.The report, which the Adani Group has called “maliciously mischievous” and “unresearched” promptly wiped $12 billion of market value.Hindenburg hopes that’s just the beginning.One high-profile example: Electric-vehicle maker Nikola, which Hindenburg called an “ocean of lies.’’ Last October, Nikola founder Trevor Milton was convicted of defrauding investors.For all the noise that Hindenburg makes, Anderson himself keeps a low profile.He grew up in a small town in Connecticut and earned a business degree from the University of Connecticut.During college, he lived for a time in Israel, working as a paramedic while taking classes at Hebrew University.","['Hindenburg Research', 'the Bloomberg Billionaires Index', 'Adani Group', 'the Adani Group', 'Nikola', 'the University of Connecticut', 'Hebrew University']","['$113.4\xa0billion', '$12 billion']"
Teenager's aggressive cancer clears a month after cutting-edge treatment,11 December,"Doctors in Britain have hailed a pioneering treatment for an aggressive form of leukaemia, after a teenager became the first patient to be given a new therapy and went into remission.The 13-year-old girl, identified only as Alyssa, was diagnosed with T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia in 2021.But her blood cancer did not respond to conventional treatment, including chemotherapy and a bone marrow transplant.She was enrolled on a clinical trial of a new treatment at London's Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children (GOSH) using genetically engineered immune cells from a healthy volunteer.In 28 days her cancer was in remission, allowing her to receive a second bone marrow transplant to restore her immune system.Six months on, she is ""doing well"" back home in Leicester, central England, and receiving follow-up care.""Without this experimental treatment, Alyssa's only option was palliative care,"" the hospital said in a statement on Sunday.Robert Chiesa, a GOSH consultant, said her turnaround had been ""quite remarkable"", although the results still needed to be monitored and confirmed in the next few months.Cutting edgeAcute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) is the most common kind of cancer in children and affects cells in the immune system, known as B cells and T cells, which fight and protect against viruses.GOSH said Alyssa was the first patient known to have been given base-edited T cells, which involves chemically converting single nucleotide bases -- letters of the DNA code -- which carry instructions for a specific protein.Researchers at GOSH and University College London helped develop the use of genome-edited T cells to treat B-cell leukaemia in 2015.But to treat some other types of leukaemia the team had to overcome the challenge that T cells designed to recognise and attack cancerous cells had ended up killing each other during the manufacturing process.Multiple additional DNA changes were needed to the base-edited cells to allow them to target cancerous cells without damaging each other.""This is a great demonstration of how, with expert teams and infrastructure, we can link cutting edge technologies in the lab with real results in the hospital for patients,"" said GOSH consultant immunologist and professor Waseem Qasim.""It's our most sophisticated cell engineering so far and paves the way for other new treatments and ultimately better futures for sick children.""Alyssa said in the statement she was spurred to take part in the trial not just for herself but for other children.Her mother, Kiona, added: ""Hopefully this can prove the research works and they can offer it to more children.""The researchers were presenting their findings this weekend at the annual meeting of the American Society of

How COVID-19 causes neurological damage found,15 November,"COVID-19 may cause damage to the nervous system, even though it does not affect nerve cells, according to a small study.While it was not uncommon for some people to lose their sense of taste and smell due to a Covid-19 infection, in others, the disease had had an even stronger impact on the nervous system, with effects ranging from lasting concentration problems to strokes, the study said.Researchers, from the University of Basel and University Hospital Basel, Switzerland, have studied the mechanisms responsible for and reported new insights into the development of ""neuro-Covid"", including identifying starting points for its prevention, the study said.The team investigated how different severities of neuro-COVID can be detected and predicted by analysing the cerebrospinal fluid and blood plasma of affected individuals. Their findings, published in the journal Nature Communications, also indicate how to prevent neurological damage due to Covid-19.The study included 40 Covid-19 patients with differing degrees of neurological symptoms. In order to identify typical changes associated with neuro-Covid, the team of researchers compared cerebrospinal fluid and blood plasma of these individuals with samples from a control group. They also measured the brain structures of test subjects and surveyed participants 13 months after their illness in order to identify any lasting symptoms.Particularly in the group with the most serious neurological symptoms, the researchers identified a link with an excessive immune response.On the one hand, the study said, affected individuals showed indications of impairment of the blood-brain barrier, which the study's authors speculate was probably triggered by a ""cytokine storm"", a massive release of pro-inflammatory factors in response to the virus.On the other hand, the researchers also found antibodies that targeted parts of the body's own cells, in other words, signs of an autoimmune reaction, as a result of the excessive immune response, the study said.""We suspect that these antibodies cross the porous blood-brain barrier into the brain, where they cause damage,"" explained lead researcher Gregor Hutter. Researchers also identified excessive activation of the immune cells specifically responsible for the brain, the microglia.In a further step, Hutter and his team investigated whether the severity of neurological symptoms is also perceptible in brain structures.Indeed, they found that people with serious neuro-Covid symptoms had a lower brain volume than healthy participants at specific locations in the brain and particularly at the olfactory cortex, that is, the area of the brain responsible for smell.""We were able to link the signature of certain molecules in the blood and cerebrospinal fluid to an overwhelming immune response in the brain and reduced brain volume in certain areas, as well as neurological symptoms,"" says Hutter, adding that it is now important to examine these biomarkers in a greater number of participants.The aim, the study said, would be to develop a blood test that can already predict serious cases, including neuro-Covid and long Covid, at the start of an infection.These same biomarkers point to potential targets for drugs aimed at preventing consequential damage due to a Covid-19 infection. One of the biomarkers identified in blood, the factor MCP-3, plays a key role in the excessive immune response, and Hutter believes there is the potential to inhibit this factor medicinally, the study said.""In our study, we show how coronavirus can affect the brain,"" he says. ""The virus triggers such a strong inflammatory response in the body that it spills over to the central nervous system. This can disrupt the cellular integrity of the brain."" Accordingly, Hutter said that the primary objective must be to identify and halt the excessive immune response at an early stage, the study said.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/health-and-fitness/how-covid-19-causes-neurological-damage-found-9539591.html,Research,"COVID-19 may cause damage to the nervous system, even though it does not affect nerve cells, according to a small study.While it was not uncommon for some people to lose their sense of taste and smell due to a Covid-19 infection, in others, the disease had had an even stronger impact on the nervous system, with effects ranging from lasting concentration problems to strokes, the study said.Researchers, from the University of Basel and University Hospital Basel, Switzerland, have studied the mechanisms responsible for and reported new insights into the development of ""neuro-Covid"", including identifying starting points for its prevention, the study said.The team investigated how different severities of neuro-COVID can be detected and predicted by analysing the cerebrospinal fluid and blood plasma of affected individuals.They also measured the brain structures of test subjects and surveyed participants 13 months after their illness in order to identify any lasting symptoms.Particularly in the group with the most serious neurological symptoms, the researchers identified a link with an excessive immune response.On the one hand, the study said, affected individuals showed indications of impairment of the blood-brain barrier, which the study's authors speculate was probably triggered by a ""cytokine storm"", a massive release of pro-inflammatory factors in response to the virus.On the other hand, the researchers also found antibodies that targeted parts of the body's own cells, in other words, signs of an autoimmune reaction, as a result of the excessive immune response, the study said.","['COVID-19', 'the University of Basel', 'University Hospital Basel']",[]

COVID-19 treatments for better protection against future variants identified,31 August,"Researchers have identified new therapies for COVID-19 that they say could provide better protection against future variants and outbreaks.An international team led by researchers from the University of Kent in the UK and the Goethe-University in Germany tested the sensitivity of different SARS-CoV-2 Omicron and Delta viruses to combinations of the four currently approved antiviral drugs with betaferon.Betaferon is a class of antiviral drug that is also naturally produced in the body and protect it from virus infections. The recent COVID-19 waves have caused fewer hospitalisations and deaths than the initial ones — largely due to the immunity provided by vaccines, the researchers said.However, many people have defects in their immune systems and cannot effectively protect themselves from COVID-19 by vaccination and rely on effective antiviral therapies, they said.The researchers noted that threat of resistance formation for antiviral drugs, which can happen quickly and cause problems with treatment, also adds to the need for new treatments for future-proofing our protection against COVID-19.COVID-19 VaccineFrequently Asked QuestionsA vaccine works by mimicking a natural infection. A vaccine not only induces immune response to protect people from any future COVID-19 infection, but also helps quickly build herd immunity to put an end to the pandemic. Herd immunity occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population becomes immune to a disease, making the spread of disease from person to person unlikely. The good news is that SARS-CoV-2 virus has been fairly stable, which increases the viability of a vaccine.There are broadly four types of vaccine — one, a vaccine based on the whole virus (this could be either inactivated, or an attenuated [weakened] virus vaccine); two, a non-replicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of SARS-CoV; three, nucleic-acid vaccines that have genetic material like DNA and RNA of antigens like spike protein given to a person, helping  human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine; and four, protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombinant proteins of SARS-COV-2 along with an adjuvant (booster) is given as a vaccine.Vaccine development is a long, complex process. Unlike drugs that are given to people with a diseased, vaccines are given to healthy people and also vulnerable sections such as children, pregnant women and the elderly. So rigorous tests are compulsory. History says that the fastest time it took to develop a vaccine is five years, but it usually takes double or sometimes triple that time.The study, published in the Journal of Infection, found new combination therapies that are highly effective in cell culture experiments and that may reduce the formation of novel variants. ”These are exciting findings that will hopefully help to improve the treatment of vulnerable COVID-19 patients and to avoid the formation of resistant viruses as much as possible,” said Professor Martin Michaelis, from the University of Kent.Currently, there are three approved antiviral drugs for the treatment of COVID-19: remdesivir, molnupiravir, and nirmatrelvir — the active agent in paxlovid. Moreover, aprotinin is an approved drug, whose anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity was discovered by the same research team, and it was recently shown to be beneficial in COVID-19 patients.The findings show that interferon combination with molnupiravir, nirmatrelvir, and aprotinin were much more effective than interferon combinations with remdesivir. This may explain, why remdesivir/interferon combinations have so far shown limited improvement compared to remdesivir alone, according to the researchers. Interferon combinations with the other three drugs should be tested in the clinics, they said.”If these findings are confirmed in patients, I hope that more effective therapies will help us to reduce the formation of novel dangerous COVID-19 variants,” said Professor Jindrich Cinatl from Goethe-University.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/coronavirus/covid-19-treatments-for-better-protection-against-future-variants-identified-9112371.html,Research,"Researchers have identified new therapies for COVID-19 that they say could provide better protection against future variants and outbreaks.An international team led by researchers from the University of Kent in the UK and the Goethe-University in Germany tested the sensitivity of different SARS-CoV-2 Omicron and Delta viruses to combinations of the four currently approved antiviral drugs with betaferon.Betaferon is a class of antiviral drug that is also naturally produced in the body and protect it from virus infections.The good news is that SARS-CoV-2 virus has been fairly stable, which increases the viability of a vaccine.There are broadly four types of vaccine — one, a vaccine based on the whole virus (this could be either inactivated, or an attenuated [weakened] virus vaccine); two, a non-replicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of SARS-CoV; three, nucleic-acid vaccines that have genetic material like DNA and RNA of antigens like spike protein given to a person, helping  human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine; and four, protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombinant proteins of SARS-COV-2 along with an adjuvant (booster) is given as a vaccine.Vaccine development is a long, complex process.","['the University of Kent', 'the Goethe-University', 'Delta', 'RNA']",[]

Scientists discover 'weak spot' across all major COVID-19 variants,19 August,"A team led by an Indian-origin researcher has discovered a key vulnerability across all major variants of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, including the recently emerged BA.1 and BA.2 Omicron subvariants.The weakness can be targeted by neutralising antibodies, potentially paving the way for treatments that would be universally effective across variants, the researchers said.The study, published on Thursday in the journal Nature Communications, used cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) to reveal the atomic-level structure of the vulnerable spot on the virus' spike protein, known as an epitope -or part to which an antibody attaches itself. Spike protein is used by the SARS-CoV-2 virus to enter and infect human cells. The researchers also described an antibody fragment called VH Ab6 that is able to attach to this site and neutralise each major variant.""This is a highly adaptable virus that has evolved to evade most existing antibody treatments, as well as much of the immunity conferred by vaccines and natural infection,"" said Sriram Subramaniam, a professor at the University of British Columbia, and the study's senior author. ""This study reveals a weak spot that is largely unchanged across variants and can be neutralised by an antibody fragment. It sets the stage for the design of pan-variant treatments that could potentially help a lot of vulnerable people,"" Subramaniam said. Antibodies are naturally produced by our bodies to fight infection, but can also be made in a laboratory and administered to patients as a treatment.While several antibody treatments have been developed for COVID-19, their effectiveness has waned in the face of highly-mutated variants like Omicron. ""Antibodies attach to a virus in a very specific manner, like a key going into a lock. But when the virus mutates, the key no longer fits,"" said Subramaniam.COVID-19 VaccineFrequently Asked QuestionsA vaccine works by mimicking a natural infection.

The 'master key' identified by researchers is the antibody fragment VH Ab6, which was shown to be effective against the Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, Kappa, Epsilon and Omicron variants.The fragment neutralises SARS-CoV-2 by attaching to the epitope on the spike protein and blocking the virus from entering human cells. By mapping the molecular structure of each spike protein, the team has been searching for areas of vulnerability that could inform new treatments.""The epitope we describe in this paper is mostly removed from the hot spots for mutations, which is why its capabilities are preserved across variants,"" said Subramaniam. ""Now that we have described the structure of this site in detail, it unlocks a whole new realm of treatment possibilities,"" he said.Subramaniam said this key vulnerability can now be exploited by drug makers, and because the site is relatively mutation-free, the resulting treatments could be effective against existing, and even future, variants.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/coronavirus/scientists-discover-weak-spot-across-all-major-covid-19-variants-9058071.html,Research,"A team led by an Indian-origin researcher has discovered a key vulnerability across all major variants of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, including the recently emerged BA.1 and BA.2 Omicron subvariants.The weakness can be targeted by neutralising antibodies, potentially paving the way for treatments that would be universally effective across variants, the researchers said.The study, published on Thursday in the journal Nature Communications, used cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) to reveal the atomic-level structure of the vulnerable spot on the virus' spike protein, known as an epitope -or part to which an antibody attaches itself.The good news is that SARS-CoV-2 virus has been fairly stable, which increases the viability of a vaccine.There are broadly four types of vaccine — one, a vaccine based on the whole virus (this could be either inactivated, or an attenuated [weakened] virus vaccine); two, a non-replicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of SARS-CoV; three, nucleic-acid vaccines that have genetic material like DNA and RNA of antigens like spike protein given to a person, helping  human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine; and four, protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombinant proteins of SARS-COV-2 along with an adjuvant (booster) is given as a vaccine.Vaccine development is a long, complex process.","['Omicron', 'Nature Communications', 'RNA']",[]
"Fatigue, headache among top lingering symptoms months after COVID-19: Study",08 August,"Fatigue and headache were the most common symptoms reported by people an average of over four months after recovering from COVID-19, according to a study.The research, recently published in the journal Brain, Behaviour, & Immunity - Health, found that muscle aches, cough, changes in smell and taste, fever, chills and nasal congestion were next in the long line of lingering symptoms.The findings support the growing evidence that there are chronic neuropsychiatric symptoms following COVID-19 infections, the researchers said. ""There are a lot of symptoms that we did not know early on in the pandemic what to make of them, but now it is clear there is a long COVID syndrome and that a lot of people are affected,"" said Elizabeth Rutkowski, a neurologist at Augusta University in Georgia and the study's corresponding author.The preliminary findings involved 200 patients, who were recruited on average about 125 days after testing positive for COVID-19. Eighty per cent of the participants reported neuropsychiatric symptoms with fatigue, the most common symptom, reported by 68.5 per cent, and headache close behind at 66.5 per cent.Just over half reported changes in smell (54.5 per cent) and taste (54 per cent) and nearly half the participants (47 per cent) met the criteria for mild cognitive impairment, the researchers said.

No participants reported having a stroke, weakness or inability to control muscles involved with speaking, and coordination problems were some of the less frequently reported symptoms, they said.Twenty-five per cent met the criteria for depression, and diabetes, obesity, sleep apnea and a history of depression were associated with those who met the criteria. Anemia and a history of depression were associated with the 18 per cent who met the objective criteria for anxiety. While the findings to date are not surprising and are consistent with what other researchers are finding, Rutkowski said the fact that symptoms reported by participants often did not match what objective testing indicated, was surprising.For example, the majority of participants reported taste and smell changes, but objective testing of both these senses did not always line up with what they reported. A higher percentage of those who did not report the changes actually had evidence of impaired function based on objective measures, the researchers said. While the reasons are not certain, part of the discrepancy may be a change in the quality of the participant's taste and smell rather than pure impaired ability, the researchers said.Either way, the data suggests a persistent loss of taste and smell following COVID-19, they added.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/coronavirus/fatigue-headache-among-top-lingering-symptoms-months-after-covid-19-study-8978551.html,Research,"Eighty per cent of the participants reported neuropsychiatric symptoms with fatigue, the most common symptom, reported by 68.5 per cent, and headache close behind at 66.5 per cent.Just over half reported changes in smell (54.5 per cent) and taste (54 per cent) and nearly half the participants (47 per cent) met the criteria for mild cognitive impairment, the researchers said.The good news is that SARS-CoV-2 virus has been fairly stable, which increases the viability of a vaccine.There are broadly four types of vaccine — one, a vaccine based on the whole virus (this could be either inactivated, or an attenuated [weakened] virus vaccine); two, a non-replicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of SARS-CoV; three, nucleic-acid vaccines that have genetic material like DNA and RNA of antigens like spike protein given to a person, helping  human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine; and four, protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombinant proteins of SARS-COV-2 along with an adjuvant (booster) is given as a vaccine.Vaccine development is a long, complex process.",['RNA'],"['Eighty per cent', '68.5 per cent', '66.5 per cent', '54.5 per cent', '54 per cent', '47 per cent', '32 per cent', '21 per cent', '18 per cent']"
Smartphone use may help improve memory skills: Study,02 August,"Using smartphones and other digital devices could help improve memory skills, rather than causing people to become lazy or forgetful, according to a study.The research, published in Journal of Experimental Psychology: General, showed that digital devices help people to store and remember very important information. This, in turn, frees up their memory to recall additional less important things, the researchers said.Neuroscientists have previously expressed concerns that the overuse of technology could result in the breakdown of cognitive abilities and cause ""digital dementia."" However, the findings show that using a digital device as external memory not only helps people to remember the information saved into the device, but it also helps them to remember unsaved information too. The researchers developed a memory task to be played on a touchscreen digital tablet or computer.The test was undertaken by 158 volunteers aged between 18 and 71. Participants were shown up to 12 numbered circles on the screen, and had to remember to drag some of these to the left and some to the right. The number of circles that they remembered to drag to the correct side determined their pay at the end of the experiment. One side was designated ""high value,"" meaning that remembering to drag a circle to this side was worth 10 times as much money as remembering to drag a circle to the other ""low value"" side.Participants performed this task 16 times. They had to use their own memory to remember on half of the trials, and they were allowed to set reminders on the digital device for the other half. The results found that participants tend to use the digital devices to store the details of the high-value circles. And, when they did so, their memory for those circles was improved by 18 per cent. Their memory for low-value circles was also improved by 27 per cent, even in people who had never set any reminders for low-value circles. However, results also showed a potential cost to using reminders.When they were taken away, the participants remembered the low-value circles better than the high-value ones, showing that they had entrusted the high-value circles to their devices and then forgotten about them. ""We wanted to explore how storing information in a digital device could influence memory abilities,"" said senior author Sam Gilbert from University College London (UCL) in the UK.""We found that when people were allowed to use an external memory, the device helped them to remember the information they had saved into it. This was hardly surprising, but we also found that the device improved people’s memory for unsaved information as well,"" Gilbert said. The results show that external memory tools work, the researchers said, adding far from causing 'digital dementia,' using an external memory device can even improve our memory for information that we never saved.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/technology/smartphone-use-may-help-improve-memory-skills-study-8938521.html,Research,"Participants were shown up to 12 numbered circles on the screen, and had to remember to drag some of these to the left and some to the right.They had to use their own memory to remember on half of the trials, and they were allowed to set reminders on the digital device for the other half.",[],"['18 per cent', '27 per cent']"
"Tech Mahindra, Mahindra University to set up lab for Metaverse, quantum computing",23 July,"Tech Mahindra and Mahindra University have signed a memorandum of understanding to set up a new 'Makers Lab' for research and development in quantum computing, explainable artificial intelligence and Metaverse. Tech Mahindra already has 10 Makers Lab across the world and the new unit at Mahindra University will be the 11th facility globally and second in Hyderabad.Emphasising the need to focus on development of quantum computing, Tech Mahindra MD and CEO CP Gurnani told PTI, the industry is looking at data explosion with growth in cloud computing, data centres and 5G driving the change in the present computing system. ""I think the basics of quantum computing is quantum physics. Quantum physics clearly shows that there is always this inflection point and then after that, either the current hardware or the quant developers will be able to suddenly create magic. My only personal belief is that the pressure on the systems will come in because of the data explosion,"" he said.Mahindra University Vice Chancellor Yajulu Medury said that one of the best things about the MoU is that it is an academia-industry collaboration. ""We have a lot of faculty in quantum physics, AI area, etc but this is actually work getting channelized into the forefront of industry-driven areas. Whether you talk about quantum computing, 5G, our faculty is now able to work with Tech Mahindra Makers Lab and other people and look at various ways of actually taking more industry-oriented work,"" Medury said.As a part of the partnership, the students of Mahindra University will get an opportunity to work on intellectual properties made within the Makers Lab and get deployed in R&D projects on the campus. The students will also collaborate with coding groups like Engima within the university to get access to projects, internships, and employment opportunities.Tech Mahindra Global Head for Makers Lab, Nikhil Malhotra said quantum computing is at a very nascent stage and there's a lot of noisy structure coming in. ""This partnership is all about what is the future of Quantum Technology. We are seeing two or three major things. One is in the drug design industry because we are essentially seeing that quantum can actually take over the space for molecule designs much better than the current AI systems. That's a huge huge market in terms of the drug design industry,"" he said.Makers Lab will focus on the effect of quantum on image optimisation for satellites etc and explore work on explainable AI(artificial intelligence) in collaboration with Mahindra University, Malhotra said.

"Vitamin B6 supplements may reduce anxiety, depression: Study",19 July,"Taking high-dose Vitamin B6 supplements may reduce the feelings of anxiety and depression, according to a study.Scientists at the University of Reading in the UK measured the impact of high doses of Vitamin B6 on young adults and found that they reported feeling less anxious and depressed after taking the tablets every day for a month.The study, published in the journal Human Psychopharmacology: Clinical and Experimental, provides valuable evidence to support the use of supplements thought to modify levels of activity in the brain for preventing or treating mood disorders. ""The functioning of the brain relies on a delicate balance between the excitatory neurons that carry information around and inhibitory ones, which prevent runaway activity"", said study lead author David Field, from the University of Reading.""Recent theories have connected mood disorders and some other neuropsychiatric conditions with a disturbance of this balance, often in the direction of raised levels of brain activity"", Field said. The researchers noted that vitamin B6 helps the body produce a specific chemical messenger that inhibits impulses in the brain, and the study links this calming effect with reduced anxiety among the participants.While previous studies have produced evidence that multivitamins can reduce stress levels, few studies have been carried out into which particular vitamins contained within them drive this effect. The latest study focused on the potential role of Vitamins B6, which is known to increase the body’s production of GABA (Gamma-Aminobutyric Acid), a chemical that blocks impulses between nerve cells in the brain.In the study, more than 300 participants were randomly assigned either vitamin B6 or B12 supplements approximately 50 times the recommended daily allowance or a placebo, and took one a day with food for a month. The study showed that Vitamin B12 had little effect compared to placebo over the trial period, but Vitamin B6 made a statistically reliable difference.Raised levels of GABA among participants who had taken vitamin B6 supplements were confirmed by visual tests carried out at the end of the trial, supporting the hypothesis that B6 was responsible for the reduction in anxiety. Subtle but harmless changes in visual performance were detected, consistent with controlled levels of brain activity, the researchers said.""Many foods, including tuna, chickpeas and many fruits and vegetables, contain vitamin B6. However, the high doses used in this trial suggest that supplements would be necessary to have a positive effect on mood,"" Field said. ""It is important to acknowledge that this research is at an early stage and the effect of vitamin B6 on anxiety in our study was quite small compared to what you would expect from medication. However, nutrition-based interventions produce far fewer unpleasant side effects than drugs, and so in the future people might prefer them as an intervention,"" he added.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/trends/health-trends/vitamin-b6-supplements-may-reduce-anxiety-depression-study-8850821.html,Research,"Taking high-dose Vitamin B6 supplements may reduce the feelings of anxiety and depression, according to a study.Scientists at the University of Reading in the UK measured the impact of high doses of Vitamin B6 on young adults and found that they reported feeling less anxious and depressed after taking the tablets every day for a month.The study, published in the journal Human Psychopharmacology: Clinical and Experimental, provides valuable evidence to support the use of supplements thought to modify levels of activity in the brain for preventing or treating mood disorders.The latest study focused on the potential role of Vitamins B6, which is known to increase the body’s production of GABA (Gamma-Aminobutyric Acid), a chemical that blocks impulses between nerve cells in the brain.In the study, more than 300 participants were randomly assigned either vitamin B6 or B12 supplements approximately 50 times the recommended daily allowance or a placebo, and took one a day with food for a month.","['the University of Reading', 'Human Psychopharmacology', 'Experimental', 'GABA', 'B12']",[]

"Focus on direct benefit transfer errors may hurt real, potential beneficiaries: Report",03 June,"The government's attempt to eliminate ineligible candidates from its welfare transfer may eventually lead to exclusion of some potential beneficiaries, anticipated a study by a research house.The so-called direct benefit transfers (DBT), kicked off in 2013, have resulted in an estimated gain of Rs 2.23 lakh crore to the exchequer from launch until March 2021. DBT seeks to ensure timely delivery of government doles to accurately identified beneficiaries through the use of online banking and Aadhaar infrastructure.“The DBT architecture has been designed to eliminate ghost beneficiaries, with the main objective of reducing ‘leakages’ in welfare delivery,” Dvara Research said in the summary of its State of Exclusion Report. “However, the focus on reduction of inclusion errors, i.e., ensuring that ineligible or undeserving citizens do not get access to government welfare programmes, comes at a cost.”The report, released on June 3, assess last-mile delivery challenges across a variety of cash transfer schemes, through surveys, case studies and stakeholder interviews spanning seven states. Dvara Research partnered with CMIE, Haqdarshak, Graam Vani and India Migration Now for the surveys.The nuts and bolts that underpin the DBT, like complete digitisation of records, seeding of Aadhaar with beneficiaries’ bank accounts, cash-out architecture, are not without fault lines, Dvara Research said.“Our research reveals exclusionary factors such as poor access point density (for enrolment/cash-out), data-entry errors in digitised payment processing, and cumbersome documentation requirements are exacerbated by sub-optimal accountability and grievance redress mechanisms,” it said.Also read: Free electricity makes little sense. DBT is the way forwardGovernment departments, financial service providers, statutory bodies and civil society organisations need to unclog the DBT pipeline to ensure that eligible beneficiaries do not have to run pillar to post.After all, in the financial year 2021-22, a total of 717 crore direct benefit transactions took place, amounting to a whooping Rs 6.30 lakh crore.

Academics is rife with research that’s bizarre but fun to read,08 May,"If you are dying to dive-deep into the details of how the 1857 revolt against the East India Company panned out in Devi Patan Mandal, help is at hand. In 2008, a researcher at the Dr Rammanohar Lohia Avadh University, Faizabad, did a PhD on the subject titled “1857 Ke Vidhroh Me Devi Patan Mandal Ka Yogdan”.No doubt the issue is of historical significance and full marks to the student and the guide for wading into such an esoteric topic.But the world of research is also littered with studies where the real question at the end is who wants to know? Two recent reports highlight the importance and sometimes the irrelevance of such research. One study study, by a team of researchers at the University of Bath, concluded, to everyone’s utter surprise, that a week off social media reduces depression and anxiety. The other is more generic. For years, research claiming that nature helps mental health has become a cause celebrated in books and magazines. Sadly, it seems such studies were a bit dodgy in their constructs. University of Vermont researchers have found that participants in such studies were overwhelmingly white, and that BIPOC (Black, Indigenous, People of Colour) communities were strongly underrepresented. Ergo, nature helps mental health, but that of largely white and rich people.Sometimes the research is well-intentioned, though the conclusions leave one gobsmacked. In 2007, researchers at the National University of Quilmes in Buenos Aires carried out a study to prove that Viagra cures hamster jetlag. Nor was the exercise done in jest. Nature magazine reported that the researchers injected hamsters with sildenafil (a class of medications called phosphodiesterase [PDE] inhibitors used to treat erectile dysfunction) and then pushed the animals' light/dark schedule ahead by six hours, roughly the equivalent of putting them on a plane from New York to Paris. Hamsters who'd had a dose of sildenafil adjusted their busy wheel-running schedules to the new light regime 50 percent faster. Sure, the effort might have been to see if the same would work with human beings as well. But jetsetting hamsters and humans don’t appear to have too much in common.Medical News Today also reported a 1994 study in which researchers found that women who take birth control pills blink more often than those who do not. In fact, they nailed it down very precisely, concluding that on average, women on birth control pills blink about 32 percent more than women who shunned this method of contraception.But nothing beats Time magazine’s list of 'The 10 Most Ridiculous Scientific Studies', topped by my personal favorite “Study shows beneficial effect of electric fans in extreme heat and humidity”. To think we didn’t know this little hack even as we sweltered in 45 degrees centigrade temperatures!That little gem is far overshadowed by another one on the list - being homeless is bad for your health. Is it now? And here we were brought up to believe that homes, those things that protect us from the heat, the cold, the rain and the sun, are critical to human existence. No sir.So why do people do these bizarre studies? Indian universities abound with many such intriguing scholastic works. Sample these: English for engineers - a needs analysis with special reference to REC Trichy; English spoken by educated Panjabi speakers in India a phonological study.Sure, getting a PhD is a major objective and the uniqueness of the proposed topic may have something to do with its acceptance, though where on earth do people find the guides who can assess the worth of the research on such topics.Many such studies are done by people who just want to be in the news. Perhaps they have an eye on the prestigious Ig Nobel Prize, the satiric award given every year since 1991 to celebrate 10 unusual or trivial achievements in scientific research. Quite fittingly, for 2021, the Ig Nobel Prize for economics was awarded to Pavlo Blavatskyy for his study on obesity levels among the cabinet ministers of 15 post-Soviet countries and the level of corruption in those countries.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/trends/lifestyle-trends/academics-is-rife-with-research-thats-bizarre-but-fun-to-read-8470511.html,Research,"In 2008, a researcher at the Dr Rammanohar Lohia Avadh University, Faizabad, did a PhD on the subject titled “1857 Ke Vidhroh Me Devi Patan Mandal Ka Yogdan”.No doubt the issue is of historical significance and full marks to the student and the guide for wading into such an esoteric topic.But the world of research is also littered with studies where the real question at the end is who wants to know?Sample these: English for engineers - a needs analysis with special reference to REC Trichy; English spoken by educated Panjabi speakers in India a phonological study.Sure, getting a PhD is a major objective and the uniqueness of the proposed topic may have something to do with its acceptance, though where on earth do people find the guides who can assess the worth of the research on such topics.Many such studies are done by people who just want to be in the news.","['the Dr', 'Rammanohar Lohia Avadh University', 'REC Trichy']",[]

"To build relationships, start with satisfying internal customers",05 February,"Building customer relationships is becoming the mantra these days for many companies although India is still a market where anything goes. Service levels are still at a dismal level and frustrations of many are ignored totally by companies as business is coming from other customers. Irony is that every other company is equally bad. For instance, if you have ever changed your telecom service provider post the portability rule, you would have soon realised your mistake. Chances are that the new service provider is worse than the old one.Nevertheless, at some level, many companies are trying to do more research on building one-to-one relationships with customers. The advent of latest research techniques, combined with technology tools, help in driving quick changes to distribution, promotion and advertising. This is useful for the long-term development of relationships. Competitive advantage lies in a distinct set of customer franchise. Done right, it will help to know the customers intimately. But then the question is whether customers want that much intimacy. Even with such issues around, it is still clear how a relationship is going to benefit both the company and the customers –long-term value and profitability for companies while ease, better value, trust and hassle-free services for the customers.But what about the employees? They are so critical for the success of any relationship programme and yet what is in it for them? I do not know of any company that is actually looking at employee benefits in driving better customer relationships. In the end, it is the employee who makes the touchpoint and creates the moment of truth for the company and the customer. Can the employee benefit from such relationships and if so how can that help companies become more profitable?If you look closely, today sales folks do not get any special incentive for building relationships. Of course, you can argue that they will have better job security and steady salary, etc. but then that is not really an incentive to build customer franchise. What a few organisations are doing today is some form of ESOP to employees as incentives to build relationships. The inherent idea is that they benefit when the company’s bottom line improves and for getting there sales folks need to build sales and relationships. However, this is a very indirect route to be qualified as an inventive linked to building relationship with your customers. Just as companies reward customers for being loyal with cash discounts or reward points, why can’t employees too get direct incentives on repeat customer sales, say in a retail outlet like Lifestyles? That would probably drive the behaviour and attitude of frontline sales force to deepen the customer relationship.As an example consider the Lifestyles Store in Bangalore. If the section saleswoman believes that every customer walking into her section is a potential long-term one, and if she knows that she will be rewarded for making the customer come back, her behaviour will be completely different from the indifferent attitude one sees today. They will be more service oriented, responsive and genuinely interested in the customer need. So what Lifestyles could do is perhaps when the customer makes his third purchase or so from that section or anywhere in the outlet, the saleswoman is rewarded either a commission or points, which she can monetise at the end of the month. If she is on a commission plus salary basis, she may even be given a hike in commission percentage. This reward system can increase as the relationship deepens. Lifestyles can also give reward points for each ongoing purchase a Platinum member makes with a particular saleswoman.The idea here is about diverting attention from driving one-off sales to increasing relationships with your company. This requires the salesperson to tap into the needs of individual customers and provide individualised service rather than pushing for the one-off sale. If as a customer you do not get a good experience, you are not going to come back even if you bought a shirt from the salesperson. Essentially it is only commonsense that both the customer and the employee are rewarded appropriately to make them do business with each other again.The strategy of an organisation should be linked to the long-term relationship of customers and must have the support of the top leadership for it to succeed. Once it is embedded in strategic intent, a balanced scorecard process can ensure successful execution at every level with clear measurable goals. The four perspectives of the balanced scorecard will ensure that both customers and employees are taken care of with the right culture, leadership and processes. Eventually that will help the organisation achieve its financial goals, the ultimate measure that the strategy has succeeded.In the short-term before a balanced scorecard programme is implemented, SMEs can take a few steps as outlined below to see tremendous improvements:Deploy a training programme to teach employees how to sense and deliver individualised customer service.Communicate your strategy of long-term relationships to both customers and employees.Design and implement an incentive system for employees that will increase with the depth of relationship they have with customers.Leverage such relationships to develop other relationships through word-of-mouth using customer-get-customer kind of schemes.Decrease promotional expenses as you create more delighted customers.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/to-build-relationships-start-with-satisfying-internal-customers-8035051.html,Research,"Essentially it is only commonsense that both the customer and the employee are rewarded appropriately to make them do business with each other again.The strategy of an organisation should be linked to the long-term relationship of customers and must have the support of the top leadership for it to succeed.Eventually that will help the organisation achieve its financial goals, the ultimate measure that the strategy has succeeded.In the short-term before a balanced scorecard programme is implemented, SMEs can take a few steps as outlined below to see tremendous improvements:Deploy a training programme to teach employees how to sense and deliver individualised customer service.Communicate your strategy of long-term relationships to both customers and employees.Design and implement an incentive system for employees that will increase with the depth of relationship they have with customers.Leverage such relationships to develop other relationships through word-of-mouth using customer-get-customer kind of schemes.Decrease promotional expenses as you create more delighted customers.",[],[]
Brain problems found in 1 percent of hospitalised COVID-19 patients; real-world data shows Moderna vaccine highly effective,02 December,"The following is a summary of some recent studies on COVID-19. They include research that warrants further study to corroborate the findings and that has yet to be certified by peer review, Reuters reported.Brain problems seen in 1 percent of hospitalised COVID-19 patientsRoughly one in every 100 patients hospitalised with COVID-19 will likely have central nervous system complications, researchers reported on November 30 at the annual meeting of the Radiological Society of North America.Among nearly 38,000 patients hospitalised with COVID-19 in the United States and Europe, symptoms led doctors to suspect brain complications in about 11 percent.Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) exams confirmed central nervous system abnormalities that were most likely associated with the virus in 10 percent of those patients, for an overall incidence of 1.2 percent.COVID-19 VaccineFrequently Asked QuestionsA vaccine works by mimicking a natural infection. A vaccine not only induces immune response to protect people from any future COVID-19 infection, but also helps quickly build herd immunity to put an end to the pandemic. Herd immunity occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population becomes immune to a disease, making the spread of disease from person to person unlikely. The good news is that SARS-CoV-2 virus has been fairly stable, which increases the viability of a vaccine.There are broadly four types of vaccine — one, a vaccine based on the whole virus (this could be either inactivated, or an attenuated [weakened] virus vaccine); two, a non-replicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of SARS-CoV; three, nucleic-acid vaccines that have genetic material like DNA and RNA of antigens like spike protein given to a person, helping  human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine; and four, protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombinant proteins of SARS-COV-2 along with an adjuvant (booster) is given as a vaccine.Vaccine development is a long, complex process. Unlike drugs that are given to people with a diseased, vaccines are given to healthy people and also vulnerable sections such as children, pregnant women and the elderly. So rigorous tests are compulsory. History says that the fastest time it took to develop a vaccine is five years, but it usually takes double or sometimes triple that time.The most common finding was stroke due to clogged arteries, but the researchers also saw bleeding in the brain, inflammation of the brain, and other potentially fatal complications.Study leader Dr Scott Faro of Thomas Jefferson University in Philadelphia said in a statement that while the lung problems related to COVID-19 are well recognised, ""Our study shows that central nervous system complications represent a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in this devastating pandemic.""Moderna vaccine effectiveness not limited to clinical trialsModerna's mRNA COVID-19 vaccine is proving effective in the real world, according to doctors at Kaiser Permanente in California who have been tracking nearly 706,000 adults, half of whom had received the vaccine.Five months after the second dose, the vaccine was still 87 percent effective against SARS-CoV-2 infection, 96 percent effective against COVID-19 hospitalisation, and 98 percent effective against COVID-19 death, researchers reported in The Lancet Regional Health - Americas.Despite a wide range of chronic diseases among those in the study, the vaccine's effectiveness against infection ranged from 83 percent to 92 percent across age, sex, racial, and ethnic subgroups, researchers said.Immunologist E. John Wherry of the University of Pennsylvania, who was not involved in the Kaiser study, said it is ""highly unlikely"" that the Omicron variant of the virus can completely evade all of the immune defences induced by the vaccines and that current boosters will likely ""provide increased protection against this variant.""COVID-19 at childbirth linked with higher risks; antibody drugs appear to be safePregnant women with COVID-19 face higher risks of childbirth complications than those who are not infected by the coronavirus, a new study found.A separate study suggests mildly or moderately ill pregnant women with COVID-19 can safely be treated with monoclonal antibody drugs such as those from Regeneron Pharmaceuticals.The analysis of childbirth complications included 244,645 births, 874 of which were in infected women.Researchers reported on November 30 in PLOS Medicine that miscarriage and stillbirth rates did not differ between the groups.But after accounting for women's risk factors, researchers found that those with COVID-19 had 80 percent higher odds of having too much amniotic fluid, doubled odds of dangerously high blood pressure, more than doubled odds of amniotic infection, nearly tripled odds of hemorrhage during delivery, and nearly doubled odds of hemorrhage afterward. They were also at higher risk for preterm delivery.""Pregnant women and those who plan to conceive... are strongly encouraged to be vaccinated,"" said study leader Dr. Sylvie Epelboin of the University of Paris.Meanwhile, doctors at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota treated 51 pregnant patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 with one of several monoclonal antibody treatments.""No adverse effects were reported, and no patient required COVID-19 related hospitalization,"" they reported on Sunday on medRxiv ahead of peer review.So far, 29 of the women have delivered healthy babies. There was one miscarriage due to a congenital defect not related to the medication.The investigators note that while the infusions were well tolerated, the study was a small one.Further research is recommended to fully assess safety and efficacy in pregnancy, they said.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/brain-problems-found-in-1-percent-of-hospitalised-covid-19-patients-real-world-data-shows-moderna-vaccine-highly-effective-7783711.html,Research,"The good news is that SARS-CoV-2 virus has been fairly stable, which increases the viability of a vaccine.There are broadly four types of vaccine — one, a vaccine based on the whole virus (this could be either inactivated, or an attenuated [weakened] virus vaccine); two, a non-replicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of SARS-CoV; three, nucleic-acid vaccines that have genetic material like DNA and RNA of antigens like spike protein given to a person, helping  human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine; and four, protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombinant proteins of SARS-COV-2 along with an adjuvant (booster) is given as a vaccine.Vaccine development is a long, complex process.""Moderna vaccine effectiveness not limited to clinical trialsModerna's mRNA COVID-19 vaccine is proving effective in the real world, according to doctors at Kaiser Permanente in California who have been tracking nearly 706,000 adults, half of whom had received the vaccine.Five months after the second dose, the vaccine was still 87 percent effective against SARS-CoV-2 infection, 96 percent effective against COVID-19 hospitalisation, and 98 percent effective against COVID-19 death, researchers reported in The Lancet Regional Health - Americas.Despite a wide range of chronic diseases among those in the study, the vaccine's effectiveness against infection ranged from 83 percent to 92 percent across age, sex, racial, and ethnic subgroups, researchers said.Immunologist E.

IIT-Madras researchers develop new approach for 'accurate detection' of earthquakes,14 November,"Indian Institute of Technology-Madras researchers claim to have developed a new approach for accurate detection of earthquakes, which they say will provide a small lead time to save lives.An estimate of accurate time of arrival of non-destructive waves of earthquakes would not only help in developing a robust early warning system but also gives a lead time of approximately 30 seconds to 2 minutes till the destructive surface waves hit the ground, they said.“The proposed framework is not necessarily limited to the detection of seismic events but is generic and can be used for fault detection and isolation in other domains as well,” Prof Arun K Tangirala, Department of Chemical Engineering, IIT Madras, said.The research was carried out by Kanchan Aggarwal, a PhD Scholar, under the guidance of Tangirala. The findings have been published in the peer-reviewed open access scientific journal PLOS ONE.The proposed solution results in accurate detection and picking of the first waves in earthquake signals, which provide a small time window for charting measures to save lives.This lead time is sufficient to shut down nuclear reactors, metro and to park the elevators in high-rises at the nearest floor, among numerous other measures that can save countless lives.A solution to the P-wave detection problem that is robust, accurate and precise was essential to estimate the event details correctly and to reduce the damage caused by the earthquake or other triggered events, said Aggarwal.P-waves, or primary waves, cause the ground to compress and expand that is to move back and forth in the direction of travel. They are called primary waves because they are the first type of wave to arrive at seismic recording stations, says Encyclopeida Britannica.This work proposes a novel real-time automatic P-wave detector and picker in the prediction framework with a time-frequency localisation feature.Highlighting the practical applications of this research, Tangiral said, “The framework can incorporate any predictive models including the machine-learning and deep-learning models, which will reduce the human intervention in the detection.”The proposed approach brings a diverse set of capabilities in accurately detecting and the P-wave onset, especially in low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions that all the existing methods fail to attain.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/india/iit-madras-researchers-develop-new-approach-for-accurate-detection-of-earthquakes-7717331.html,Research,"Indian Institute of Technology-Madras researchers claim to have developed a new approach for accurate detection of earthquakes, which they say will provide a small lead time to save lives.An estimate of accurate time of arrival of non-destructive waves of earthquakes would not only help in developing a robust early warning system but also gives a lead time of approximately 30 seconds to 2 minutes till the destructive surface waves hit the ground, they said.“The proposed framework is not necessarily limited to the detection of seismic events but is generic and can be used for fault detection and isolation in other domains as well,” Prof Arun K Tangirala, Department of Chemical Engineering, IIT Madras, said.The research was carried out by Kanchan Aggarwal, a PhD Scholar, under the guidance of Tangirala.The findings have been published in the peer-reviewed open access scientific journal PLOS ONE.The proposed solution results in accurate detection and picking of the first waves in earthquake signals, which provide a small time window for charting measures to save lives.This lead time is sufficient to shut down nuclear reactors, metro and to park the elevators in high-rises at the nearest floor, among numerous other measures that can save countless lives.A solution to the P-wave detection problem that is robust, accurate and precise was essential to estimate the event details correctly and to reduce the damage caused by the earthquake or other triggered events, said Aggarwal.P-waves, or primary waves, cause the ground to compress and expand that is to move back and forth in the direction of travel.","['Indian Institute of Technology-Madras', 'Department of Chemical Engineering', 'IIT Madras', 'PLOS ONE.The', 'Aggarwal']",[]
IIT Madras researchers find high levels of pharmaceutical contaminants in the Cauvery river,10 October,"Researchers at Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Madras have found that the waters of River Cauvery are polluted with contaminants that include pharmaceutically active compounds, personal care products, plastics, flame retardants, heavy metals, and pesticides.Pharmaceutical contamination is particularly serious in India. These drug compounds, when released even in minuscule amounts into water bodies, can harm human beings and the ecosystem. A team of researchers from IIT Madras led by Dr Ligy Philip, Nita and KG Ganapathi Institute Chair Professor, Department of Civil Engineering, IIT Madras, quantified the seasonal distribution of emerging contaminants and pollutants in the River Cauvery. Assessing the quality of the river water helps understand the factors that influence the distribution of contaminants and their impact on the ecosystem.  There was significant contamination by metals such as arsenic, zinc, chromium, lead and nickel. Freshwater intake points were also found to be loaded with extraordinarily high concentrations of pharmaceutical contaminants.These pharmaceutical contaminants included anti-inflammatories like ibuprofen and diclofenac, anti-hypertensives such as atenolol and isoprenaline, enzyme inhibitors like perindopril, stimulants like caffeine, antidepressants such as carbamazepine, and antibiotics such as ciprofloxacin.The IIT Madras study showed that it was essential to regularly monitor rivers and their tributaries for contamination by pharmaceutical products.  There was also a need to upgrade wastewater treatment systems to reduce the levels of emerging contaminants in the rivers. This study has been carried out with joint funding from Water Technology Initiatives of the Department of Science and Technology, Government of India and the UK Natural Environment Research Council.The results of the study have recently been published in the reputed peer-reviewed journal Science of the Total Environment, in a paper co-authored by Jayakumar Renganathan, Insamam Ul Huq S., Kamaraj Ramakrishnan, Manthiram Karthik Ravichandran, and Dr Philip.Dr Philip said, “We monitored the water quality of Cauvery River for two years to assess the seasonal variation of emerging contaminants, especially pharmaceutically active compounds. The IIT Madras team collected water from 22 locations along the entire stretch of the river. We also set up 11 sampling stations near discharge points of partially treated or untreated wastewater, and 11 locations near intake points of water supply systems. The quality of water in the catchment sites was also monitored.”The study found that water quality and levels of pharmaceutical contaminants in the Cauvery are influenced by the monsoon season. The post-monsoon period showed an increased level of various types of contaminants, including pharmaceuticals, due to reduced riverine flow and continuous waste discharge from multiple sources. “The team’s environmental risk assessment has shown that pharmaceutical contaminants pose medium to high risk to the selected aquatic lifeforms of the riverine system,” said Dr Philip.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/environment/iit-madras-researchers-find-high-levels-of-pharmaceutical-contaminants-in-the-cauvery-river-7566231.html,Research,"This study has been carried out with joint funding from Water Technology Initiatives of the Department of Science and Technology, Government of India and the UK Natural Environment Research Council.The results of the study have recently been published in the reputed peer-reviewed journal Science of the Total Environment, in a paper co-authored by Jayakumar Renganathan, Insamam Ul Huq S., Kamaraj Ramakrishnan, Manthiram Karthik Ravichandran, and Dr Philip.Dr Philip said, “We monitored the water quality of Cauvery River for two years to assess the seasonal variation of emerging contaminants, especially pharmaceutically active compounds.The quality of water in the catchment sites was also monitored.”The study found that water quality and levels of pharmaceutical contaminants in the Cauvery are influenced by the monsoon season.","['Water Technology Initiatives', 'the Department of Science and Technology, Government of India', 'the UK Natural Environment Research Council', 'Science of the Total Environment']",[]
Apple appeals against security research firm while touting researchers,18 August,"Apple Inc on Tuesday appealed a copyright case it lost against security startup Corellium, which helps researchers examine programs like Apple’s planned new method for detecting child sex abuse images.A federal judge last year rejected Apple’s copyright claims against Corellium, which makes a simulated iPhone that researchers use to examine how the tightly restricted devices function.Security experts are among Corellium’s core customers, and the flaws they uncovered have been reported to Apple for cash bounties and used elsewhere, including by the FBI in cracking the phone of a mass shooter who killed several people in San Bernardino, California.Apple makes its software hard to examine, and the specialized research phones it offers to pre-selected experts come with a host of restrictions. The company declined to comment.The appeal came as a surprise because Apple had just settled other claims with Corellium relating to the Digitial Milennium Copyright Act, avoiding a trial.Experts said they were also surprised that Apple revived a fight against a major research tool provider just after arguing that researchers would provide a check on its controversial plan to scan customer devices.”Enough is enough,” said Corellium Chief Executive Amanda Gorton. ”Apple can’t pretend to hold itself accountable to the security research community while simultaneously trying to make that research illegal.”Under Apple’s plan announced earlier this month, software will automatically check photos slated for upload from phones or computers to iCloud online storage to see if they match digital identifiers of known child abuse images. If enough matches are found, Apple employees will look to make sure the images are illegal, then cancel the account and refer the user to law enforcement.”We’ll prevent abuse of these child safety mechanisms by relying on people bypassing our copy protection mechanisms,’ is a pretty internally incoherent argument,” tweeted David Thiel of the Stanford Internet Observatory.Because Apple has marketed itself as devoted to user privacy and other companies only scan content after it is stored online or shared, digital rights groups have objected to the plan.One of their main arguments has been that governments theoretically could force Apple to scan for prohibited political material as well, or to target a single user.In defending the program, Apple executives said researchers could verify the list of banned images and examine what data was sent to the company in order to keep it honest about what it was seeking and from whom.One executive said that such reviews made it better for privacy overall than would have been possible if the scanning occurred in Apple’s storage, where it keep the coding secret.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/world/apple-appeals-against-security-research-firm-while-touting-researchers-7353121.html,Research,"Apple Inc on Tuesday appealed a copyright case it lost against security startup Corellium, which helps researchers examine programs like Apple’s planned new method for detecting child sex abuse images.A federal judge last year rejected Apple’s copyright claims against Corellium, which makes a simulated iPhone that researchers use to examine how the tightly restricted devices function.Security experts are among Corellium’s core customers, and the flaws they uncovered have been reported to Apple for cash bounties and used elsewhere, including by the FBI in cracking the phone of a mass shooter who killed several people in San Bernardino, California.Apple makes its software hard to examine, and the specialized research phones it offers to pre-selected experts come with a host of restrictions.If enough matches are found, Apple employees will look to make sure the images are illegal, then cancel the account and refer the user to law enforcement.”We’ll prevent abuse of these child safety mechanisms by relying on people bypassing our copy protection mechanisms,’ is a pretty internally incoherent argument,” tweeted David Thiel of the Stanford Internet Observatory.Because Apple has marketed itself as devoted to user privacy and other companies only scan content after it is stored online or shared, digital rights groups have objected to the plan.One of their main arguments has been that governments theoretically could force Apple to scan for prohibited political material as well, or to target a single user.In defending the program, Apple executives said researchers could verify the list of banned images and examine what data was sent to the company in order to keep it honest about what it was seeking and from whom.One executive said that such reviews made it better for privacy overall than would have been possible if the scanning occurred in Apple’s storage, where it keep the coding secret.","['Apple Inc', 'Apple', 'Apple', 'Apple', 'FBI', 'Apple', 'Apple', 'the Stanford Internet Observatory', 'Apple', 'Apple', 'Apple', 'Apple']",[]
"Humans may live up to 150 years if accidents and fatal diseases are taken away, study says",27 May,"Immortality sure is a pipe dream but living close to one and half centuries may be a possibility for humans, new research has suggested.According to a report by Scientific American, researchers have been trying to find out how long humans can live if they do not contract any fatal disease, die in an accident, or anything else that cuts short our lives prematurely. They suggested that the maximum life span for human beings hovers somewhere between 120 and 150 years, considering the person goes through life with minimum stressors.No one can live longer than 150 years because the human body’s capacity to restore equilibrium to its many structural and metabolic systems wanes away with time. The research findings published in the journal Nature Communications on May 25, explained that even if obvious hazards do not take one’s life, the eventual loss of resilience does.Heather Whitson, Director, Center for the Study of Aging and Human Development, Duke University, said: “They are asking the question of ‘What’s the longest life that could be lived by a human complex system if everything else went really well, and it’s in a stressor-free environment?’ The team’s results point to an underlying pace of aging that sets the limits on lifespan.”How did the researchers arrive at the magic number of 150?Timothy Pyrkov, one of the researchers, studied the “pace of aging” in three large cohorts across three nations – the United States, the United Kingdom, and Russia. They keenly observed changes in blood cell count and the daily number of steps taken to find out deviations from stable health. This was then analysed separately for different age groups.The researchers found that due to factors beyond diseases, both blood cell count and step count suffered as age progressed.Pyrkov and his colleagues used this predictable pace of decline to find out when the body’s resilience can disappear completely and kill them person; they arrived at a range of 120 to 150 years.He said: “We observed a steep turn at about the age of 35 to 40 years that was quite surprising. For example, this period is often a time when an athlete’s sports career ends, an indication that something in physiology may really be changing at this age.”The researchers’ conclusion suggests that treating diseases will not be the answer to impeding the process of aging. Similarly, since biological processes of aging will continue no matter what, living a long life may mean living a frail life (after a point).",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/trends/health-trends/if-we-take-away-accidents-and-fatal-diseases-humans-may-live-up-to-150-years-study-6949201.html,Research,"The research findings published in the journal Nature Communications on May 25, explained that even if obvious hazards do not take one’s life, the eventual loss of resilience does.Heather Whitson, Director, Center for the Study of Aging and Human Development, Duke University, said: “They are asking the question of ‘What’s the longest life that could be lived by a human complex system if everything else went really well, and it’s in a stressor-free environment?’ The team’s results point to an underlying pace of aging that sets the limits on lifespan.”How did the researchers arrive at the magic number of 150?Timothy Pyrkov, one of the researchers, studied the “pace of aging” in three large cohorts across three nations – the United States, the United Kingdom, and Russia.This was then analysed separately for different age groups.The researchers found that due to factors beyond diseases, both blood cell count and step count suffered as age progressed.Pyrkov and his colleagues used this predictable pace of decline to find out when the body’s resilience can disappear completely and kill them person; they arrived at a range of 120 to 150 years.He said: “We observed a steep turn at about the age of 35 to 40 years that was quite surprising.",['Duke University'],[]

Govt restrictions to further weaken mobility to retail and recreation spaces: CRISIL,05 April,"The fresh round of government restrictions will further weaken mobility to retail and recreation spaces in more-affected states, particularly Maharashtra, according to rating agency CRISIL.At the all-India level, mobility to retail and recreation spaces remained relatively unaffected ever since the surge in cases began in mid-February, it said.According to CRISIL, the second wave of COVID-19 is spreading faster than the first with the daily cases crossing the previous peak of September 2020. It however noted that in the second wave, the fatality rate is lower.""While daily deaths have slowly begun to increase, incremental case fatality ratio is low at around 0.6 percent, compared with last year when, it was 1.3 percent, indicating that while the virus is spreading faster, the death toll is lower than last year,"" CRISIL said.The ratings agency further said that between March 29 - April 4, the daily cases shot up by 52 percent from  68,000 to over 1 lakh.""Initially concentrated in Maharashtra, new cases are slowly dispersing to other states, which have seen some dip in mobility towards end-March.

Test flight for sunlight-blocking research stands cancelled,03 April,"A test flight for researching ways to cool Earth by blocking sunlight will not take place as planned in June in Sweden, after objections from environmentalists, scientists, and Indigenous groups there.The Swedish Space Corp. said this week that it had canceled plans for the flight, in which it would have launched a high-altitude balloon, on behalf of researchers, from its facility in the Arctic. It would have been the first flight of Scopex, a long-planned experiment led by scientists at Harvard University.The corporation, which is owned by the government, said it had consulted “with both leading experts on geoengineering and with other stakeholders,” as well as with a Harvard committee that is advising the researchers. The decision not to conduct the test was made in agreement with the Harvard panel, it said.The advisory committee issued its own statement saying it recommended that any test flights be suspended until it “can make a final recommendation about those flights based on a robust and inclusive public engagement in Sweden.”Scopex is intended to better understand one form of solar geoengineering: injecting substances into the air to reflect some of the sun’s rays back to space and thus reduce global warming relatively quickly.Solar geoengineering has long been a subject of intense debate among scientists and policymakers, often seen as a desperate, potentially dangerous measure that could have unintended consequences for regional climates. Even conducting research on the subject has been viewed as harmful in that it could distract society from the goal of reducing emissions of planet-warming gases to avoid the worst effects of climate change.But there is a growing view among some scientists that, with the world not making nearly enough progress in reducing emissions, research in geoengineering is needed to learn more about how and whether it would work if pressure grew to use the technology. Last month, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, an influential scientific advisory body, called on the United States to spend at least $100 million on research.Solar geoengineering research currently involves computer simulations or experiments in a laboratory setting. Scopex, which stands for Stratospheric Controlled Perturbation Experiment, has been in development for years, and one of its primary goals is to provide real-world data to improve simulations.The planned first flight would not have involved injecting anything into the atmosphere. Instead, it would have tested the experimental setup, which includes large fans to create a short wake in the upper atmosphere. Such disturbed areas would be where injection experiments would take place in future flights.Concern about what might come later is what prompted objections in Sweden, said Niclas Hallstrom, who is with What Next, an environmental research group based in Uppsala.“The mobilization against this project in Sweden has been remarkable, uniting scientists, civil society and the Saami people, against the danger of a slippery slope toward normalization of a technology that is too dangerous to ever be deployed,” Hallstrom said.David Keith, a Harvard physicist involved with the project, said he doubted that anyone knew how widespread opposition was in Sweden. He said surveys in other countries, including some in those most affected by climate change, had shown support for geoengineering research.“Each time there has been real consultative process, all of those have suggested that public support for experiments like this is significant,” he said.The Scopex flight was originally planned to take place in the southwestern United States, but it was moved to Sweden last year because of contractor issues. As to whether the flight might now be moved back to the United States, “we’re certainly looking at that and other options,” Keith said.The Harvard advisory panel said that “societal engagement” should occur in Sweden before any Scopex research is conducted there and that it was working with specialists to begin the process. “This will likely postpone the platform launch until 2022,” the panel said.But Hallstrom said no amount of engagement would convince those opposed to the project that it should move ahead.Geoengineering research has inched forward in the United States in recent years. In 2019, Congress gave the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration $4 million to research the technology. Last year, a nonprofit organization called Silver Lining announced another $3 million in grants to Cornell University, the University of Washington and others for research.Kelly Wanser, executive director of Silver Lining, called the decision to cancel the test “an indication that purely private efforts are unlikely to work well” and evidence of the importance of government-run research.A previous attempt to conduct atmospheric research, a project called Spice — which had been scheduled to take place in Britain in 2012 — was canceled because of conflict-of-interest concerns involving some of the researchers. But the project also was the target of public opposition. Like the first Scopex flight, the Spice experiment was just a technical test of the equipment.(Author: Henry Fountain and Christopher Flavelle)/(c.2021 The New York Times Company)",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/world/test-flight-for-sunlight-blocking-research-stands-cancelled-6726231.html,Research,"The decision not to conduct the test was made in agreement with the Harvard panel, it said.The advisory committee issued its own statement saying it recommended that any test flights be suspended until it “can make a final recommendation about those flights based on a robust and inclusive public engagement in Sweden.”Scopex is intended to better understand one form of solar geoengineering: injecting substances into the air to reflect some of the sun’s rays back to space and thus reduce global warming relatively quickly.Solar geoengineering has long been a subject of intense debate among scientists and policymakers, often seen as a desperate, potentially dangerous measure that could have unintended consequences for regional climates.Last year, a nonprofit organization called Silver Lining announced another $3 million in grants to Cornell University, the University of Washington and others for research.Kelly Wanser, executive director of Silver Lining, called the decision to cancel the test “an indication that purely private efforts are unlikely to work well” and evidence of the importance of government-run research.A previous attempt to conduct atmospheric research, a project called Spice — which had been scheduled to take place in Britain in 2012 — was canceled because of conflict-of-interest concerns involving some of the researchers.","['Harvard', 'Silver Lining', 'Cornell University', 'the University of Washington', 'Silver Lining', 'Spice']","['at least $100 million', '$4 million', '$3 million']"
India investing themes for 2021 Part 2: Housing – an evergreen theme,24 December,"                        The housing segment has been a constant focus of every government, but despite that housing in India is far from adequate. The government has accordingly made “Housing for All by 2022” a priority and is doing its best to boost housing growth.

From fastest vaccine ever to hidden lakes on Mars: Here are the top science moments of 2020,19 December,"The most thrilling and most keenly observed scientific achievement of the year 2020 has to be the development of the coronavirus vaccine. However, that does not dim the shine of the other breakthrough discoveries and scientific moments that this year has witnessed – right from the discovery of hidden lakes on Mars to scientists finding out that there may be millions of potential habitable planets in the universe. Let us take a look at some more of such incredible scientific discoveries and achievements made in 2020.COVID-19 research and vaccine: In a span of less than 12 months, coronavirus researchers have been able to sequence the novel coronavirus’ genome, understand the nature of the infection and how it affects the human body, and even developed COVID-19 vaccines that are now being administered across a host of nations. This was the first time ever in the history of mankind that a vaccine was developed this fast.Hidden lakes on Mars: Scientists believe the presence of water has a direct correlation with habitability. On that note, we come to another remarkable scientific discovery made in 2020 – three hidden lakes on Mars. This means, even though the red Planet looks uninhabitable, it might actually have supported life. The three lakes that were buried under the surface of Mars are spread over 75,000 square kilometres approximately – that would be as large as a small country.Another Martian discovery would be evidence confirming that water was present on Mars much before we thought it was – which is around 4.4 billion years ago.New organ discovered in human body: Researchers in The Netherlands accidentally discovered a new organ in the human body. They chanced upon a set of salivary glands that were hitherto unknown. These went unnoticed for years as they are deep set in the upper part of the throat.COVID-19 VaccineFrequently Asked QuestionsA vaccine works by mimicking a natural infection. A vaccine not only induces immune response to protect people from any future COVID-19 infection, but also helps quickly build herd immunity to put an end to the pandemic. Herd immunity occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population becomes immune to a disease, making the spread of disease from person to person unlikely. The good news is that SARS-CoV-2 virus has been fairly stable, which increases the viability of a vaccine.There are broadly four types of vaccine — one, a vaccine based on the whole virus (this could be either inactivated, or an attenuated [weakened] virus vaccine); two, a non-replicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of SARS-CoV; three, nucleic-acid vaccines that have genetic material like DNA and RNA of antigens like spike protein given to a person, helping  human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine; and four, protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombinant proteins of SARS-COV-2 along with an adjuvant (booster) is given as a vaccine.Vaccine development is a long, complex process. Unlike drugs that are given to people with a diseased, vaccines are given to healthy people and also vulnerable sections such as children, pregnant women and the elderly. So rigorous tests are compulsory. History says that the fastest time it took to develop a vaccine is five years, but it usually takes double or sometimes triple that time.Closest ever images of the Sun: US space agency NASA and the European Space Agency launched the Solar Orbiter in February 2020, which sent back the closest images ever taken of the Sun. For the first time, these images showed how miniature solar flares are always burning everywhere on the surface of the Sun.300 million habitable planets in Milky Way alone: Research revealed almost half of the Sun-like stars in the Milky Way galaxy could have habitable planets in their solar systems. Which means there could be almost 300 million habitable planets inside our galaxy alone. Meanwhile, another study revealed that there are 24 planets that may be more habitable than Earth.

DeepMind AI solves 50-year old medical science problem of mapping protein structure,01 December,"An artificial intelligence company called DeepMind has built an AI system that found a breakthrough to a grand challenge in Biology which hindered medical advancement and disease fighting mechanisms from progressing.DeepMind, the company that had become famous for designing computers that could defeat humans at games, has been able to solve a 50-year-old science problem, which will help make huge advancement in the field of biology.Fifty years ago, scientists had said that a protein’s structure could be predicted by learning its sequence of amino acids. However, it remained a challenge for scientists for all these years because there are literally innumerable ways in which the same protein could fold to take on a 3D structure.DeepMind’s AI system can swiftly and accurately predict how proteins fold into 3D formations, which scientists were unable to figure until now. According to a report by the Independent, the AI system could drastically change our fight against diseases – ranging from coronavirus to cancer.DeepMind developed the pathbreaking AI project with the 14th Community Wide Experiment on the Critical Assessment of Techniques for Protein Structure Prediction (CASP14). CASP was formed 25 years ago by a group of scientists to hold international competitions wherein various methods of predicting protein structure would be compared for eventual medical advancement.Figuring out a protein’s structure or what is commonly referred to as protein folding, used to take years of laborious experimentation, and even so, they were not accurate. However, AlphaFold – the AI system created by Google’s DeepMind, will be able to accurately predict a protein’s structure and map its three-dimensional shapes in only a few hours.Since the outbreak of the novel coronavirus pandemic, we have been hearing how a “spike in protein” on the virus allows it to bind and invade human cells. Such complex processes among others take place because the amino acids in protein molecules – which are essentially a string of chemical compounds -- fold in intricate ways to create unique shapes that decide how the protein will behave.Dr John Moult, chair of CASP14, said: “Even tiny rearrangements of these vital molecules can have catastrophic effects on our health, so one of the most efficient ways to understand disease and find new treatments is to study the proteins involved.”",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/science/deepmind-ai-solves-decades-old-medical-science-problem-of-mapping-protein-structure-6176601.html,Research,"An artificial intelligence company called DeepMind has built an AI system that found a breakthrough to a grand challenge in Biology which hindered medical advancement and disease fighting mechanisms from progressing.DeepMind, the company that had become famous for designing computers that could defeat humans at games, has been able to solve a 50-year-old science problem, which will help make huge advancement in the field of biology.Fifty years ago, scientists had said that a protein’s structure could be predicted by learning its sequence of amino acids.Such complex processes among others take place because the amino acids in protein molecules – which are essentially a string of chemical compounds -- fold in intricate ways to create unique shapes that decide how the protein will behave.Dr John Moult, chair of CASP14, said: “Even tiny rearrangements of these vital molecules can have catastrophic effects on our health, so one of the most efficient ways to understand disease and find new treatments is to study the proteins involved.”",['AI'],[]
Is the recovery here to surprise us quarter after quarter?,30 November,"Highlights- GDP springs a positive surprise after better-than-expected corporate earnings - Overall top line growth of India Inc in line with demand picture reflected in GDP data - Q2 corporate earnings picture had benefits of moratorium and SC standstill on NPAs - Cost optimization key driver of Q2 profitability - Extreme cost control might crimp demand and drag future growth - If companies revert to near pre-COVID expenses, then earnings surprise could be limited - Q2 has by far been the biggest surprise and is unlikely to be repeatedEarly indications of a post-lockdown revival came from the September quarter numbers of Corporate India. Directionally, it is corroborated by the gross domestic product (GDP) data for Q2 FY21. Silencing the naysayers, the real GDP decline of 7.5 percent was much above the consensus forecast.The positive contribution of agriculture (YoY growth of 3.4 percent) was on expected lines. The surprises included: the marginal growth in manufacturing (0.6 percent), and the lower-than-expected decline in construction (at – 8.6 percent in Q2 against -50.3 percent in Q1) and the trade, hotels, transport and communication segments (decline of 15.6 percent in Q2 compared to 47 percent in Q1).Although India has entered a technical recession with two consecutive quarters of GDP decline (Q1 FY21 fell 23.9 percent), there are reasons to be optimistic.The expenditure break-up of GDP suggests that other than government expenditure, which was 78 percent of last year’s level, and imports (83 percent of last year’s level and a positive from GDP perspective), other components such as private expenditure, investments and exports are a whisker away from pre-COVID levels.Also Read | 'Q2 GDP looks much better but no guarantee of improvement unless government spends more'Explained | GDP data: What two successive quarters of contraction implyBudget 2021-22: Here's how you can share your ideas with governmentQ2 GDP shows surprising resilience: Is it good enough to last?In the absence of large volumes of disaggregate data points it is difficult to comment on the sustainability of the trend. However, we turn to the latest quarterly earnings report of listed companies to check the ground reality of the quarter and draw cues on the sustainability of this revival.The weakness in government expenditure is reflected in the bulging receivables of companies dependent on government orders. However, with tax collections showing positive traction, these companies are expecting government expenditure to normalise in the second half.What about the not-so-bad expenditure picture of GDP?Source: Moneycontrol ResearchThe analysis of India Inc’s top line performance over the last two quarters clearly shows an across-the-board recovery, irrespective of the sizes of companies. The YoY decline in sales of 6.2 percent on an aggregate basis is broadly in line with the 7.7 percent fall in private expenditure in the GDP data. If the momentum continues, sales will likely see growth in the second half.The moratorium – the joker in the pack so farHowever, there are certain stand-out features of the Q2 numbers that merit attention. The July-September 2020 quarter was one that had the benefit of the moratorium. This might have helped some smaller companies. For instance, while the absolute interest payment of all listed companies as well as the companies belonging to the Nifty index was more or less flat, for smaller companies represented by the BSE Small Cap index there was a YoY decline in interest expenses by over 8 percent. This could have been because of the moratorium benefit.The moratorium till the end of August followed by the Supreme Court’s standstill on asset classification resulted in no deterioration in asset quality for financial sector firms amid the overall weak economy. Savvy players have used the windfall to shore up provisions. On an overall basis, this had a significant positive impact on the banking sector’s profitability.In Q3, the benefits of the moratorium would not exist. This could impact numbers, especially for financials and some stressed companies.Extreme cost optimisation & its consequencesIndia Inc has cut down costs to the hilt in the September quarter. Even with a benign performance on top line and no great benefit of operating leverage, the number of companies that have reported a year-on-year improvement in operating margins is mind boggling. While softer input costs had some role to play, a greater contribution came from rationalisation of headcount as well as employee remuneration alongside stringent control over all discretionary expenses.Source: Moneycontrol ResearchFor the overall universe of listed companies, 58 percent companies reported an improvement in operating margin. For Nifty companies, this was a whopping 74 percent.Why this level of cost optimization may not be good newsFirstly, cost optimization of this magnitude is bound to impact fortunes of certain sectors in terms of lower purchasing power that could be a probable drag on GDP.This could also inhibit a meaningful revival in corporate earnings, if demand remains lacklustre. On the other hand, with a gradual return of normalcy, if companies revert to close to pre-pandemic cost structures, then earnings surprise could be limited.Hence, a surprise of the magnitude seen in Q2 might not repeat itself although the quarters ahead could see a further return to normalcy - GDP growth limping back to positive territory and corporate earnings gaining traction.

Scientists find 24 planets that are more habitable than Earth,07 October,"Scientists have discovered 24 planets that have conditions more suitable to support life than the Earth. These 24 “superhabitable” planets can support complex life forms better than the Earth and have stars that are better than the Sun.A study led by Washington State University scientist Dirk Schulze-Makuch and recently published in the journal Astrobiology has identified planets that were older than the Earth, slightly larger, warmer, and wetter too. As per the observations of the research team, life could thrive more easily on these superhabitable planets that orbit slowly changing stars that would live longer than our Sun.All  24 planets identified by the scientists are located more than 100 light years away from our planet. It would be difficult to see them up close right away, but the findings of the study could guide future telescope observations.Commenting on the research findings, Professor Dirk Schulze-Makuch said: “With the next space telescopes coming up, we will get more information, so it is important to select some targets. We have to focus on certain planets that have the most promising conditions for complex life.”Astronomers had devised a superhabitability criteria based on which 4,500 known exoplanets were studied. The habitability criteria do not entail exhibiting signs of life. Instead, the prerequisite is availability of necessary conditions to support complex life forms.To arrive at the 24 superhabitable planets, the research team studied systems with G stars that have a short lifespan of less than 10 billion years (such as our Sun) and systems with K dwarf stars, that are far smaller and cooler and have long life span up to 70 billion years.The research team searched for planets that are 10 percent bigger than the Earth as those would have more habitable land, while having greater mass would mean the planet would be able to retain its interior heating for longer. Moreover, this would also guarantee stronger gravity.Water was another characteristic that the research team was on the lookout for alongside higher surface temperatures.Although none of the 24 planets met all the criteria of superhabitability, there was one that met four of the key characteristics. This means living on that planet would be more comfortable than living on Earth.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/science/scientists-find-24-planets-that-are-more-habitable-than-earth-5934831.html,Research,"These 24 “superhabitable” planets can support complex life forms better than the Earth and have stars that are better than the Sun.A study led by Washington State University scientist Dirk Schulze-Makuch and recently published in the journal Astrobiology has identified planets that were older than the Earth, slightly larger, warmer, and wetter too.Instead, the prerequisite is availability of necessary conditions to support complex life forms.To arrive at the 24 superhabitable planets, the research team studied systems with G stars that have a short lifespan of less than 10 billion years (such as our Sun) and systems with K dwarf stars, that are far smaller and cooler and have long life span up to 70 billion years.The research team searched for planets that are 10 percent bigger than the Earth as those would have more habitable land, while having greater mass would mean the planet would be able to retain its interior heating for longer.","['Sun', 'Washington State University', 'Astrobiology', 'Sun']","['less than 10 billion years', 'up to 70 billion']"
People who laugh more may be better at dealing with stress,08 August,"New European research has found that people who laugh more during stressful times appear to show less symptoms of stress.Carried out by researchers at the University of Basel, the new study looked at 41 students (of whom 33 were women) with an average age of 21.The participants were followed for a period of 14 days, during which time they were asked to answer questions eight times a day on a mobile phone which asked them about the frequency and intensity of laughter, their reason for laughing, and any stressful events or physical and psychological stress symptoms that they experienced throughout the day, such as ""I had a headache"" or ""I felt restless.""The first thing that the researchers found, which was expected based on the current evidence, is that when the participants laughed frequently, any stressful events they experienced at the time were associated with more minor symptoms of stress. Moreover, the more frequently they laughed close to the time of experiencing stressful events, the weaker the link between the stressful events and stress symptoms became.However, the team was surprised to find that when it came to the intensity of the laughter, defined as strong, medium, or weak, there was no statistically significant correlation with symptoms of stress.""This could be because people are better at estimating the frequency of their laughter, rather than its intensity, over the last few hours,"" the researchers said.They added that the findings, published in the journal PLOS ONE, suggest that people who laugh frequently in their everyday lives may be better able to deal with stressful events.Previous studies have also shown that laughter can bring various health benefits. A US study published back in 2011 by the University of Maryland School of Medicine showed that watching a funny film can improve vascular function, while a UK study published the same year found that genuine belly laughter, rather than forced laughter or a small giggle, can help relieve pain. As well as physical benefits, laughing together can also release the ""feel-good"" chemicals endorphins in the brain and promote social bonds between people, according to a 2017 study by researchers at the University of Turku, Finland.Researchers have estimated that people typically laugh 18 times a day, mostly when they are with other people.

How old is Moon? Earth's only natural satellite is 85 million years younger than previously thought,17 July,"A research team of planetary geophysicists led by Maxime Maurice of the German Aerospace Center and researchers at the University of Münster has recently devised a new numerical model to accurately calculate the age of the Moon – the Earth’s only natural satellite.The German scientists have revealed that the Moon was formed a little later than we had known until now. The satellite was formed when a protoplanet as large as Mars was destroyed after it collided with the Earth. As a result of the clash, debris was ejected into space, one of which eventually turned into the Earth’s satellite.This phenomenon took place 4.425 billion years ago.

COVID-19: Treat universities as an essential service,03 June,"A few days back, the guidelines for Lockdown 5.0 or Unlock 1.0 were out. Although most activities are now allowed, decision about educational institutions will be taken only in July. They were the first to be closed and perhaps will be last to be opened.There seems to be a misplaced perception that university education is all about only classroom teaching. Most leading universities in the world are in the forefront of fight against COVID-19. They are involved in treatment and vaccination research as well as pandemic modelling. In addition, serious research work is being produced on economic and social implications of the pandemic. By now we are familiar with the John Hopkins Coronavirus Research Center, the vaccine development at Oxford, treatment research at Peking, modelling research at Cambridge, etc. The Harvard Medical School, the Imperial College London and many others are contributing significantly to improve our understanding about the virus.Apart from few exceptions, contribution from Indian universities is limited. Many of them have not gone beyond advising washing hands, maintaining social distance, downloading Aarogya Setu and providing links to the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare. In fighting the pandemic and its long-term effects, India must use the strength of its close to 1,000 universities, 40,000 colleges and 1000-plus stand-alone institutions of higher learning.Teaching in specialised higher education institutions is different from school teaching. Although limited online teaching is possible, it can never substitute live, in-person teaching. We will be dishonest if we start pretending that university teaching is continuing in India through the online mode. It is understandable that at the peak of the pandemic classroom teaching was not possible. However, now with the opening of malls and religious places, the argument that educational institutions need to remain close is no longer valid.Unused ResourcesCOVID-19 VaccineFrequently Asked QuestionsA vaccine works by mimicking a natural infection. A vaccine not only induces immune response to protect people from any future COVID-19 infection, but also helps quickly build herd immunity to put an end to the pandemic. Herd immunity occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population becomes immune to a disease, making the spread of disease from person to person unlikely. The good news is that SARS-CoV-2 virus has been fairly stable, which increases the viability of a vaccine.There are broadly four types of vaccine — one, a vaccine based on the whole virus (this could be either inactivated, or an attenuated [weakened] virus vaccine); two, a non-replicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of SARS-CoV; three, nucleic-acid vaccines that have genetic material like DNA and RNA of antigens like spike protein given to a person, helping  human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine; and four, protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombinant proteins of SARS-COV-2 along with an adjuvant (booster) is given as a vaccine.Vaccine development is a long, complex process. Unlike drugs that are given to people with a diseased, vaccines are given to healthy people and also vulnerable sections such as children, pregnant women and the elderly. So rigorous tests are compulsory. History says that the fastest time it took to develop a vaccine is five years, but it usually takes double or sometimes triple that time.Apart from teaching, however, universities are supposed to be involved in fundamental research. With most labs and all departments closed, university research in India is crippled. Apart from the bare minimum administrative work, most universities offices are non-functional. This is affecting implementation of existing research projects and preparation of new proposals. These activities are crucial for university profile and finances.Why are still university campuses treated like containment zones? Shouldn’t faculty, and even researchers, be given access to college/university resources, such as Internet and library, which are better than personal connections? Large scale online activities such as webinars, etc. could be better managed if the university departments are open. The University Grants Commission has issued some guidelines, and depending on prevailing situation in different cities, universities are free to work out their own approach to teaching, modes of examination, timetable, etc. Rather than ad-hoc decision being taken, opening up of university departments and offices will help proper procedures to be followed while deciding on crucial matters.COVID-19 ResearchThe teaching load in universities is not expected to be high in the coming weeks or months — this is because it will take time for a relative equilibrium to set in. This time can be dedicated towards COVID-19-related research in different fields. We definitely need medical research. By now it is clear that we also need extensive new research on national/global economic and political implications; migration-related issues, poverty as well as social and other aspects of the pandemic. Agriculture and political administration are areas that needs focus as well.The past few months has generated a huge amount of national and international data related to the pandemic. Only a fraction of this data has been analysed so far. Careful, independent analysis of this data may provide us with many new policy options.This is not to say that no research is being done. Independent, individual research is underway during the lockdowns, but this is only a fraction of the potential. An institutional environment, with the infrastructure it provides, will help academia and research perform better.Except for classroom teaching, where social distancing norms cannot be effectively followed, most western universities have been functioning during the pandemic. In India, except some notional online teaching, almost everything else is closed. The time has come rethink our approach towards higher education institutions.Except for a serious medical breakthrough, it’s fair to say that by July there isn’t going to be a drastic change from where we are now. Given this, we might as well quickly adapt to the new normal.Gulshan Sachdeva is Chairperson, Centre for European Studies at Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi.

"Coronavirus pandemic | DRDO builds contactless UVC sanitiser for currency notes, cellphones, laptops",11 May,"In a development that could help in India’s fight against the coronavirus pandemic outbreak, the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) has developed a contact-less sanitizer that can be used to disinfect currency notes, laptops, cell phones, etc.The Hyderabad-based Research Centre Imarat (RCI) -- a premiere laboratory under the DRDO – developed the UVC sanitation cabinet that has been named Defence Research Ultraviolet Sanitiser or DRUVS.For live updates on coronavirus, click hereThe machine will help disinfect items such as cheques, iPads, envelopes, receipts, and paper, apart from the aforementioned items that are otherwise difficult to sanitise. Narayana Murthy, Director, RCI, confirmed that the deadly novel coronavirus, which has been wreaking havoc across the world, can easily be killed with this machine since it has just one layer of protein.As per an India Today report, the device was built by a team of researchers including senior scientist Gopinath and his colleague Sourav Kumar. They built it in less than 15 days and after conducting validation tests, two of the machines were sent to the Virology laboratory in Hyderabad, where it was virtually inaugurated by Defence Minister Rajnath Singh.COVID-19 VaccineFrequently Asked QuestionsA vaccine works by mimicking a natural infection.

Reliance Industries Q3FY19 – Petchem and retail drive the show,05 February,"Ruchi Agrawal | Sachin Pal | Krishna KarwaMoneycontrol Research Highlights Petchem business drives strong topline expansion in Q3FY19Degrowth in GRMs in line with global weaknessJio posts healthy growth despite slowdown in customer additions and ARPURetail continues hyper growth --------------------------------------------------Reliance Industries (RIL) reported a healthy Q3FY19 with mixed performance across verticals. Petchem and retail fared well, and refining was weak in line with global trends. Jio's overall performance was good, but customer addition and average revenue per customer (ARPU) growth slowed.Key Positives-Petrochemical segment's topline grew 37 percent YoY, with higher realisation and improved volumes in fibre intermediates and polymer products.-Weakness in the polymer margins was offset by strong polyester margins during the quarter.-Gross refining margins at $8.8/bbl were $0.7/bbl lower compared to the preceding quarter due to weak crude oil prices, in line with the global weakness in GRMs. Still, GRMs were substantially above the global Singapore benchmark, indicating a healthy inventory management during the quarter.-Refining business saw a healthy volume growth.-Jio revenues topped Rs 10,000 crore, up 12 percent QoQ. Operating profits improved on higher margins with expanding customer base (280 million).-Despite strong competition, Jio posted a solid growth in subscriber base (up 11 percent QoQ) though there was a slight reduction in churn rate.-Retail segment revenues nearly doubled YoY, driven by healthy festive season sales and rapid store additions. Higher operating leverage lifted margins by 160 basis points YoY.-Media business saw a healthy 23 percent YoY growth on improved advertising revenue, profits in movie production and healthy growth in subscription income. Strong performance in regional channels and operating leverage drove the segment’s profitability.Key Negatives -Interest cost nearly doubled YoY primarily due to higher borrowings for petchem projects and digital services. Jio’s interest costs spiked nearly 9 percent QoQ. However, the increase in finance costs was lower compared to growth in revenue and operating profits.-High fuel prices, higher production, and expanding network expenses led to a noticeable expansion in other expenses.-Upstream oil and gas business continued to be an overhang on profits.-While Jio’s subscriber base continued to expand, the pace of the growth moderated primarily due to base effect and increased competition.-Discounts and offers (to protect as well as gain market share) kept the ARPU of all industry players under pressure and Jio’s ARPU witnessed a marginal decline.OutlookRIL is steadily moving from a commodity driven business to a more consumer oriented business which we believe would aid a rerating for the stock. With the full commissioning of the petchem units, we expect great vertical integration and higher margins for the petrochemical business which is already witnessing increasing demand and posting aggressive growth.Reliance retail and Jio are now at the core focus for expansion and are expected to drive the revenue growth in the coming quarters.Jio’s strategy of deeper and wider market penetration would continue to disrupt the entire value chain. The company is planning to make further inroads through various strategic tie-ups and partnerships (Disney, DEN, Hathaway) and roll-out of new services (JioGigaFiber).Aggressive store additions, improved customer engagement and strong distribution network will drive rapid expansion in the retail segment. Impetus towards operational efficiencies, expansion of margin-accretive private label brands and economies of scale should help improve profitability of the segment in the coming quarters.The company has key ingredients to emerge an integrated telecom, retail and energy giant on the back of its strong financials, execution capabilities, spare capacity and the huge unmet potential available in India.Disclaimer: Reliance Industries Ltd. is the sole beneficiary of Independent Media Trust which controls Network18 Media & Investments Ltd.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/earnings/reliance-industries-q3fy19-petchem-and-retail-drive-the-show-3405491.html,Research,"However, the increase in finance costs was lower compared to growth in revenue and operating profits.-High fuel prices, higher production, and expanding network expenses led to a noticeable expansion in other expenses.-Upstream oil and gas business continued to be an overhang on profits.-While Jio’s subscriber base continued to expand, the pace of the growth moderated primarily due to base effect and increased competition.-Discounts and offers (to protect as well as gain market share) kept the ARPU of all industry players under pressure and Jio’s ARPU witnessed a marginal decline.OutlookRIL is steadily moving from a commodity driven business to a more consumer oriented business which we believe would aid a rerating for the stock.With the full commissioning of the petchem units, we expect great vertical integration and higher margins for the petrochemical business which is already witnessing increasing demand and posting aggressive growth.Reliance retail and Jio are now at the core focus for expansion and are expected to drive the revenue growth in the coming quarters.Jio’s strategy of deeper and wider market penetration would continue to disrupt the entire value chain.","['ARPU', 'ARPU']","['8.8', '0.7']"
"Cloud computing tops list of emerging risks, reveals Gartner survey",17 September,"By Matthew ShinkmanCloud computing is growing in popularity and has become a solution for issues that have plagued organisations and overtaxed IT departments for years.In fact, the number of cloud managed service providers is predicted to triple by 2020. While executives are keen to expand into cloud services and make them an integral part of their digital business initiatives, there aresome concerns.Risk executives are eyeing emerging risks around the chances of unauthorised access to sensitive or restricted information — or the possibility that the cloud provider won’t be able to provide access to information as a result of disruption in their own operations.Extreme financial and reputational damage has yet to occur as a result of cloud computing failures, but the possibility worries risk executives nevertheless.Despite the advantages, cloud computing comes with added vulnerability if data is stored incorrectly or if the provider’s own security is compromised.To mitigate these risks, executives will need to guarantee that their cloud security strategy keeps up with the pace of this growth.Recent regulatory changes, such as GDPR, and growing scrutiny at the board level about cybersecurity mean the risks associated with what has become a standard business practice are on the rise.Cloud risks are an emerging concernEvery quarter, Gartner surveys senior risk executives at leading organisations to identify the top risks to their companies that are new and unforeseen and whose potential for harm or loss is not yet fully known or has yet to rise to an area of significant concern.If a risk appears in four consecutive quarters, it is no longer considered ""emerging"" so is removed from the risk list.In the latest Emerging Risks Report and Monitor, the majority of risk executives reported being most concerned about the probability and impact of potential data risks associated with cloud computing.To properly vet whether cloud computing presents a risk and better inform security decisions, risk executives should be especially alert to the following key risk indicators: Rising proportion of data stored in the cloud Changes in product offerings or contract terms from cloud provider(s)Growing percentage of non-cloud provider third parties with access to data in the cloudUnauthorised employee usage of cloud servicesThe latest report, which surveyed 110 global executives, also found the following emerging risk events to be of the greatest concern to senior risk executives:1.

"Reliance Industries results review: Another quarter of robust growth in petchem, Jio",27 July,"Ruchi Agrawal | Nitin Agrawal | Krishna KarwaMoneycontrol ResearchReliance Industries (RIL) reported healthy numbers for the June quarter, led by strong performance in the petchem, Jio and retail segments. Refining margins were soft, in line with global trends, but record volumes in the petrochemical segment more than compensated for it. Retail too saw yet another quarter of robust growth.Jio continued to post strong revenue growth, along with an improvement in operating profitability during the quarter.Segment wise performancePetrochemicals – record performance Petchem segment reported record earnings with a 58 percent year-on-year (YoY) increase in realizations and a stellar 95 percent YoY uptick in profitability. Margins improved 370 basis points YoY. The strong performance was driven by 1) robust 35 percent increase in volumes 2) improved realization with uptick in crude 3) commissioning and stabilization of the refinery of gas cracker unit (ROGC) and its downstream units 4) improved polyester margins 5) stable polymer margins 6) rapid growth in domestic demand for petchem products 7) globally improving product pricesRefining – lower refining margin in line with global trendRefining contributes more than two third of the group’s revenues. Performance was slightly tepid during the quarter with gross refining margins (GRM) at $10.5 per  barrel (bbl) (Q1FY18: $11.9/bbl). However, the softness was in line with weak global GRMs, but a good $4.5/bbl above the Singapore benchmark margins. While revenue increased 43 percent YoY, earnings before interest and taxes (excluding exceptional items) declined 17 percent due to 1) weakness in gross refining margins 2) lower crude throughput 3) adverse movement in Brent-Dubai differentials 4) weak gasoline prices due to higher inventory across the globe and higher exports from China due to low internal growth.Retail downstream oil business reported strong growth during the quarter with 25 percent YoY increase in gasoline volumes. The company now plans to re-commission fuel outlets in order to drive further volume growth.Oil and Gas – earning erosion continuesThe upstream oil and gas segment saw improved realization with an 8 percent YoY growth in revenue due to rapid uptick in the oil and gas prices globally. However with declining volumes in both domestic (down 11.8 percent) and US shale (down 26.6 percent), the segment EBIT continued to be negative. Incremental production from the CBM block neutralized the dip in production from the KG D6 basin. The company now plans to start monetizing its KG D6 block and drilling work has started in July.Retail – expanding rapidlyRapid store expansion, coupled with improved customer engagement processes across all segment, helped the retail segments top-line grow 123 percent YoY during the quarter, despite a high base last year. Margins improved 160 basis points led by emphasis on cost control initiatives and benefits of operating leverage owing to additional stores. Fashion - Aggressive store expansion, loyalty programmes, tie-ups with leading foreign apparel brands, foray into the mothercare category, online sales (through AJIO), and higher contribution of private labels should help RR consolidate its strengths better.Grocery – The quarter saw robust growth across all sub-segments (home and personal care, staples, fruits, vegetables). We believe improved brand visibility with store additions will attract more footfalls and increase volumes.Reliance Digital – The company plans to undertake integration of its existing 305 physical digital stores with new ‘Jio Points’ and ‘Reliance ResQ’ (the service arm) centres which would help further widen the customer base in the upcoming quarters.Jio – continues capturing the marketJio’s operating revenues revenue rose 13.8 percent YoY to Rs 8,109 crore (up 13.8 percent quarter-on-quarter). The division added 28.7 million net subscribers over the last quarter, expanding the subscriber base to 215.3 million at the end of June 2017. Jio achieved a subscriber base of 200 million within 21 months of starting operations.Despite strong competition, Jio’s ARPU (average revenue per user) witnessed a marginal dip of 1.9 percent QoQ. (Airtel posted a decline of 9.5 percent).Jio’s EBITDA margins expanded 100 bps to 38.8 percent, a commendable achievement. This was helped by a reduction in access charges (net), which fell from 15 percent of revenues from operations to 13 percent in this quarter (Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) cut interconnection usage charge (IUC) by 57 percent effective 1 October 2017).Outlook Post the end of an aggressive capex cycle, RIL is now in a sweet spot. Most of its projects are in the monetization phase, and this will boost cash flows in quarter ahead, in turn improving operating efficiencies.

Opinion | Are Indian markets prepared to deal with increasing global stress to the economy?,25 July,"A falling rupee indicates a clear and present danger for India from increasing global stress. The local currency has fallen 7% versus the US dollar since the beginning of January.External risks at present form the soft underbelly of the Indian economy. Rising crude oil prices, a worsening current account deficit, and a slowdown in foreign investment inflows threaten to upend the economic recovery. In its 7 June statement, the Reserve Bank of India’s rate setting panel highlighted “geo-political risks, global financial market volatility and the threat of trade protectionism” as key threats. These pressures have emerged to the fore in recent months as can be seen from the depreciation in emerging market currencies.As the US and EU end a decade of easy monetary policy and the former pursues an expansionary fiscal policy at the same time, some of the risks are expected to worsen. Indeed, in its review of the US economy presented on 14 June, the International Monetary Fund said that “a rapid rise in inflationary pressures would force the Federal Reserve to move at a faster pace than is currently priced in by markets.” The US Fed has already increased rates twice this year and signaled that two more are coming.Any more rate increases could increase global volatility, reverse capital flows to emerging market and worsen global imbalances. Indeed, some of this is already happening. RBI governor Urjit Patel wrote in a 3 June op-ed in the Financial Times last week, the outflows from emerging markets exceeded $5 billion a week over the past few weeks. India has been no stranger to these outflows. Foreign investors have net bought around half a billion dollars’ worth of equities so far in 2018; but withdrawn about $5 billion from bonds during the same period.This is happening at a time, when rising crude oil prices are putting more pressure on the current account deficit. JP Morgan estimates that if oil prices were to sustain at $75 a barrel this financial year, current account deficit would hit $80 billion or close to 3% of gross domestic product (GDP). Already trade deficit in the first two months of this fiscal year has climbed to $28.3 billion. In theory, a depreciating rupee is supposed to help exports, but may not be enough to boost overseas sales and reduce the trade deficit.Not only is there a danger of the deficit widening, funding it is going to be a challenge. Foreign direct investment (FDI) was not enough to cover financial year 2017-18’s current account gap of $48.7 billion, and nor  is it likely to do so in the current fiscal. The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) in a 6 June report has projected FDI inflows into south Asia to remain stagnant or decline in 2018. So, there will be an increasing reliance on fickle portfolio flows at a time of increasing US rates.The good news is that India is in a much stronger position than it was during the so-called “taper tantrum” of 2013 when the rupee crashed after the US Fed signaled its intent to wind down bond purchases. Indicators such as the current account deficit, foreign exchange reserves, fiscal deficit and inflation are all better than at the time of the taper tantrum.But policymakers would do well to monitor the increasing risks. Inflation is already on the upswing leading the RBI to hike rates for the first time in four years last week. A depreciating rupee will feed into inflation, but there is no alternative other than letting the currency weaken, and to hike rates.In this context, it is important that the government doesn’t stray from the path of fiscal prudence – tempted as it may be in an election year – and endanger macroeconomic stability.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/opinion/are-indian-markets-prepared-to-deal-with-increasing-global-stress-to-the-economy-2595031.html,Research,"These pressures have emerged to the fore in recent months as can be seen from the depreciation in emerging market currencies.As the US and EU end a decade of easy monetary policy and the former pursues an expansionary fiscal policy at the same time, some of the risks are expected to worsen.Indeed, in its review of the US economy presented on 14 June, the International Monetary Fund said that “a rapid rise in inflationary pressures would force the Federal Reserve to move at a faster pace than is currently priced in by markets.” The US Fed has already increased rates twice this year and signaled that two more are coming.Any more rate increases could increase global volatility, reverse capital flows to emerging market and worsen global imbalances.","['EU', 'the International Monetary Fund', 'the Federal Reserve', 'The US Fed']","['$5 billion', 'around half a billion dollars', 'about $5 billion', '75', '$80 billion', '$28.3 billion', '$48.7 billion']"
"COMMENT - Don’t let MSCI arm-twist India, but yield to Singapore exchange on GIFT partnership",01 June,"Shishir AsthanaMoneycontrol ResearchThe Morgan Stanley Capital International (MSCI) has jumped into a fight it should have kept out of. The company, which is one of the biggest index compilers with nearly $9 trillion riding on the indices it generates, is now trying to lean on emerging countries like India for market access.On Wednesday MSCI said it was placing Indian and Brazilian markets on notice for limiting investor access. The weights of India and Brazil markets could be capped on MSCI Indexes. The company also said countries like Turkey, South Korea, India, and Brazil restrict the use of local data in derivatives created by offshore exchanges. India, additionally, was faulted for a lengthy and burdensome mandatory registration process for foreign investors.There is no doubt that the second part of the argument is true, as the registration process is never-ending.However, as for market access, there are a number of issues involved here. Foreigners prefer to trade in rival exchanges mainly because of the cost of doing business. Take Singapore’s SGX for instance. First, investors get to trade in dollars, second, they pay lower taxes, and finally, the cost of transacting in India is much higher than in Singapore. Multiple layers of taxes by the central and state government plus the high cost of trading imposed by the exchanges themselves are prohibitive for high volume trades. SGX clearly scores over Indian exchanges when it comes to the cost of doing business.But when it comes to limiting investor access, MSCI is way off target. The issue that MSCI has raised is the ongoing tussle between National Stock Exchange (NSE) and SGX where the latter uses NSE’s Nifty index to trade for 16 hours in a day, well after Indian markets have closed.SGX Nifty is amongst the most traded futures contract on the SGX. However, many a time there is little or no synchrony between the two markets. Take for example on the day when Indian exchanges decided to cut all ties with the Singapore Exchange, the SGX Nifty fell by nearly 8.8 percent at the start of the day, the most it did since November 2008; however, the Nifty did not move in lock-step, suggesting that no arbitrage was happening.As there is no underlying instrument in SGX it’s only traders who are attracted to the exchange. Investors, who deal in buying and holding stocks will not be keen in trading in SGX. Arbitrage opportunity, if at all will be possible only when both the exchanges are open simultaneously.SGX is fine with this arrangement and is keen on only attracting speculative volume, or what is normally known as hot money. The exchange now wants to introduce stock futures on its own. As most of the volume in NSE is also in derivatives it is naturally disturbed by SGX entering in its territory. SGX wants to introduce the derivative contracts of stocks without paying NSE any fee.To rub it in, the new index that SGX is planning to launch is a clone of Nifty. Reports say that SGX is considering allowing its SGX Nifty traders to roll over their position to the new index seamlessly after its contract with NSE expires in August. Normally there cannot be shifting of position from one instrument to another.Perhaps MSCI sees an opportunity here to work with SGX and promote its own index. But MSCI is clearly coming on too strongly in the name of ‘limiting market access’. Indian exchanges allow shares of Indian companies listed abroad to be converted into Indian ones and traded domestically, after all.MSCI’s Emerging Market Index has nearly $88 billion tracking it. India with its 8.3 percent weight has nearly $7.3 billion at stake. Many passive funds invest by using the 79 stocks MSCI India Index.MSCI never complained of limited access all these years. But now it sees an opportunity is getting a derivative index traded without allowing its investors to take the currency risk. But in doing so it is setting a wrong precedent.MSCI Chief Executive Officer Henry Fernandez is quoted as saying “It is expected that stock exchanges, which often have legal or natural monopolies, should not impose clauses in their provision of stock market data. The existence of these types of practices will lead to a negative assessment.”In essence what the MSCI is trying to say is that it should be allowed to use the derivative data of any company and use it to be traded in any exchange. If it is not allowed to do so it will arm-twist the countries to fall in line with a threat of reducing their weight.Access to economies should be seamless but cherry-picking financial instruments, that too derivative instruments is not helping the economies where the shares are listed. The companies whose derivatives are listed abroad do not benefit, either. The entire exercise just expands the casino.India’s response should be to ignore the MSCI threat and focus on promoting the Gujarat International Finance Tec City (GIFT) where the NSE should relax its position and enter into a partnership with SGX. It would provide SGX its data, allow trade in dollars and make more money than it would by doing it on its own, thanks to the clients that SGX brings in.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/moneycontrol-research/comment-dont-let-msci-arm-twist-india-but-yield-to-singapore-exchange-on-gift-partnership-2580469.html,Research,"Take for example on the day when Indian exchanges decided to cut all ties with the Singapore Exchange, the SGX Nifty fell by nearly 8.8 percent at the start of the day, the most it did since November 2008; however, the Nifty did not move in lock-step, suggesting that no arbitrage was happening.As there is no underlying instrument in SGX it’s only traders who are attracted to the exchange.The existence of these types of practices will lead to a negative assessment.”In essence what the MSCI is trying to say is that it should be allowed to use the derivative data of any company and use it to be traded in any exchange.","['the Singapore Exchange', 'the SGX Nifty', 'Nifty']","['nearly $9 trillion', 'nearly $88 billion', 'nearly $7.3 billion']"
Logistics sector outlook: Long and exciting road ahead,09 May,"Sachin PalMoneycontrol ResearchThe logistics sector has been in limelight in the past couple of years and is undergoing a significant transformation on account of various reform initiatives and policy changes. The major reforms include the introduction of GST (goods & service tax), roll out of E-Way bill and the sector being granted infrastructure status. The initial benefits of these developments have started coming in but majority would accrue in the coming years. In this backdrop, it may be worth checking out the stock that investors should look at to ride the emerging tailwind in the sector.Sectoral reforms to drive efficiencies and benefit organised playersThe introduction of Goods and Services Tax (GST) in July last year has ushered in an architectural change in the logistics sector and simplified the state-wise differential tax structure with a uniform single lower tax. The new tax regime would also drive operating efficiencies as the time spend to pay octroi duty, border checks could now be used to move goods further.In November 2017, the government granted infrastructure status to logistics sector (including cold chain and warehousing facilities). The grant of infrastructure status will allow the logistics companies get access to more economical loans under favourable terms. The industry expects to gain around 25-50 bps in terms of funding cost from this development.The introduction of E-Way bill (electronic documentation aimed to track goods movement and prevent tax evasion under GST) from 1 April 2018 would result in increased transparency as well as encourage further formalisation of the sector.These changes are likely to reduce the cost of logistics in India which currently stands around 13-14% of GDP, which is significantly higher than countries such as US (9.5%) and Germany (8%). The reforms and developments also marks a step in the right direction as government has already indicated its plans to bring down the logistics cost to around 10% of GDP.Sector set for a healthy runIn light of the recent developments and changes, the sector looks set to grow at a healthy rate. According to research firm CRISIL, the Indian logistics industry that was estimated at Rs 6.4 trillion in FY17 is forecasted to reach Rs 9.2 trillion by FY20 representing a CAGR of 13% driven by growth across all segments.Within the logistics segment, Third-Party Logistics (3PL), a service that allows a business to outsource operational logistics from warehousing to delivery, is expected to grow the fastest. As per CRISIL estimates, the 3PL market in India stood at Rs 32,500-33,500 crore in FY17 and is expected to grow at a CAGR of 19-21% to reach Rs 57,000-58,000 crore by FY20.In terms of mode of transportation, road remains the most preferred medium for transport, although it is relatively expensive compared to rail. The growth and efficiencies in road transport (~65% of the sector) will be supported by recent government initiatives such as Bharatmala and Smart Cities.Growth in E Commerce which requires a faster turnaround time is another key driver for express delivery companies which mainly operate in  the road segment.Physical warehouses becoming passéThe removal of tax boundaries across states would aid the consolidation of warehouses as logistics companies are increasingly focusing on the hub and spoke model.They are increasingly employing a pool of large trucks and other vehicles which act as a mobile warehouse to serve a wider area. This trend is gaining traction as it eliminates the need for capital-intensive physical warehouses and allows the players to serve their clientele with more flexible and moving fleet.However, strategically located warehouses along with specialised warehouses providing customised storage solutions (temperature/climate controlled, Bulk Storage etc.) will continue to flourish as we don’t see any replacement for them.How are the companies placed?We looked at the companies operating in the sector on multiple parameters such as their business model, historical financial performance, strength of their balance sheet, operating metrics etc. to understand their business performance.Container transportation operators, Concor and Gateway Distriparks have witnessed low single digit volume growth and have seen their margins decline due to cost pressures.VRL Logistics has a unique business model and has reported a healthy bottomline growth in 9M FY18.Allcargo has posted decent performance but its capital intensive business weighs on the Return on Equity (RoE).Third Party Logistic (3PL) operator Mahindra Logistics (ML) has the highest asset turnover ratio of 3.8x but operates on very low net profit margins (NPM).Express delivery operators Bluedart and Gati have been witnessing stiff competition from private players, which is the major reason for their sluggish profitability growth during FY14-FY17. Also, their debt to equity ratio remains at elevated levels.Future Supply Chain (FSC) has seen a big surge in profits (on account of a small base). However, its asset turnover and return ratios remains moderate despite being a third party logistics operator.Our preferred pick – TCI ExpressAmongst the listed companies in the sector, TCI Express (TCIX, price: Rs 477, Market Cap: Rs 1826 crore) remains our preferred pick in the sector considering future growth, business model, financial profile and current valuations.TCIX, the demerged express distribution business of Transport Corporation of India, operates in the surface express, domestic air express, international air express, and reverse express segments though a vendor network of 4000+ containerised trucks, 550 branches and 28 sorting centres. While majority of the sorting centres are leased, it owns around 9 sorting centres at strategic locations and plans to develop sorting centres at various strategic locations.The management plans to grow its business organically and has chalked out a capex plan of Rs 400 crore (over 5 years) to drive future growth.The development of road and highways under the Bharatmala Pariyojana will be a big boost for TCIX as it primarily operates in the road segment.Despite the hiccups faced due to GST in the Q1 and Q2 of FY18, the company remains on track to deliver topline growth of 18-20% in FY18.Going forward, we expect the company to post a topline growth of 15%+ in FY19 aided by industry tailwinds.  A slower than expected pick-up in the industrial growth as well as execution challenges related to recent changes (introduction of E-Way bill etc.) remains the key investment risks.We expect, the net profit growth to be much higher (25 %+) on account of high operating leverage and cost savings resulting from recent changes in its distribution strategy. Investors with a medium to long term view should look to accumulate this stock post the recent correction in the markets.For more research articles, visit our Moneycontrol Research Page.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/moneycontrol-research/logistics-sector-outlook-long-and-exciting-road-ahead-2542993.html,Research,"The growth and efficiencies in road transport (~65% of the sector) will be supported by recent government initiatives such as Bharatmala and Smart Cities.Growth in E Commerce which requires a faster turnaround time is another key driver for express delivery companies which mainly operate in  the road segment.Physical warehouses becoming passéThe removal of tax boundaries across states would aid the consolidation of warehouses as logistics companies are increasingly focusing on the hub and spoke model.They are increasingly employing a pool of large trucks and other vehicles which act as a mobile warehouse to serve a wider area.While majority of the sorting centres are leased, it owns around 9 sorting centres at strategic locations and plans to develop sorting centres at various strategic locations.The management plans to grow its business organically and has chalked out a capex plan of Rs 400 crore (over 5 years) to drive future growth.The development of road and highways under the Bharatmala Pariyojana will be a big boost for TCIX as it primarily operates in the road segment.Despite the hiccups faced due to GST in the Q1 and Q2 of FY18, the company remains on track to deliver topline growth of 18-20% in FY18.Going forward, we expect the company to post a topline growth of 15%+ in FY19 aided by industry tailwinds.",['FY18'],[]
"Ruchi Soya deal to boost Godrej Agrovet's palm oil business, dilute EPS in short run",05 April,"Ruchi Agrawal Moneycontrol ResearchPost the announcement of plans to enter the bidding race for Ruchi Soya, which is undergoing insolvency resolution process under NCLT, the shares of Godrej Agrovet (GAL) saw an upward movement last month.GAL is not the first and many eminent companies, both domestic and international have expressed interest to acquire the debt laden company. More than 25 companies are in the race to bid for Ruchi Soya, including some renowned names like Emami, Patanjali, ITC, etc.GAL has already expressed intent to bid for a stake in Ruchi Soya, however it is mainly interested in the palm oil segment of the company which forms around 12 to 14 per cent of the total business of Ruchi Soya. It is also looking for other companies who might be interested in forming a consortium and bid together.Update on Ruchi SoyaRuchi Soya is India’s largest edible oil extraction company with a capacity of 3.72 million tonnes per annum of which around 0.9 Million metric tonne accounts for palm oil extraction. It has more than 2 lac hectares of oil palm land under cultivation across India. Revenue from the total refined oil business forms almost 74 per cent of the total revenues of Ruchi Soya.As of 30 September 2017, borrowings stood at around Rs 6000 crore with total debt of Rs 12000 crore and cash of Rs 90 crore on its balance sheet. Last year, it announced a 51 per cent stake sale to private equity major Devonshire Capital for about Rs 4,000 crore. However, with the NCLT admitting its case under the corporate insolvency resolution, the Devonshire deal could not close.What’s in it for AgrovetGodrej Agrovet has a diversified business and is the largest player in the oil palm segment in India. Palm oil segment forms around 13 per cent of Agrovet’s topline and was in fact the major revenue and profit driver in Q3FY18. GAL has a rapidly growing presence in the palm oil business in India and abroad with around 61,700 hectares of land under palm oil cultivation. The company has been the major beneficiary of the recent import duties on palm and refined oil which stand to give the company a competitive edge over imports and boost its domestic presence and penetration.GAL has a healthy balance sheet with minimal debt and a debt to equity ratio of around 0.15x. The company has had a keen eye on expanding its business through the inorganic route and Ruchi Soya happens to be available at the right time.The palm oil business of Ruchi Soya would help GAL rapidly expand its own palm oil segment both domestically and in international markets. It would give GAL access to ready network and markets which would facilitate expansion.Deal financials and outlookAccording to Ruchi Soya, the current bids hover in the range of Rs 8000-10000 crore, which appears to be on a higher side. The management expects that here would be an estimated 30-40 per cent haircut taken by various banks in the deal. This would reduce the debt to around Rs 4,000 crore approximately and would lead to interest cost saving of Rs 500-550 crore for the company. The interest cost would fall from Rs 830 crore to around Rs 250 crore post this deal. However, deal valuation seem very high and we need to wait and watch before some clarity emerges on the same.Although the exact silhouettes of the proposal are not available but assuming Agrovet leads the race, and finances the deal through debt, this would lead to substantial deterioration of the debt to equity ratio.However, since GAL is explicitly interested only in the palm oil business which forms only around 12 to 14 per cent of the Ruchi Soya’s business, we expect it to bid in a consortium or collaboration between various bidding companies and thereby we see limited financial burden on GAL.Although GAL is keenly interested in the palm oil business, we highly doubt any cow boyish move by the company and expect the balance sheet sanctity to remain even post the deal. Given the low leverage currently, GAL is in a good position to raise debt. A certain finance cost would enter the company’s accounts which would reduce the interest cover. The deal could be EPS dilutive in the short run.In the longer term, we see substantial synergies with GAL acquiring access to the established palm oil plantations and network of Ruchi Soya. It would facilitate rapid expansion for GAL’s palm oil segment. It would also help GAL leverage the current positive stance for the domestic palm oil production and export segment.Follow @RuchiagrawalFor more research articles, visit our Moneycontrol Research Page.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/opinion/ruchi-soya-deal-to-boost-godrej-agrovets-palm-oil-business-dilute-eps-in-short-run-2542375.html,Research,"More than 25 companies are in the race to bid for Ruchi Soya, including some renowned names like Emami, Patanjali, ITC, etc.GAL has already expressed intent to bid for a stake in Ruchi Soya, however it is mainly interested in the palm oil segment of the company which forms around 12 to 14 per cent of the total business of Ruchi Soya.However, deal valuation seem very high and we need to wait and watch before some clarity emerges on the same.Although the exact silhouettes of the proposal are not available but assuming Agrovet leads the race, and finances the deal through debt, this would lead to substantial deterioration of the debt to equity ratio.However, since GAL is explicitly interested only in the palm oil business which forms only around 12 to 14 per cent of the Ruchi Soya’s business, we expect it to bid in a consortium or collaboration between various bidding companies and thereby we see limited financial burden on GAL.Although GAL is keenly interested in the palm oil business, we highly doubt any cow boyish move by the company and expect the balance sheet sanctity to remain even post the deal.","['Patanjali', 'ITC', 'the Ruchi Soya’s']","['51 per cent', '13 per cent']"
Ideas for Profit: Acrysil – Dissecting the hidden small cap,04 April,"Jitendra Kumar GuptaMoneycontrol ResearchAcrysil (Market Price: Rs 589,Market Cap: Rs 305), whose share price remained flat over the last 3-4 years, is finally finding some serious buyers. Taking advantage of overall weakness in the market, ace investor Ashish Kacholia has bought 4.3% stake from Everest Finance And Investment Company.Incorporated about three decades ago, Acrysil, which seems to be quite aware of this underperformance, is silently building capabilities. The company in its latest annual report quoted “Success and growth are not achieved easily. It takes time, dedication sacrifice and a lot of forces working together. The most important ingredient for success and growth is a strong foundation”.Making a strong foundationAcrysil, a niche player in the growing consumer space, has a strong brand identity and manufacturing capabilities supported by its German partner Schock & Co, a leading decorative moulding company. Under its well-known brand “CARYSIL”, the company manufactures granite sinks, stainless sinks and other kitchen products like dish washers and refrigeration equipment for the residential and professions customers.The company has clearly defined its strategy to expand dealer network (1000 dealers), brand building and expand product range. The company’s advertising and sales promotion expenses have increased five-fold since fiscal 2013. It recently diversified its products and segments to stainless steel kitchen sinks, trading of kitchen appliances and bath segments. It is leveraging its brand and started focusing on appliance business, which it intend to grow from Rs 15 crore in FY17 to Rs 100 crore over the next five years.Last year in 2017, it introduced highest number (25) of new products. In terms of markets, it is also looking to increase its global footprint to 70 nations globally in order to leverage its brand and shore up its exports revenue. It intends to expand organically and through acquisitions as well. It has already made few acquisitions in the international markets to gain foothold.Back ended growth Apart from the product and market diversification, the company recently raised its installed capacity from 3,25,000 sinks per annum to close to 4,00,000 sinks. Benefit of this expansion would be seen in the coming quarters with the improving housing market both at home and abroad.Moreover sink and kitchen appliances market, particularly the product categories in which the company is operating, is a highly unorganised underpenetrated market. As the general income levels grow and benefits of macro factors like growing working population, nuclear family culture etc. start playing out, these categories would be the big beneficiaries.Over the last five and ten year period, the company has compounded its sales at 24-25% annually. In FY10, the company had a sales turnover of about Rs 47 crore, which till FY17 rose to Rs 187 crore. This is still small.Will the company be able to scale?At least the intent is there with the strong grip on managing risk. During most of the years, it has kept its debt to equity below or around 1 times, which is quite reasonable for a growing company.“At Acrysil, we are confident that we are at the cusp of high growth and all round successful period. We are extremely motivated and poised towards achieving our short term growth milestone of Rs 300 crore revenue, medium term of growth milestone of Rs 500 crore revenue and long term growth milestone of Rs 1000 crore revenue”ValuationsDespite correction in the overall market and crack in the mid and small cap space, Acrysil has held its share prices with the stock currently trading at Rs 585 a share discounting 23 times its annualised FY18 earnings.

Auto March 2018 sales review – CV and tractors segment continues to zoom,03 April,"Nitin AgrawalMoneycontrol Research Auto players continued to clock strong growth in sales volume in the month of March 2018. Segment-wise performance continued to be robust for commercial vehicle (CV) and tractors on the back of good monsoon, improved rural sentiments and increased production of BS-IV compliant vehicles. Additionally, there has been a revival in three-wheeler sales following government’s decision to end Permit Raj, and a pick-up in exports on the back of improving global climate.Focus on rural economy in an election year and continued investment in infrastructure should boost CV and tractor segments going forward. Stronger numbers from two-wheeler companies is an early trend and could get some additional support if the revival of rural economy gathers momentum in the coming months.Commercial Vehicle (CV) – Strong showThe commercial sector has bounced back strongly after initial disruption from demonetisation and the BS-IV transition affected the transport industry last year.Notably, LCV segment has also started showing strong uptrend in monthly numbers due to increased thrust on agriculture, FMCG and e-commerce sectors and increasing demand coming for container and refrigerated trucks.Tata Motors registered a significant growth on the back of increasing demand from construction, growing logistics, e-commerce and FMCG applications. The M&HCV truck segment continued to be robust on the back of stringent restrictions on overloading, replacement buying and various infrastructure projects. Demand for higher tonnage trucks and tippers continues to be good.M&M posted a healthy growth thanks to good monsoon, and rural penetration of the company. The management expects the growth momentum to continue on the back of some recent refresh launches as well as the better performance of its product portfolio. The management is particularly buoyed by the growth of its truck business, which has outperformed the industry.Eicher Volvo also witnessed a significant growth of 30.4 percent (YoY) in the month. Ashok Leyland also continued to post strong growth (20 percent YoY).Cars Segment – leader continued its mojoThe leader, Maruti, continued to top the charts in PV (Passenger Vehicle) segment with 15 percent growth, mainly driven by 24.3 percent growth in UV (Utility Vehicle) segment.For Tata Motors, passenger car segment witnessed a decline of 4 percent (YoY) whereas its UV segment trebled, thanks to the strong demand for its Nexon, a compact SUV.Initial signs of revival are visible in the numbers of M&M as well and it posted a growth of 4 percent (YoY). With three new automotive launches lined up in FY19, the management is confident of increasing companies’ market share in the utility vehicle space.Two-wheeler (2W) segment: TVS is gaining momentumIn the two-wheeler space, Eicher witnessed strong sales of bikes below 350cc with a growth of 18.8 percent (YoY) and bikes above 350cc segment witnessed a significant increase mainly because of the lower base of last year.TVS continues to post a strong growth in the two-wheeler segment primarily because of 40.5 percent growth in bikes and 20 percent growth in scooters. Bajaj’s domestic business witnessed muted growth in March 2018.Hero, yet again, achieved highest-ever monthly sales and posted a significant growth of 20 percent in the month.Three-wheeler (3W): Bajaj leadsThe overall three-wheeler market continued to gain strength as is evident from the sales number for the March month.

COMMENT- Why diesel prices are at all-time high while oil prices are at half their peak level,03 April,"Shishir AsthanaMoneycontrol ResearchA record high diesel price means different things to different people. For the consumer, it’s obviously a reason to worry. For the government, it’s one more problem to add to a growing list, so much so that the superstitious among its supporters may see several signs that its four-year run of luck has ended. And for the opposition, whose voice is growing louder by the day, it’s a godsent opportunity to corner Prime Minister Narendra Modi.However, what is intriguing is that the diesel price has touched its highest point ever even as crude oil trades at less than half its peak price. Crude oil prices are currently at $70 a barrel as compared to $147 a barrel in 2008. Even allowing for a sharp fall in the dollar since then, this should not translate into the kind of diesel price increase we have seen.Part of the reason for diesel prices touching a new high is a domestic phenomenon. In most part of the world, diesel prices are nowhere close to the highs. In India, nearly 50 per cent of the amount paid by the consumer for diesel and petrol goes back to the state and central government as taxes.In order to increase his tax collection finance minister Arun Jaitley increased taxes on diesel and petrol nine times between November 2014 and January 2016. The entire benefit of low oil prices went to the government by way of higher taxes. The government needed the boost to make up for the shortfall on account of lower tax collections which were affected by demonetisation and GST (Goods and Service Tax).Petrol & Diesel Rates YesterdayWednesday, 29th March, 2023Petrol Rate in Mumbai YesterdayWednesday, 29th March, 2023Diesel Rate in Mumbai YesterdayHowever, now that oil prices have started to rise, the finance minister is reluctant to cut taxes as taxes from other sources have not yet picked up. In October 2017, the government did cut taxes by Rs 2 per litre which meant that it had to forego nearly Rs 26,000 crore in tax collection. This was done at a time when diesel touched Rs 70 per litre mark. This time however, no government action is visible.The government had scored some brownie points by asking state governments to do their bit in cutting taxes. Only four BJP-ruled states have reduced taxes, while others, including many BJP-ruled states have continued with their tax structure.But the tax is not the only reason behind higher diesel prices. Diesel prices globally have moved higher but at a much faster pace than oil prices. This rise has more to do with diesel’s own supply-demand issues.In India, a pickup in the economy has resulted in demand growth in diesel. Analysts expect diesel growth in the calendar year 2018 to be double that of 2017. Apart from the growing economy fuelling demand, diesel consumption is known to increase during election years. On top of this, supply been constrained. Two of India’s refineries, in Haryana and Gujarat, have been shut down for nearly two months for maintenance.Post-peak winter season, many refineries in the USA and Europe have also shut down for maintenance. As a result of this, inventories globally have declined. Diesel inventory which had been severely impacted by the dual hurricanes in the US, could not completely recover. The rising demand in the US itself and shutdowns of refineries have resulted in diesel inventory being at a 15 percent discount to the five-year average.While the diesel dynamics in the US was fragile, Europe increased its import from the US as Russian exports to Europe fell, which only added to the supply-demand mismatch.This is expected to continue till the refineries come on stream. There is enough refining capacity globally to meet the rise in demand for diesel. But the rise can continue if oil prices continue to rise.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/moneycontrol-research/comment-why-diesel-prices-are-at-all-time-high-while-oil-prices-are-at-half-their-peak-level-2541595.html,Research,"The government needed the boost to make up for the shortfall on account of lower tax collections which were affected by demonetisation and GST (Goods and Service Tax).Petrol & Diesel Rates YesterdayWednesday, 29th March, 2023Petrol Rate in Mumbai YesterdayWednesday, 29th March, 2023Diesel Rate in Mumbai YesterdayHowever, now that oil prices have started to rise, the finance minister is reluctant to cut taxes as taxes from other sources have not yet picked up.The rising demand in the US itself and shutdowns of refineries have resulted in diesel inventory being at a 15 percent discount to the five-year average.While the diesel dynamics in the US was fragile, Europe increased its import from the US as Russian exports to Europe fell, which only added to the supply-demand mismatch.This is expected to continue till the refineries come on stream.",[],"['70', '147']"
Aster DM Healthcare IPO – can give it a miss,12 February,"Ruchi AgrawalMoneycontrol ResearchThe IPO of Aster DM Healthcare opens an option to invest in an emerging healthcare chain in India, which has a substantial presence in GCC countries. The integrated healthcare provider has exposure in various healthcare segments like hospitals, clinics and pharmacies. The company is positioned to benefit from the positive outlook for healthcare post the budgetary announcements and allocations in India in the longer term.However, we see numerous risks associated with both operational and geographic uncertainties which the company is exposed to. The company has started the restructuring and remodeling process but any benefits are yet to flow in. It comes with a high leverage on the balance sheet along with low returns and low margins due to operating issues in key geographies. The issue stands fully priced in which leaves little on the table for the investors, limiting any near term upside.The company –Incorporated in 2008, Aster Healthcare is a private healthcare provider operating in GCC states (Gulf Cooperation Council) like UAE, Oman, Arabia, Qatar, Kuwait, Bahrain, Jordan, and is expanding its presence in India and Philippines. The company's Indian operations are headquartered in Kochi. It is headed by Dr. Azad Moopen, the promoter, chairman and managing director of the company.IPO Details –What we like about Aster - Strong presence in GCC countries – Aster has a strong brand presence in the GCC countries and is positioned to benefit from the expected growth in the healthcare segment due to an early mover advantage in those regions. Further, the presence of pharmacies at multiple locations across various GCC states also enhances the visibility of the company’s brands. Given the majority revenues flow in from middle-east, Aster enjoys a high ARPOB (average revenue per operating bed), much higher than that of Indian peers.Rapid growth – Aster has rapidly grown from 149 operating facilities in 5 countries in FY13 to 323 operating facilities in 9 countries in 1HFY18. The bed capacity increased manifolds from 1419 beds in FY13 to 4754 beds in FY17. During the same period the ARPOB (average revenue per operating bed) increased at a CAGR of 9 percent in GCC countries and 29 percent in India. The topline has grown by almost 24 percent in the last 4 years.What makes us cautious on the IPO -Highly levered balance sheet – With rapid expansion the company has accumulated high debt on its balance sheet. Even post the IPO and the scheduled repayment, the debt equity ratio does not fall substantially. The high leverage would limit the company’s expansion capabilities in the future.Low margin and low return ratios – Aster has built the aggressive topline expansion at a high cost and at low margins. At 5.7 % the operating margins are substantially lower than other well-known listed peers. Moreover, less than 1 percent ROCE (return of capital employed) is a cause of caution. The net profits have been negative in the last two years along with the current years 1H.High exposure to GCC states – More than 80 percent of the revenue flow in from GCC countries where the regulatory environment for ownership and business remains strict and stringent. The company is exposed to high risk arising from any changes in the regulatory structure in these countries.Benefits of restructuring not yet flowing in – During the past years the company had to take one time hit on revenues owing to unforeseen risks in the GCC countries like Saudi Arabia. Post these, the management has strategically shifted the business model to reduce dependency on government. However the benefits of the change in business model are yet to flow in.Future growth positioned in relatively lower ARPOB regions – Over the past years the company has enjoyed high ARPOB given majority revenues were coming from the Gulf countries. However, in the coming years the company plans to focus expansion in India where the ARPOBs are relatively lower. So in the long term they are positioned for a lower average ARPOB.Peer analysis and valuationThe company has shown aggressive topline growth compared to peers over the last few years. However, the same has not reflected in the profitability. At the upper price band of 190 the issue is priced at an EV/EBITDA of 37x which is considerably above the average peer multiple of established brands at 23x. The debt equity ratio at 1.5x is also substantially higher than that of its listed peers and even after the planned debt repayment from the issue proceeds the is no significant reduction in the debt equity profile. This is a point of caution and the fixed costs suppress the return ratios.Given the stretched valuation, multiple operating and geographical risks, along with high debt and a low returns and margin profile, we feel there is little on the table for he investors from the current issue and this IPO can be given a miss.Follow @RuchiagrawalFor more research articles, visit our Moneycontrol Research Page.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/opinion/aster-dm-healthcare-ipo-can-give-it-a-miss-2505879.html,Research,"It is headed by Dr. Azad Moopen, the promoter, chairman and managing director of the company.IPO Details –What we like about Aster - Strong presence in GCC countries – Aster has a strong brand presence in the GCC countries and is positioned to benefit from the expected growth in the healthcare segment due to an early mover advantage in those regions.The company is exposed to high risk arising from any changes in the regulatory structure in these countries.Benefits of restructuring not yet flowing in – During the past years the company had to take one time hit on revenues owing to unforeseen risks in the GCC countries like Saudi Arabia.","['IPO Details', 'GCC', 'GCC', 'GCC']",[]
"Note ban may have affected Current Account Deficit, says SBI Research",26 March,"SBI Research has attributed the lower outward remittances and massive jump in travel receipts, which bumped up the December quarter CAD, to the note ban impact that dominated the review period.""There are two distinct trends in the current account deficit (CAD) data print -- lower outward remittances and higher travel receipts -- and this could be attributed to note ban,"" SBI Research said in a weekend note.The upward revision in services exports is one of the main reasons in containing CAD, says the report.The rise in services export is mainly due to a rise in net travel balances, which grew by a massive 146 per cent to USD 2,476 million in Q3, when the demonetisation was announced, it said.The increase in net travel balances can be largely attributed to 73 per cent quarter-on-quarter growth in personal travel, it further said.""Net travel has registered the incremental increase of USD 1,469 million in the quarter, which is an all-time high (at least since 2000-01),"" the report said.""We believe, people travelling to the country during this time may have bought in more dollars/old currencies, thereby getting reflected in travel receipts during this period,"" it said.On demonetisation causing lower outward remittances, the report said outflows through the liberalised remittance scheme (LRS) that was showing a steep jump in the beginning of 2016 and possibly leading to a decline in domestic deposits, is now tapering off sharply.Interestingly, in the note ban quarter, the growth rate of inward remittance slipped to 56 per cent from a high of 342 per cent in the preceding quarter.""Now, whether this is due to increased apprehension on the part of public regarding tighter norms for unaccounted money or something else is entirely a matter of debate and conjecture,"" the report said.""But the fact is, this may have resulted in lower remittances abroad and possibly an increase in domestic deposits,"" it said.The CAD stood at USD 7.9 billion (1.4 per cent of GDP) in the third quarter of FY17, up than USD 3.4 billion (0.6 per cent of GDP) in the preceding quarter.But in percentage terms, it was stagnant at 1.4 per cent in the year ago period, and was up by USD 800 million in absolute terms.The less-than expected widening of CAD has burnished the rupee's strength after an increase in the US interest rates, the report said adding that ""the strong CAD data can support the rupee in the short-term.""The CAD is likely to be within limits of 1-1.5 per cent in FY19 too, it said.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/economy/note-ban-may-have-affected-current-account-deficit-says-sbi-research-2247115.html,Research,"""There are two distinct trends in the current account deficit (CAD) data print -- lower outward remittances and higher travel receipts -- and this could be attributed to note ban,"" SBI Research said in a weekend note.The upward revision in services exports is one of the main reasons in containing CAD, says the report.The rise in services export is mainly due to a rise in net travel balances, which grew by a massive 146 per cent to USD 2,476 million in Q3, when the demonetisation was announced, it said.The increase in net travel balances can be largely attributed to 73 per cent quarter-on-quarter growth in personal travel, it further said.""But the fact is, this may have resulted in lower remittances abroad and possibly an increase in domestic deposits,"" it said.The CAD stood at USD 7.9 billion (1.4 per cent of GDP) in the third quarter of FY17, up than USD 3.4 billion (0.6 per cent of GDP) in the preceding quarter.But in percentage terms, it was stagnant at 1.4 per cent in the year ago period, and was up by USD 800 million in absolute terms.The less-than expected widening of CAD has burnished the rupee's strength after an increase in the US interest rates, the report said adding that ""the strong CAD data can support the rupee in the short-term.","['CAD', 'SBI Research', 'CAD', 'CAD', 'CAD', 'CAD']","['146 per cent', '73 per cent', 'USD 1,469 million', '56 per cent', '342 per cent', 'USD 7.9 billion', '1.4 per cent', '0.6 per cent', '1.4 per cent']"

Are developers neglecting research on buyers needs?,18 January,"‘Location, location and location’ has been the tried-and-tested format of success in Indian real estate, so far. It has been the best calling card for all developers. Many even assumed that if a developer has land in a highly desirable location, then that in itself is enough to sell the project. However, the current slowdown in the real estate industry, has just forced them to wonder why another developer in the same market is successfully selling at a higher price point while their own project is heading nowhere. The answer lies in a single word – research, or the lack of it. Take the case of a builder who has abandoned his housing project in one of the most desirable locations of south Delhi. The said developer borrowed heavily to buy an 800-sq yard park-facing corner plot in West End for Rs 90 crores three years back. He was forced to abandon the apartment project and put the plot on the block after failing to find takers. Analysts point out that the same builder would have sold the apartments even at the drawing board stage, had he read the pulse of the market right. Anish Shah, director, Amal Realtors, however, believes that in certain locations, it is true that land competence itself is enough to sell. He cites the example of Mumbai where the biggest difficulty is the procurement of land. In Mumbai, land is enough to sell your project. “In Mumbai any developer is ready to pick up any land. The project is planned keeping in mind the kind of demand that particular land will induce,” points out Shah. “Accordingly, it’s decided whether it should be a residential or commercial or IT project. However, when it comes to the outskirt areas – the MMR region, Thane or western suburbs beyond Virar, the demand is uncertain,” says Shah. Sandeep Ahuja, CEO, Richa Realty, candidly admits that the developers have been carried away by land competence for the past several decades. The have neglected research about demand. “In the same Mumbai micro-market, one developer with a better product is able to sell more and reach more people, than a developer who has not focused on the research. The developers have been ignoring it but I think now, they won’t be able to do so anymore,” explains Ahuja. See also: Is there enough market research for home buyers? Another instance is Noida, where analysts point out that the current demand and supply mismatch is largely due to the overwhelming desire to make the best of location advantage. Noida’s units are very large in size and the buyer cannot afford another location, such as Gurgaon or Delhi. Had the developers in Noida sized their units correctly, based on researching the buyers’ needs, they would have been able to sell more.

Is there enough market research for home buyers?,19 August,"When Ratan Pandit, a school teacher, searched online for information to buy a house in Noida Extension, the results left him completely confused. While some property consultancy firms endorsed this market as a future investment magnet, others advised buyers to stay away due to over-supply. Even various property listing sites could not help Pandit to understand the market. Pandit’s experience is echoed by many home buyers, who rue the absence of reliable research and conflicting reports on India’s housing market. “What I needed, was information on the short-term, medium-term and long-term prospects of the market and a comparative study of the investment-worthy projects in the region. However, most of the reports were market feasibility studies from the industry’s view point. I could not find a single report that had been done from the perspective of home buyers,” lamented Pandit. Analysts seem to agree with Pandit’s observation. Nevertheless, they maintain that research in any industry, including real estate, is completely misunderstood owing to the different parameters involved. One such research pertains to the economic aspects and maps demand. A lot of developers know their market and its prevalent demand and choose the type of project accordingly, while others would like to know the psychology of the consumer. See also: Are referrals an effective strategy in real estate? The next type of research pertains to the product and deals with the type of amenities to be offered and other parameters. Then comes the pricing, which itself can be misleading. Pricing, in absolute terms, means nothing and it has to be linked with affordability. So, if a report suggests the mean affordability of a certain location or serves to identify the target buyers, then, one can price the product accordingly. In the absence of scientific research that is beneficial to home buyers, the market has many vacant and unsold units, even though demand is three times higher than supply. Naushad Panjwani, managing partner, Mandarus Partners LLP, agrees that there is not enough research on which the end-user could rest his decision making. While developers and HNIs may have access to such research, for the end-users the decision is often based on emotional connect. The cost of the house and its proximity to one’s work place remain the most important considerations. Nikhil Hawelia, MD of the Hawelia Group, feels that the challenge is not the absence of research, but how to make it available to the target buyers. According to him, most of the market feasibility studies that developers commission to research agencies, are meant to assess the market from the standpoint of potential buyers. However, it is then confined to the developers’ internal assessment team, instead of being made public, he points out, adding that it restricts fair competition in the market. “Half the problem will be solved, if developers move away from a mindset that one’s feasibility report should not be used by other developers in the same market. Moreover, developers must use the research, to have an open dialogue with buyers and boost transparency,” he argues. There are many reasons why a person buys a house – it could be economic, emotional or even for a sense of security. A person may also buy a house, with the aim of earning rental yield or for capital appreciation. Nevertheless, until transparency improves and greater scientific research is available for the developers, as well as the home buyers, the mismatch between demand and supply in the Indian housing market is likely to remain high.

"MBAs make good managers, not necessarily good leaders: DDI study",29 April,"Moneycontrol BureauA research by consultancy firm Dimensions Development International (DDI), says that when it comes to the full range of leadership skills required in today’s complex business environment, an MBA may not always be the best choice.""MBA degrees did indeed make better managers,"" says Evan Sinar, DDI’s Chief Scientist and Director, and author of the report.""Unfortunately, the same couldn’t be said for their impact on stronger leadership,"" he says.The research is based on 15,000 leaders across 300 companies and 18 countries who participated in assessment center evaluations over the last nine years.DDI’s research compared the performance of undergraduate business degrees and MBA degree holders against eight leader skills: financial acumen, business savvy, compelling communication, driving execution, driving for results, entrepreneurship, influence and inspiring excellence. These two groups diverged on several key leader skills. Specifically, though MBA graduates consistently outperformed business degree undergraduates in financial acumen, business savvy and strategic decision making, they fell short comparatively in their coaching, results orientation and visionary leadership skills. ""While management skills are consistently higher for MBA graduates, we were surprised to find there are several skills that are lower,"" Sinar says. ""These are significant shortcomings when you consider the cost of the investment,"" he says, adding, ""MBA students need more well-rounded background and experiences to learn the important interaction and inspirational skills they will need to truly excel as leaders,"" says Sinar. Sinar feels these skills are developable with sustained focus, but can’t be learned in an academic classroom. ""Skills practice with employees, expert coaching/mentoring and abundant on-the-job application opportunities are critical to make these challenging skills stick,"" he says.For aspiring leaders, it’s important to strike a balance between the critical technical expertisethat most undergraduate degrees provide, with an awareness of common skill gaps that, if left unchecked, will limit overall leadership effectiveness and career mobility. Excerpts from the DDI release:Many degree programs put a heavier focus on developing graduates’ technical abilities, and much less emphasis on interpersonal and leadership skills. Though some degree programs fill this gap with group projects and informal leadership opportunities, it’s often up to the student to plan for and seek out these opportunities. Engineering, law, IT, and natural sciences graduates are particularly likely to fall behind their peers from other degree backgrounds in leadership skills. This isn’t always a problem when graduates start out at a new job as an individual contributor, but can hold them back when they want to move into a management position. It’s also a way to set a candidate apart from the pack of other graduates in the field, if they have put the time and effort into gaining the skills others lack. Sinar’s advice: ""Get as much information as you can—using your career planning office if you’re still in school, or working with your HR department once you’re in a job—to know your leadership-related strengths and weaknesses and invest in development opportunities to give you the skills you’ll need and plenty of time to practice them before you need them.""",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/companies/mbas-make-good-managers-not-necessarily-good-leaders-ddi-study-1019394.html,Research,"""Unfortunately, the same couldn’t be said for their impact on stronger leadership,"" he says.The research is based on 15,000 leaders across 300 companies and 18 countries who participated in assessment center evaluations over the last nine years.DDI’s research compared the performance of undergraduate business degrees and MBA degree holders against eight leader skills: financial acumen, business savvy, compelling communication, driving execution, driving for results, entrepreneurship, influence and inspiring excellence.Sinar’s advice: ""Get as much information as you can—using your career planning office if you’re still in school, or working with your HR department once you’re in a job—to know your leadership-related strengths and weaknesses and invest in development opportunities to give you the skills you’ll need and plenty of time to practice them before you need them.""",[],[]

Senior citizens above the age of 80 years, who are not covered by health insurance, will be allowed deduction of Rs 30,000 towards medical expenditures, added FM in his Union Budget speech.The increase in health insurance premium will enable people to seek out for quality healthcare which is a huge concern in the country.  However, Jaitley, once again disappointed the pharmaceutical industry with no major announcements. The only key announcement made by the FM in his first full year Budget for the Modi government today was the proposal of AIIMS in five new states, three new National Institute of Pharmaceuticals Education and Research in Maharashtra, Rajasthan and Chattisgarh and one Institute of Science and Education Research to be set up in Nagaland and Orissa each. The move will address issue of severe shortage of doctors and skilled staff.The Indian pharmaceutical market is expected to grow to USD 55 billion by 2020.

"Maruti to invest Rs 4,000cr in key areas over 2-3 years",04 November,"Country's largest car maker Maruti Suzuki India is investing up to Rs 4,000 crore in the next 2-3 years in key areas like product development, R&D and marketing infrastructure, a senior MSIL official said today. MSIL would also focus more on bringing out models with auto gear shift technology, going forward, executive director- engineering, CV Raman said. ""Currently Rs 4,000 crore worth of investments are going into research and development, product development and marketing infrastructure over period of two to three years (including the current year),” he said, on the sidelines of the launch of the company’s new version of Alto K10 hatchback.""We will be improving our R&D capability. We are setting up test labs and other facilities. Marketing infrastructure such as setting up stockyards will be created,"" Raman added.The company is expected to come out with a SUV- XA Alpha- next year, he said. Replying to a query, Raman said as of now there are no plans to make diesel engines while Suzuki is working on various types of engines in diesel. On the reports of crash test failure of Swift, Raman said the car meets all standards set by the Indian government. ""All MSIL as well as other vehicles comply with Indian regulations. As far as the Swift is concerned, the test is not mandatory in India. There is no regulation to pass that test,"" he said. According to the Global NCAP, an umbrella body of consumer car safety testing bodies, crash tests of Nissan's Datsun GO and Maruti-Suzuki's Swift demonstrated a high risk of life-threatening injuries with both cars receiving zero-star safety rating for their adult occupant protection. He asserted that the Global NCAP report will not have any impact on Swift sales. The production of auto gear shift models is being ramped up to meet the market demand, he said. ""Currently, roughly about 4,000 vehicles (are being produced) per month with AGS technology and going forward will ramp up this number. We feel that the two pedal technology is very relevant now. Obviously the auto gear models would increase the volume. Maybe in future we look at coming out with more models in AGS,"" he said.Raman said the sales of diesel vehicles could go up as the price difference between petrol and diesel is narrowing.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/companies/maruti-to-invest-rs-4000crkey-areas-over-2-3-years-1573867.html,Research,"""Currently Rs 4,000 crore worth of investments are going into research and development, product development and marketing infrastructure over period of two to three years (including the current year),” he said, on the sidelines of the launch of the company’s new version of Alto K10 hatchback.Maybe in future we look at coming out with more models in AGS,"" he said.Raman said the sales of diesel vehicles could go up as the price difference between petrol and diesel is narrowing.",['AGS'],[]
Why Apollo Tyres may add to its sterling run,01 September,"Moneycontrol BureauShares in Apollo Tyres have had a superb run over the past one year, eclipsing the BSE Midcap index’s nearly 75 percent rise with a 160 percent gain.A number of brokerages have issued research reports recently stating they believe the shares have further room to run.According to reports by ICICI Direct, Sharekhan and FirstCall, the stocks can rise from their current levels (Rs 160) to between Rs 204 and Rs 240 – a upside potential of between 27 percent and 50 percent.Apollo was in the news last year after its ambitious USD 2.5-billion takeover bid for US’s Cooper Tires fell through.

CEO/CXO level gets around 24% of the pool. -- Close to two thirds of the companies do not grant options to Non Executive / Independent Directors. -- Companies are increasingly moving from individual performance criteria for vesting to vesting based on company performance targets (both top line and bottom line). -- Listed companies are increasingly outsourcing plan management “The trends over the last 3-4 years clearly show that companies have seen distinct advantages by issuing ESOPs by achieving higher retention and employee motivation”, said Harshu Ghate, Co-Founder & CEO at ESOP Direct. “Companies have also rectified some of the features and coverage criteria based on their experiences” he said.

Allowing greater tax deductions can fuel innovation in pharma sector: Biocon's Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw,15 February,"Welcoming Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman’s budget day announcement of a new research programme promoting growth in the pharmaceuticals sector, Biocon chief Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw said the drug manufacturing industry needs more push in research and development (R&D) in terms of investment.In an exclusive conversation with Moneycontrol, she emphasised the need for research incentive policies that will not impact profitability.“We have shared simple policy recommendations, where we have said that the weighted tax deduction is a very good way of incentivising R&D investments, which I think is something that the government should consider,” said the Biocon chief.Terming the announcement as a ‘step in the right direction’, Shaw said the pharma industry awaits the granular details of the programme.Also read: Pharma manufacturing needs a robust regulatory system: Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw“We are yet to see the fine print of the scheme. Until we see that, it's very difficult for me to comment, but obviously, it's a step in the right direction,” she added.The Biocon chief also highlighted the importance of capitalizing on the R&D investment in India for better growth prospects.“We need to look at ways of capitalizing on R&D investment in India so that it doesn't hit your profit and loss, and that is the real concern because most companies are shy of investing in R&D beyond a point due to the same reason which is what happens to us.”Also read: Pharma industry hails budget’s 'positive thrust on research, innovation'Shaw says the road ahead is challenging for pharma companies in terms of balancing R&D with profitability as cutting costs on research might have a risk in future.“The R&D is the lifeline of companies like ours, and we often say the pipeline is our lifeline. Without investing in R&D, we cannot future-proof our business. So we are caught between this challenge of reducing R&D investments and then risking our future,” she added.Commenting on Immuneel breakthrough cell therapy facility for cancer treatment in India, Shaw said the motive behind working on those developments was to put India on the map of the CAR-T world.“The focus should be on developing a robust regulatory body to approve these kinds of products. We often get trapped in the regulations, which are not very favourable for these kinds of technologies, because of a lack of domain expertise. We will miss the boat if we don't have good regulatory capabilities to approve these types of products,” the Biocon chief added.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/trends/allowing-greater-tax-deductions-can-fuel-innovation-in-pharma-sector-biocons-kiran-mazumdar-shaw-10091371.html,Research,"Welcoming Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman’s budget day announcement of a new research programme promoting growth in the pharmaceuticals sector, Biocon chief Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw said the drug manufacturing industry needs more push in research and development (R&D) in terms of investment.In an exclusive conversation with Moneycontrol, she emphasised the need for research incentive policies that will not impact profitability.“We have shared simple policy recommendations, where we have said that the weighted tax deduction is a very good way of incentivising R&D investments, which I think is something that the government should consider,” said the Biocon chief.Terming the announcement as a ‘step in the right direction’, Shaw said the pharma industry awaits the granular details of the programme.Also read: Pharma manufacturing needs a robust regulatory system: Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw“We are yet to see the fine print of the scheme.Until we see that, it's very difficult for me to comment, but obviously, it's a step in the right direction,” she added.The Biocon chief also highlighted the importance of capitalizing on the R&D investment in India for better growth prospects.“We need to look at ways of capitalizing on R&D investment in India so that it doesn't hit your profit and loss, and that is the real concern because most companies are shy of investing in R&D beyond a point due to the same reason which is what happens to us.”Also read: Pharma industry hails budget’s 'positive thrust on research, innovation'Shaw says the road ahead is challenging for pharma companies in terms of balancing R&D with profitability as cutting costs on research might have a risk in future.“The R&D is the lifeline of companies like ours, and we often say the pipeline is our lifeline.","['Biocon', 'Moneycontrol', 'Biocon', 'Biocon']",[]
"Budget 2023 pushes tech-driven economy, must accelerate innovation for rapid growth",10 February,"India is on a mission in the very first year of Amrit Kaal. This mission is technology-driven. Technology will therefore be centre-stage during this phase of socioeconomic growth and development. We are the bright spot in a turbulent world.However, India is currently 40th in the Global Innovation Index 2022. While we have leapfrogged by 41 counts in a span of seven years, we must aspire to be in the top 25 in the near term and in the top five by India @ 100. The Prime Minister has provided a huge impetus to innovation by adding Jai Anusandhan to the country’s evergreen slogan of Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan, Jai Vigyan.On the other hand, the world is being disrupted on many fronts, including global value chains, the entire process of energy transition, health, etc. We are all on an equal footing. This is an opportune moment for instilling innovation into our DNA, and for taking the lead.The government with Budget 2023 has offered a multidimensional, inclusive view on technology, innovation and research. I would like to specifically highlight five of these.First, the clear and correct emphasis on the collective and cohesive working of four key stakeholders in the technology ecosystem—industry, academia, research labs and startups—which we refer to as the National Research Quad (NRQ). The announcement on making ICMR labs available for research to academic institutions as well as the private sector for R&D will accelerate innovation in the critical sphere of medicine for all. In addition, the proposal of setting up of 100 labs in engineering institutions for developing 5G services will create a new range of technologies and business models for quantum communication. Again, for all.Second is the impetus given to R&D and high-end manufacturing in pharma, medical technology, green tech, circular economy, agritech, millet research. This is timely and critical for the future.Third, there is a clear focus on creating enabling and inclusive policies for technology-led development. For example, setting up a National Data Governance Policy, simplifying fintech regulations, a deep focus on energy transition and net zero, incentives for startups and rural women, etc.Fourth, the focus on emerging technology with the announcement of the launch of three centres of excellence. This, when reinforced with industry participation in conducting interdisciplinary research, developing cutting-edge applications and scalable solutions to problems, will lay the foundation for an effective emerging technology, research and innovation ecosystem in India.And finally, the budget lays a strong emphasis on digital skilling covering new-age courses for Industry 4.0 like coding, AI, robotics, mechatronics, internet of things, 3D printing, drones and soft skills. Skilling lakhs of youth, on-the-job training, industry partnership and alignment of courses with the needs of industry, setting up of 30 Skill India International Centres will generate a future-ready workforce, thereby adding to the competitiveness of businesses and, ultimately, that of our nation as a whole.Innovation is a team effort and often prospers through hit-and-miss. It requires continual collaboration. This is because almost every technology is a combination of other technologies. Likewise, almost every idea is a combination of other ideas. Therefore, it is critical that all stakeholders—the NRQ—are brought together with enablement by the government. This is exactly what the budget seeks to do. We, the stakeholders, must now do our bit. This is the right time to give a thrust to the virtuous cycle of innovation.Vipin Sondhi is chairman, CII National Mission on Technology, Innovation and Research, and former MD and CEO, Ashok Leyland and JCB India",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/budget/budget-2023-pushes-tech-driven-economy-must-accelerate-innovation-for-rapid-growth-10049101.html,Research,"I would like to specifically highlight five of these.First, the clear and correct emphasis on the collective and cohesive working of four key stakeholders in the technology ecosystem—industry, academia, research labs and startups—which we refer to as the National Research Quad (NRQ).Skilling lakhs of youth, on-the-job training, industry partnership and alignment of courses with the needs of industry, setting up of 30 Skill India International Centres will generate a future-ready workforce, thereby adding to the competitiveness of businesses and, ultimately, that of our nation as a whole.Innovation is a team effort and often prospers through hit-and-miss.","['the National Research Quad', 'Skill India International Centres']",[]

"Bill Gates upbeat on climate innovation, even if 1.5C goal out of reach",20 December,"When it comes to climate change, Bill Gates considers himself a realist - even if that means admitting the world has no chance limiting warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius.Given ""the overall scale of our industrial economy we're going to have to do mind-blowing work to stay below 2 degrees,"" he said.But on meeting the Paris Agreement's 1.5C goal? No one wants to be ""the first to say it,"" but the math shows it's no longer within reach, Gates said in a video interview with Reuters.The software-developer-turned-philanthropist was nevertheless upbeat about climate innovation - ticking off numerous areas advancing low-carbon technologies with funding from the Breakthrough Energy Group, which Gates founded in 2015.Gates has invested more than $2 billion toward climate technologies, including direct air capture, solar energy and nuclear fission. The 14-year-old fission company under the Breakthrough umbrella, TerraPower, aims to have a demo reactor running by 2030.These things take time, said Gates, co-founder of Microsoft Corp.Gates spoke with Reuters ahead of the release of his annual letter - reflecting on 2022 and describing what he's most excited about in the year ahead.He transferred $20 billion of his funds to the Gates Foundation's endowment, which plans to increase philanthropic spending on public health and education from $6 billion to $9 billion in coming years.He also praised Warren Buffett for his contribution, which Gates said totaled $45 billion since 2006, counting Berkshire Hathaway stock appreciation.Breakthrough Energy, however, operates separately from the Gates Foundation charity. In his letter to shareholders, Gates explains that the climate problem is too enormous for philanthropy alone to tackle.""There's not enough money, and so you have to have some innovation,"" he told Reuters. ""The idea that it can be done by brute force, there's just no chance.""Companies need investment and technical support to prove their low-carbon ideas beyond the pilot phase - and then to scale up manufacturing, he says. But any Breakthrough Energy profits are funneled back into the group or to the foundation.Some of the companies under Breakthrough that are developing Direct Air Capture (DAC) - technology designed to pull CO2 straight from the atmosphere - have their sights set on some $3.5 billion in newly announced U.S. contracts to build DAC plants and fund research grants.""We have a number of Direct Air Capture companies that will bid on being a part of those projects,"" he said, noting that the recent Inflation Reduction Act legislation has boosted prospects for climate innovation. He did not elaborate on the DAC companies' plans.In manufacturing, the steel and cement industries have made ""fantastic"" progress, he said, a change from his worries about that sector just two years ago.Manufacturing is responsible for about a third of global climate-warming emissions.Now, ""there's no area of climate mitigation that I feel like 'Oh, that's really completely uncovered,'"" he said.Instead, with the world set to push past 1.5C of warming, he said the challenge is shifting toward helping people adapt to a harsher, hotter future.""In addition to mitigation, which will still be the biggest part (of Breakthrough Energy's investment), we'll also fund adaptation-related work.""

Nobel prizes most often go to researchers who defy specialization,08 October,"Experts often recommend that people specialize in one field of work or research to maximize their chances of success. Yet our recently published research indicates that successful innovators take a broader path.We looked at the careers of Nobel Prize winners, who are arguably among the most innovative people in the world. We found that they are unusually likely to be what we call “creative polymaths.” That is, they purposely integrate formal and informal expertise from widely varied disciplines to yield new and useful ideas and practices.In fact, the testimony of science laureates who were students of previous laureates suggests that creative polymathy is a skill that can be learned. We have written about some of these in our books “Discovering” and “Sparks of Genius.”Many of these laureates discover problems by looking at topics in new ways, or they solve them by transferring skills, techniques and materials from one field to another. They often use conceptual tools such as making analogies, pattern recognition, body thinking, playacting and modeling. In one notable example, Alexis Carrel won his Nobel Prize in medicine in 1912 by adapting lace-making and embroidery techniques to transplant surgery.A psychologist, inventor and economistHerbert Simon won the Nobel Prize in economics in 1978 for “his pioneering research into the decision-making process within economic organizations.”He was a professor in several departments at Carnegie Mellon University. His colleagues often called him a “Renaissance man” because of his vast range of interests and wide-ranging curiosity. Over the course of his career, he made major contributions to the study of computer science, artificial intelligence, psychology and philosophy, as well as economics.Beyond Simon’s scholarly work, his additional interests included piano playing, musical composition, drawing, painting and chess.He often referred to the intellectual excitement, emotional pleasure and novel insights he derived from integrating his many hobbies with his work.“I can rationalize any activity I engage in as simply another form of research on cognition,” he declared in his 1996 autobiography. He went on to add, “I can always view my hobbies as part of my research.”A geneticist, illustrator and cookbook authorChristiane Nüsslein-Volhard combined an equally diverse range of skills to win the 1995 Nobel Prize in physiology – or medicine – which was awarded for her “discoveries concerning the genetic control of early embryonic development.”“I’m very curious and I like to understand things,” she said in a 2003 interview, “and not only science … I also did music and I did languages and literature and so on.”That included forays as an illustrator, puzzle designer and author of a best-selling cookbook.As a science student, Nüsslein-Volhard proved equally broad-minded, trying physics, physical chemistry and biochemistry before settling on embryology. Her many professional and personal interests proved useful in coming up with new questions and techniques, and in order to produce novel results. She advises scholars to become similarly broad and idiosyncratic.In a 2017 interview, she said, “You should, as far as possible, avoid mainstream areas and change fields after your Ph.D. in order to be able to develop an independent profile and work on an original, self-selected topic.”The importance of creative polymathyWe have found that Carrel, Nüsslein-Volhard and Simon are typical of Nobel Prize winners – but not at all typical of most professionals. As part of our creativity research over the past 20 years, we have gathered information about the work, hobbies and interests of 773 laureates in economics, literature, peace, physics, chemistry and physiology or medicine between 1901 and 2008.We found that the vast majority of laureates have or had formal – and often also informal – education in more than one discipline, developed intensive and extensive hobbies and changed fields. Most importantly, we found, they have intentionally sought out useful connections among their diverse activities as a formal strategy for stimulating creativity.Our analysis finds that scientists who win a Nobel Prize are about nine times more likely to have training in crafts such as wood- and metalworking or fine arts than the typical scientist.And unlike most social scientists or other students of the humanities, Nobel laureates in economics are almost universally trained in mathematics, physics or astronomy. Nobel Prize winners in literature are about three times as likely to be fine artists and 20 times as likely to be actors than members of the general public.In sharp contrast to typical professionals who view their hobbies as irrelevant or even detrimental to their work, Nobel laureates perceive their varied interests and hobbies as important stimulants.As playwright and actor Dario Fo, winner of the 1997 Nobel for literature, and also a painter, put it in an interview: “Sometimes I draw my plays before I write them, and other times, when I’m having difficulty with a play, I stop writing so that I can draw out the action in pictures to solve the problem.”We have found that most Nobel laureates have made equivalent statements. Leonardo da Vinci was a famous polymath. (Photo: Eric Terrade via Unsplash)Fostering creative polymathyWe believe it is possible to foster the fruitful interaction of wide-ranging interests. One study found that people who double major in college are more likely to exhibit creative behaviors or become entrepreneurs than people who majored in one subject.Another research study found that having a persistent, intellectually challenging hobby – such as musical performance, acting, visual art exhibition, competitive chess or computer programming – is a better predictor of career success in any field than are grades, standardized test scores or IQ. Similarly, our own research has found that science professionals with persistent crafts hobbies are significantly more likely to file patents and set up new companies than those without.In our view, an increasingly complex and diverse world needs not only specialized experts but also creative generalists – the polymathic types who specialize in the breadth and integration that drive knowledge beyond what people already believe is possible.By Robert Root-Bernstein, Professor of Physiology, Michigan State University and Michele Root-Bernstein, Adjunct Professor of Theater, Michigan State UniversityThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

"ICT services export, market sophistication helps India to move up in Global Innovation Index",30 September,"India’s jump in the Global Innovation Index (GII) rankings is mainly on the account of its growth in ICT (information and communications technology) services exports, market sophistication and labour productivity growth, according to World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO).The country moved up six spots to be the 40th spot in this year’s edition of the index run by WIPO, which is one of the 15 specialised agencies of the United Nations.“India overtakes Vietnam as the leader of the lower middle-income group. It continues to lead the world in the ICT services exports indicator and hold top rankings in other indicators, including venture capital recipients’ value, finance for startups and scaleups, graduates in science and engineering, labor productivity growth and domestic industry diversification,” said WIPO in its report.Among the seven GII pillar ranks, India scored best in market sophistication (19), while it ranked its lowest in infrastructure (78).Responding to the improvement in India’s ranking through a virtual address during the launch of the report, Union minister for commerce and industry Piyush Goyal said that as the importance of the ‘knowledge economy’ grows, innovation will lay the roadmap for development in India.“We have been working to strengthen research and development across sectors as amplified by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi’s clarion call to make innovation our nation’s mission,” he added.Among indicators that form the basis for the seven pillar ranks, India topped the chart for ICT services exports and domestic market scale. The country also ranked high in venture capital received (6), finance for startups and scaleups (8), graduates in science and engineering (11), entrepreneurship policies and culture (12), and cultural creative services exports (12).However, India did poorly in environmental performance (130), new businesses (114), number of students from abroad studying in the country (109) and females employed with advanced degrees (103).Rise in IP filingsThere has been a steady rise in intellectual property (IP) filings in India as the number of patents applications went up from 15,914 in 2011 to 37,880 in 2020. For trademarks, the figure rose from 194,796 to 418,560 during the same period.“Domestic filing of patents registered a 46 percent growth in the last five years. We are now transitioning to a knowledge-based economy,” said Goyal.However, there has been a drop in industrial design applications after reaching its highest figure in 2018.Data shows that foreign applicants lead when it comes to patent filings in India. In 2020, non-residents filed as many as 33,630 patent applications and were granted 21,373 patents. Meanwhile resident Indians made 23,141 patent applications and were granted 4,988 patents.Moreover, as many as 14,739 Indians filed for patents in other countries, and were granted 8,081 patents.Top Indian performersCiting data from the European Commission’s Joint Research Centre, the report recognised Tata Motors as biggest corporate R&D investor from India. The automobile company made investments in research and development worth 1,965 million euros in 2020 and ranked 79 globally for the same. Tata Motors is the lone Indian company to enter the top 100 list.In its report, WIPO also cited global university rankings by QS Quacquarelli Symonds, a UK-based company specialising in the analysis of higher education institutions around the world. None of the Indian universities featured in the top 100 chart, as IIT Bombay, the highest ranking Indian university, came in 177th in the list.IIT Delhi, the second highest ranked from India, and IIT Bangalore, the third highest, came in 185th and 186th, respectively.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/economy/ict-services-export-market-sophistication-helps-india-to-move-up-in-global-innovation-index-9258671.html,Research,"It continues to lead the world in the ICT services exports indicator and hold top rankings in other indicators, including venture capital recipients’ value, finance for startups and scaleups, graduates in science and engineering, labor productivity growth and domestic industry diversification,” said WIPO in its report.Among the seven GII pillar ranks, India scored best in market sophistication (19), while it ranked its lowest in infrastructure (78).Responding to the improvement in India’s ranking through a virtual address during the launch of the report, Union minister for commerce and industry Piyush Goyal said that as the importance of the ‘knowledge economy’ grows, innovation will lay the roadmap for development in India.“We have been working to strengthen research and development across sectors as amplified by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi’s clarion call to make innovation our nation’s mission,” he added.Among indicators that form the basis for the seven pillar ranks, India topped the chart for ICT services exports and domestic market scale.The country also ranked high in venture capital received (6), finance for startups and scaleups (8), graduates in science and engineering (11), entrepreneurship policies and culture (12), and cultural creative services exports (12).However, India did poorly in environmental performance (130), new businesses (114), number of students from abroad studying in the country (109) and females employed with advanced degrees (103).Rise in IP filingsThere has been a steady rise in intellectual property (IP) filings in India as the number of patents applications went up from 15,914 in 2011 to 37,880 in 2020.","['ICT', 'WIPO', 'GII', 'Piyush Goyal', 'ICT', 'IP', 'IP']",[]

How should fintechs prepare for a crackdown? Sebi chief offers a checklist,21 September,"“I love the fintech world”: That’s how Madhabi Puri Buch, chairperson of Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) began her address at the Global Fintech Fest. She said SEBI has been late to the party in the past but is now planning to narrow down the regulatory gap in the startup ecosystem.She explained, “By construct, a regulatory gap will always exist. If startups are building something completely new, then it has not even entered the heads of those in the regulatory body. But, when we finally show up, what is it that fintech innovators should have kept in mind to avoid crackdown?”Here’s a checklist:If anonymity is a key selling proposition, it will not last: “Anonymity in the financial world is an absolute no-no and that should be the first guiding principle for businesses,” she said. Startups need to build on credible data.Transparency is key: The regulator's principal job is to ensure that investors make informed decisions. “If your business model is woven around a black box, which is not open to sunlight or not capable of being audited or validated, it cannot be permitted,” she said. If your algorithm claims 350 percent returns in one year, it has to be verified!Financial inclusion: If a fintech’s business model facilitates financial inclusion, the regulator is bound to be supportive.Ease of exit: “We don’t want ‘Abhimayus’ in the market. Ek baar bakra aa gaya toh usko bahar jaane nahin denge.” SEBI chief stressed that such business models will not be supported by the regulator.“Building barriers to exit for customers is unlikely to find favour with us. Customers should be able to exit, as easily as they entered your ecosystem,” she told innovators and investors.Infrastructure for innovation will be a public good: Build on public rails. Private innovation should be over and above this. Founders cannot say that they want to own the infrastructure, she said, citing the examples of Aadhaar and UPI (Unified Payments Interface).“If startup founders keep these principles in mind, they will not get a rude shock from the regulators,” Buch concluded.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/how-should-fintechs-prepare-for-a-regulatory-crackdown-sebi-chief-offers-a-checklist-9208951.html,Research,"But, when we finally show up, what is it that fintech innovators should have kept in mind to avoid crackdown?”Here’s a checklist:If anonymity is a key selling proposition, it will not last: “Anonymity in the financial world is an absolute no-no and that should be the first guiding principle for businesses,” she said.If your algorithm claims 350 percent returns in one year, it has to be verified!Financial inclusion: If a fintech’s business model facilitates financial inclusion, the regulator is bound to be supportive.Ease of exit: “We don’t want ‘Abhimayus’ in the market.",[],[]

Meet the Srinagar engineer who turned his 1988 Nissan Micra into a solar-powered EV,25 June,"What do you do with a really old car, at a time when petrol costs more than Rs 100 at your nearest petrol pump?An engineer in Srinagar, Bilal Ahmad Mir, 41, has turned his 1988 Nissan Micra into a solar-powered electric vehicle (EV).To be sure, he couldn't have done it in anticipation of petrol breaching Rs 100 a litre - though he is citing the current cost of gas as another reason to support his EV.It has taken Mir over a decade to complete the car transformation. Now, he says, he's raring to scale it, because ""not everyone is able to have a car, mainly when fuel prices are soaring"".Start lineMir hails from Srinagar’s uptown Sanat Nagar area. For the last 13 years, he says he's been spending 3-5 hours per day and 40 percent of his income per month on the project - the total cost of the prototype has come to about Rs 15 lakh.During the development stage, Mir says he studied how luxury car makers, from DeLorean to Tesla, do things. One place where the design inspiration can be seen is in the gull-wing doors.Seeing photos of the car, former Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Omar Abdullah tweeted: “Solar car with #DeLorean #BackToTheFuture style doors. Certainly looks the part.”Solar car with #DeLorean #BackToTheFuture style doors. Certainly looks the part. https://t.co/fKF7iZup4j— Omar Abdullah (@OmarAbdullah) June 20, 2022Mir is now seeking government and public support to scale his idea, and open a car manufacturing plant similar to The DeLorean Motor Company (DMC).“I was inspired by engineer and innovator DeLorean who started a company DMC which ultimately motivated me to make a luxurious as well as affordable car for the common people... I would open a motor company similar to DeLorean for mass production of cars. I will name the company YMC after my children Yusha and Mysha,” Mir says.How it worksMir's car runs on the electrical energy generated by the monocrystalline solar panels.“It was originally a 1988 Nissan Micra car which I converted into a fully-automatic car,"" Mir explains. ""Almost every available surface of my car is covered in solar panels, from the bonnet to the rear windshield. Besides that I have put in gull-wing doors, which open upwards - like the ones in a Ferrari.”Every year in winters, there's a power crisis in Kashmir. Mir says his EV can generate energy from solar panels even on low sunlight days. “Initially I created it as an electric vehicle (EV) but later I added solar panels to supplement the power,” Mir adds.Besides being an engineer, Mir teaches maths to hundreds of students at a private tuition centre in Srinagar’s Parraypora. Mir says his love of maths came in handy on the project, in areas like ""the weight management of the car and balancing the gullwing doors (which) was an uphill task”.Mir says his work on the car concluded in May and the response on social media has been very positive. Mir is being supported by the innovation centre at the National Institute of Technology (NIT) Srinagar. He has also filed a patent for his car, and is waiting for the response.If it goes to production, Mir has a name for the car, too.

'Golden time for India to emerge as innovator nation in biopharma sector',23 June,"Post COVID19, it's a golden time for India to emerge as an innovator nation in the biopharma sector, organiser of the annual India-US Healthcare Summit said ahead of the 16th edition of the meeting this week.This is a Golden Time for India to emerge as an innovator nation in the Biopharma sector. Key fundamentals under play are: current geo-political situation, innovation driven mindset of India's top leadership, and momentum in the western world for diversity, inclusiveness and equity in clinical trials, said Karun Rishi, president of USA-India Chamber of Commerce.Being held virtually, like the previous two years, USAICC said the 16th annual BioPharma & Healthcare Summit is being attended by several thousand from across the world. Indian government and industry leaders participating are Dr Vinod Paul, Member, NITI Aayog, Hari Bhartia, Kiran Mazumdar Shaw, Naresh Trehan, and Shiv Sarin.There is a strong participation from the US government. Lawrence Tabak, Acting Director, National Institutes of Health (NIH) and Max Bronstein, Assistant Director for Health Innovation in the White House Office of Science & Technology Policy (OSTP) are confirmed so are the past NIH Director Elias Zerhouni and the former US CDC Director Julie Gerberding.Participation of Johnson & Johnson's Executive Chairman Alex Gorsky, Biogen's Chairman Stelios Papadopoulos along with top venture capitalists, academic leaders from the Harvard, MIT and global Research and Development heads of Janssen, Takeda, Sanofi, Amgen, Bayer, UCB and several other leading companies demonstrates the interest of global biopharma companies to collaborate with India, USAICC said.COVID-19 VaccineFrequently Asked QuestionsA vaccine works by mimicking a natural infection. A vaccine not only induces immune response to protect people from any future COVID-19 infection, but also helps quickly build herd immunity to put an end to the pandemic. Herd immunity occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population becomes immune to a disease, making the spread of disease from person to person unlikely. The good news is that SARS-CoV-2 virus has been fairly stable, which increases the viability of a vaccine.There are broadly four types of vaccine — one, a vaccine based on the whole virus (this could be either inactivated, or an attenuated [weakened] virus vaccine); two, a non-replicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of SARS-CoV; three, nucleic-acid vaccines that have genetic material like DNA and RNA of antigens like spike protein given to a person, helping  human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine; and four, protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombinant proteins of SARS-COV-2 along with an adjuvant (booster) is given as a vaccine.Vaccine development is a long, complex process. Unlike drugs that are given to people with a diseased, vaccines are given to healthy people and also vulnerable sections such as children, pregnant women and the elderly. So rigorous tests are compulsory. History says that the fastest time it took to develop a vaccine is five years, but it usually takes double or sometimes triple that time.Over the past few years, positive regulatory policies have been framed. Still, the global clinical trials being done in India are a very small percentage of overall global trials. This does not reflect India's true potential, Rishi said.Robust clinical trials infrastructure and pragmatic regulatory policies are key for global clinical trials to come to India on a large scale. This will pave way for collaborations, investments, startups, employment generation of high paying jobs and GDP growth.Entire innovation ecosystem will be created in India, he said.Rishi said developing and nurturing the next generation of innovative leaders in biopharma is fundamental to India becoming an innovation nation and source of innovation for accelerating discovery, development and manufacture novel therapeutics for India and for the rest of the world.This is achievable. Political will is there. We need to work together for the common goal- patients. Global biopharma industry and the Indian government need to collaborate, communicate and remove trust deficit for the sake of patients, Rishi said.Andrew Plump, president of R&D, Takeda Pharmaceuticals said this year's 16th Annual USAIC BioPharma & Healthcare Summit will convene and engage leaders to share their insights on critical topics driving the biopharma ecosystem.This year we are introducing a special panel focused on the clinical trial landscape in India, and we hope to identify opportunities where USAIC can collaborate with key stakeholders in India to promote clinical trial infrastructure, incentivise multinational biopharmaceutical companies to conduct trials, and ultimately enhance Indian patients' access to innovative medicines, he said.Kiran Mazumdar Shaw, executive chairperson, Biocon Group and USAIC advisory Board member said that India's innovation ecosystem is developing rapidly on a platform of technology convergence. ""India's IT prowess has catalysed a Digital focus on biopharma innovation that is generating AI-powered diagnostics, Digital Health management and software for drug discovery, she said.""Handheld breast mammograms, AI powered CT-scans with instant readouts and rapid tests for viral and bacterial infections are some of the examples. Cell and gene therapies are also seeing rapid development with at least 3 start-ups with CAR-Ts in the clinic, she said.The pandemic has revitalized the clinical research eco-system and the decade ahead will see India's biopharma space investing exponentially in discovery led innovation. USAIC's tireless efforts of driving India's innovation efforts over the last 16 years are finally being realized, said Shaw.Innovation in the biopharma industry continues to be fueled by scientific and technological advancements. The COVID-19 pandemic further expedited digitalization, transforming drug research & development.Today several clinical trials are held virtually, with on-site visits limited to high-risk interventions and invasive monitoring, said Hari Bhartia, founder & co-chairman, Jubilant Bhartia Group.

"New ideas, products happen on whiteboard not behind Zoom. Here's why InMobi founder Naveen Tewari wants employees at office",20 June,"Working from home leaves little room for innovation and weakens the effectiveness of on-the-job training for freshers, according to Naveen Tewari, chief executive officer of mobile advertising technology company InMobi, and Glance, a software company personalising smartphone lock screens.“If you are working on creating cutting-edge, new products or ideas, it doesn't happen sitting behind Zoom or Teams calls. You have to be in front of each other, on a whiteboard exchanging ideas,” said Tewari in a recent episode of Bits to Billions. InMobi is the first Indian unicorn that entered the coveted club in 2011 and Glance also became a unicorn in late 2020.He believes physical brainstorming is a necessity for all levels of the workforce and should not be limited to the core team of the company.Tewari’s remarks come at a time when companies have started calling employees back to the office as India witnesses lower Covid-19 infections amid eased virus restrictions.Lately, cases have slowly been rising again with India reporting 12,899 fresh Covid infections on June 19.Tewari believes that during the last couple of years, people have become used to a different work approach due to the pandemic. Companies now calling them back to the office have to contemplate if they are being considerate enough to their employees.He said, however, that the company is certain about discontinuing virtual work. “We are very clear that we are not going to be one of those who will, you know, continue to work remotely. We will, of course, be a lot open about how to make sure people get rightly adjusted, but we are going to be a work from office organisation.”Many companies are taking up different approaches to lure their employees back to office spaces like providing a grace period to return to offices, opening satellite offices in smaller cities, covering commute costs, and so on.Another reason for asking people to return to offices, Tewari said, was the lower impact of training on remote work as people learn the most from seniors and peers in an office environment. “Earlier, a lot of the people became so well trained, but due to remote work, now there are people who did not receive the same training from people in the office. And suddenly you have this massive gap,” he said.According to Tewari, the gap in training in the workforce will especially affect freshers. He added, “That gap is just going to not be good for those that are actually not yet trained. They're early in their careers, and haven't had the chance to get any mentorship and haven't built any social capital.”Tewari said, “If this is not solved, you might see a delta in the caliber of people who have these two sets, and that's not going to be good for the workforce at large. So we are clearly very aware of it.” He said that his team is working to ensure there is no gap in the skills of employees.Earlier, in another episode of Bits to Billions, Nithin Kamath, CEO, and co-founder of Zerodha, told Moneycontrol that nearly 950 of the 1100 employees at the broking firm will work from home permanently, with the exception of the core team which will operate on a hybrid model.In another Moneycontrol interview, Kamath had mentioned that the company had started setting up satellite offices in smaller towns in Karnataka for employees who had moved back to their hometowns during the pandemic.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/startup/new-ideas-products-happen-on-whiteboard-not-behind-zoo-heres-why-inmobi-founder-naveen-tewari-wants-employees-at-office-8708571.html,Research,"InMobi is the first Indian unicorn that entered the coveted club in 2011 and Glance also became a unicorn in late 2020.He believes physical brainstorming is a necessity for all levels of the workforce and should not be limited to the core team of the company.Tewari’s remarks come at a time when companies have started calling employees back to the office as India witnesses lower Covid-19 infections amid eased virus restrictions.Lately, cases have slowly been rising again with India reporting 12,899 fresh Covid infections on June 19.Tewari believes that during the last couple of years, people have become used to a different work approach due to the pandemic.So we are clearly very aware of it.” He said that his team is working to ensure there is no gap in the skills of employees.Earlier, in another episode of Bits to Billions, Nithin Kamath, CEO, and co-founder of Zerodha, told Moneycontrol that nearly 950 of the 1100 employees at the broking firm will work from home permanently, with the exception of the core team which will operate on a hybrid model.In another Moneycontrol interview, Kamath had mentioned that the company had started setting up satellite offices in smaller towns in Karnataka for employees who had moved back to their hometowns during the pandemic.","['InMobi', 'Bits', 'Zerodha', 'Moneycontrol']",[]

"Book excerpt | The Art and Science of Frugal Innovation by Malavika Dadlani, Anil Wali and Kaushik Mukerjee",10 April,"Frugal innovations are considered most relevant in the context of BOP consumers, wherein the commercial success is attributed to the large volume of business. Therefore, low cost and affordability not only make an innovation useful to a large section of population, but also ensure profitability. It is because of this characteristic that some attach high importance to the commercial success of a frugal innovation, whereas, for others the success may be defined by its societal value or ability to resolve a particular problem. However, there are only limited examples of truly frugal innovations, like Jaipur Foot, which have significant commercial as well as societal impact. Similarly, the role of scientific interventions in the innovation of a frugal technology may not be very evident in all cases but, their importance in making successful innovations, be it a rotavirus vaccine, dengue detection kit, Lab in a Box or a super basmati rice variety, in one shot or in incremental steps, cannot be undermined.What makes an innovation a success or a failure?In order to answer this, we need to understand some fundamental matters. First of all, how do we measure the success of an innovation? Is it the commercial viability, the cost of the product, complexity or severity of the problem it solves, number of people using it or the length of time that an innovation remains relevant?Mashelkar and Pandit (2018) have defined seven key criteria for a transformational innovation and called it ASSURED—an acronym for Affordable, Scalable, Sustainable, Universal, Rapid, Excellent and Distinctive. According to them, environment, energy and employment are the three vital parameters on which the success of technologies are to be measured. But as pointed out above, one might argue that all frugal innovations may not fulfil the criteria of universality or scalability, whereas the parameters of measuring excellence might be different in case of, say, a grassroot innovation and a science-backed innovative technology. On the other hand, factors not covered by these criteria may play a bigger role, such as cultural diffusion and social acceptance or simply, the relevance of an innovation at a given period of time. Which was a bigger game-changer: the wheel, which has lasted many millennia and is still being innovated upon for newer applications? Or the Internet, the broadest and the fastest technological revolution, which not only erased the barriers of information, distance and time, but also changed human behaviour forever?And if an innovation is not successful in terms of generating good business, should it be termed unsuccessful? Examining the criteria and factors that determined the success of some S&T innovations in the recent and not so recent past might help us understand this complex phenomenon.There are many misconceptions surrounding the nature, social acceptability and scientific value of frugal innovation. It is generally believed that frugal innovations are meant to solve problems and challenges faced by people with limited resources. While it is true that affordability at the bottom of the ladder is key to success of a frugal innovation, we also need to acknowledge that every consumer, irrespective of his/ her purchasing power, wants value for money. Therefore, a frugal innovation that is not inferior to its more expensive alternatives will be adopted by users across economic strata. In fact, by adopting a frugal approach, a world class cutting-edge technology can be developed at a fraction of the cost and can directly contribute to sustainability.When a frugal innovation, based on a sound technology, is successful in fulfilling customer needs in developing countries, it may be expected to be successful in developed countries as well. For example, the portable ECG machine (MAC 400) developed by GE for emerging markets sold well in over 100 countries, including some developed markets like US and China. In this case, good technology, affordability and global acceptability all contributed to its success. Possibly, the fact that it came from GE, a company of high repute and credibility, might also have contributed to its success. Recognizing the market potential for portable ECG monitors, particularly for real-time wireless monitoring in ambulances, healthcare centres in remote villages and difficult terrains, as well as at home in the times of war or natural calamities, this device encouraged many small players and start-ups to innovate cheaper, and at times, better substitutes. An Indian firm, Agatsa Software Pvt. Ltd., introduced credit-card sized ECG monitors SanketLife, which measures ECG in 15 seconds. This twelve-lead small ECG device contains a Bluetooth-based circuit that connects to smartphones or tablets, and results can be sent instantly via email, social media platforms, or SMS for information or medical consultation and is priced at Rs 2500. Utility of such devices increase significantly in epidemic- or pandemic-like situations like the Covid-19 pandemic, which forced millions to remain confined to homes for extended periods.All cheaper and affordable products or services do not necessarily imply recourse to frugal technology. Developing an affordable version of a product using cheaper/inferior components, or a less efficient technology might prove to be a ‘penny wise, pound foolish’ substitute. In the case of frugal innovation, there is no compromise on technological parameters and this aspect is of utmost importance. More often than not, frugal technology takes years of continuous research, experimentation, successive improvements over the original innovation, many rejections or partial acceptance of the technology by consumers, multidisciplinary collaborations and partnership between many stakeholders before it reaches an acceptable stage. But once it clears all the hurdles, it not only results in a product that is commercially successful, but also brings in due recognition to the innovator. And above all, it reinforces the argument of application of scientific approach in development of frugal innovations. Often in scientific research, the primary objective is to find a viable solution to a problem and develop a technology with specific criteria. However, after achieving the primary goal, and anticipating its potential use in everyday life, researchers work to bring down the cost of the technology by various substitutions, alterations and optimization to make it a commercial success.A recent example shows the evolution of an innovation, which was founded on an excellent technology and resulted in a frugal product that made an enormous impact on the lives of the people worldwide. The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences conferred the Nobel Prize 2019 in Chemistry to the trio of John B. Goodenough (University of Texas, Austin, US), M. Stanley Whittingham (Binghamton University, US) and Akira Yoshino (Asahi Kasei Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) for their extraordinary contributions for over three decades in innovating the versatile rechargeable and powerful lithium ion (Li-on) batteries. These batteries have changed our lifestyle to such an extent that imagining a world without them is difficult today. More importantly, this vital innovation is affordable even to people at the BOP. Li-ion batteries have actually made the success of many more innovations possible. These batteries are literally at the heart of mobile phones, laptops, e-vehicles and spacecraft. These batteries are not only lightweight, but also capable of storing significant amounts of energy even from solar and wind power, promising a world free of fosil fuel.The Journey of a BatteryIn the 1970s, Stanley Whittingham discovered a highly energy-rich material, titanium disulphide, and used it as a cathode along with metallic li as anode. The 2-volt battery thus developed had great potential but was not safe for mass use. John Goodenough predicted that the cathode would have greater application if a metal oxide were used in place of metal sulphide. In the 1980s, he demonstrated that cobalt oxide with intercalated Li-ions could produce as much as 4v. Based on these, Akira Yoshino created the first commercially viable Li-ion batteries in 1985 using cobalt oxide as cathode and petroleum jelly as anode, both having intercalated Li ions. After many years of research, development, testing and validation, Li-ion batteries entered the market in 1991. But research continues till today for subsequent improvement in terms of storage life, efficiency, safety, environment protection and cost reduction.Excerpted from The Art and Science of Frugal Innovation by Malavika Dadlani, Anil Wali and Kaushik Mukerjee with permission from Penguin Random House India.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/trends/features/book-excerpt-the-art-and-science-of-frugal-innovation-by-malavika-dadlani-anil-wali-and-kaushik-mukerjee-8341201.html,Research,"Similarly, the role of scientific interventions in the innovation of a frugal technology may not be very evident in all cases but, their importance in making successful innovations, be it a rotavirus vaccine, dengue detection kit, Lab in a Box or a super basmati rice variety, in one shot or in incremental steps, cannot be undermined.What makes an innovation a success or a failure?In order to answer this, we need to understand some fundamental matters.However, after achieving the primary goal, and anticipating its potential use in everyday life, researchers work to bring down the cost of the technology by various substitutions, alterations and optimization to make it a commercial success.A recent example shows the evolution of an innovation, which was founded on an excellent technology and resulted in a frugal product that made an enormous impact on the lives of the people worldwide.",[],[]
Is there a thing called 'risk-mitigated innovation' for SMEs?,02 April,"Risk-mitigated innovation? Isn’t that an oxymoron? Higher the risk, higher the return is what your stockbroker would have told you when you first started investing.This apothegm is also applicable to enterprises that believe in innovation. There is no such thing as risk-free innovation. If you are disrupting something, it will indeed come with major risks, depending on the scale of disruption you are envisaging. Successful organisations have all taken that big leap of faith. Examples aplenty: From Google to Apple, Whatsapp to Instagram. In India we play it safe and see frugal innovation only. We are not into radical innovation at all. Yet, there are methodologies available for mitigating the risk similar to options trading in stock markets.The chairman of one of the most innovative companies in the consumer products industry, P&G (the company that launched the first shampoo, shampoo with conditioner, skin-friendly soap, etc), had famously stated that he would always worry when more than 60 percent of new ideas succeed. What he meant was that executives were playing too safe. When it comes to innovation, it is not a question of eliminating all risks, but it is all about alleviating, and providing for, some risks.My work with the world’s no.1 innovation guru Rita McGrath has given me some unique insights on the way innovation works in India in comparison with what is best in the world. What most companies resort to here for alleviating risk is diversifying. Most companies we work with categorise growth projects into incremental, breakthrough and transformational with the time frame ranging from one to five years. We believe this is not a good route to driving innovation. To make innovation a way of life in an organisation, companies should take a holistic view of innovation (and risks thereof) and plan to mitigate the risk. Risk not just of financial kind; of every kind. Critical to innovation success is the balance a company takes between current business and growth plans. Culture, diversity and other factors are to be considered in this plan. What’s more, one needs to work on more than five initiatives to give a better success rate and at lower costs. We often use an opportunity portfolio akin to investment portfolio to navigate the innovation route for a company.There are many ways SMEs can take to mitigate risks. These include customer co-created innovation, application of Medici Effect and intersectional thinking, systematic funding and resource allocation, risk sharing with partners, 'Think Wrong' framework and Design Thinking, options and discovery driven planning and so on. Customer-driven innovation is gaining currency fast today because it involves the most important stakeholder in the process. Hotels to airlines and aircraft makers resort to this. Boeing’s new plane was the result of over 120,000-strong design team from all over the world – not just from within Boeing. It is a win-win for all as customers are investing in something that will offer them more value, and companies will improve the product offering to suit what the end-user needs.Another important aspect is the involvement and commitment of senior management or promoters. For a leading bank, which has achieved hall of fame status for its innovation processes, this commitment has delivered major benefits. They have an innovation council that monitors all initiatives and the director-level executive allocates resources based on pre-set criteria. Not allocating enough resources and not monitoring regularly can hamper the success rate – Learnings for SMEs.An FMCG client looked at resourcing in a slightly different way. Operations groups invite and identify a few ideas for seed funding internally every year. The steps in innovation process are followed and at every stage, depending on the success, resources are allocated as per plan. They were able to eliminate huge investments by allowing smaller and quicker testing and prototyping.For a leading insurance client, we deployed Medici Effect, helping their 10 project teams acquire as much diversity as feasible to identify 10 possible strategic initiatives. These teams worked without any additional resources, and within three to five months we were able to help the top management decide and fund six of these initiatives that showed major potential. By doing so the funds were allocated more strategically without diluting the creative passion. This approach also allowed individual freedom and access to other resources along with a loose structure.Innovation risk can be mitigated also through sharing costs. Partners should have strategic objectives and values matched for this. A laptop for every child was an idea our government touted to get votes. The sub-Rs 10,000 tablets caught on fast despite its poor performance. However, partnerships with Chinese vendors brought in some flak for the same.Eventually, the success of a business strategy is determined by revenue and profitability. Innovation when done right will help gain competitive advantage. With methods that can reduce the risks of innovation, it is possible for SMEs to drive major changes in India. The challenge is about changing mindsets.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/is-there-a-thing-called-risk-mitigated-innovation-for-smes-8297591.html,Research,"Yet, there are methodologies available for mitigating the risk similar to options trading in stock markets.The chairman of one of the most innovative companies in the consumer products industry, P&G (the company that launched the first shampoo, shampoo with conditioner, skin-friendly soap, etc), had famously stated that he would always worry when more than 60 percent of new ideas succeed.When it comes to innovation, it is not a question of eliminating all risks, but it is all about alleviating, and providing for, some risks.My work with the world’s no.1 innovation guru Rita McGrath has given me some unique insights on the way innovation works in India in comparison with what is best in the world.",['P&G'],[]

'The India Way': What makes Indians successful corporate leaders?,11 December,"If German political economist and historian Max Weber were alive today, he would be baffled by the growing trend of Indians rising to the top at leading global multinationals.Writing in the early 20th century, Weber had argued that the system of beliefs and rules of conduct around otherworldliness and salvation prevalent in India worked against the spirit of capitalism. This was in contrast to what he posited as the necessary ingredients of capitalism: hard work and not seeing profit as a sin, quite the opposite of the beliefs many Indians held.Today, of course, we aren’t just dealing with 20th century merchants and capitalists but also entrepreneurs, management gurus, CEOs who were born and raised (for most of their formative years at least) in India, and are now at the helm of some of the biggest global enterprises in the world, particularly in the US.The latest entrant in this long and illustrious list is Parag Agrawal, who succeeded Jack Dorsey as the CEO of social microblogging website Twitter, in late November.What are Indians doing differently that helps them succeed? The short answer is: they follow a set of principles unique to them, shaped by culture, beyond the simplistic labelling of leaders, who now have a global presence, based on their pedigree or nationalities. Let me explain.As economies evolve in a globalised world, a deepening interest has been to analyse management practices within a framework of individuals who perceive the world through cognitive lenses that are - to a great extent - drawn from their culture and partly derived from their own experiences.These perceptions and experiences could be a set of informal rules, cultural beliefs, social structures, and organisations that shape individual values that then inform managerial practices, leadership styles and organisational cultures.Specific to the context of Indians, this could translate to the norms and values within and outside of organisations that prioritise people first and guide employees and leaders in the absence of rules and absence of supervision.Much like capitalism in India through most of the 18th and 19th centuries, when community ties, interpersonal trust and networks made up for the absence of formal institutions and helped businesses thrive, the focus on culture and family continues to persist in so many ways, as researched widely.How this shapes leadership has been painstakingly elaborated in The India Way: How India's Top Business Leaders Are Revolutionizing Management, a 2010 book by Wharton academics Peter Cappelli, Harbir Singh, Jitendra Singh and Michael Useem.Interviewing hundreds of top business leaders from India soon after the terror attacks in India’s financial capital Mumbai in 2008, the authors found that India’s top companies had sprung back in record time and were back to scoring remarkable successes.They found that instead of adopting management practices that dominate Western businesses, Indian business leaders had innovated their own ways of doing business in every possible way, right from strategy to leadership, talent and organisational culture.The India Way – the set of distinct principles, shaped by culture - distinctly looks beyond stockholders’ interests and commits itself to public mission and national purpose. It draws on improvisation, adaptation, and resilience to overcome hurdles, and identifies products and services of compelling value to customers. Core to this is also a dogged investment in talent by business leaders, and seeing their leadership as an extension of commitment usually equal to family in India.My close brush with this set of principles was in 2015 when I was hired by the CEO of a digital real estate company to lead their content and communications wing. The start-up is now India’s largest player in real estate ecommerce. In the freewheeling interview, I was asked several questions about my family background and my childhood. It was clear the CEO wanted to get to the root of what drives me. I felt heard, seen, and valued, and joined the company without a doubt about the future of the company or its culture.The cornerstones of The India Way of doing business are exemplfied in the working styles of several India-born CEOs of global MNCs today.Cappelli et al, for instance, explain how these innovations work within Indian companies, identifying those likely to remain indigenous and those that can be adapted to the Western context.The question to ask here is, have the set of norms and beliefs that dictated Indian business and leadership prior to the 1990s undergone a change or evolved when the Indian economy globalised, particularly the IT industry? In what ways do the norms continue to shape the companies, their management and ownership?Some new norms and practices are evident, partly brought about by the rapid digital transformation of economies. Take, for example, Ganesh Ayyar, India-born EVP and President Digital Operations at Cognizant. In 2009, shortly before taking over as CEO of Mphasis, Ayyar asked himself if he was fit enough to lead a tech company into future. To start with, he learnt how to use Facebook from his juniors. What began as a Facebook lesson led to more learnings, setting off a chain of mind mapping in constant change and reinventing, adaptability, and growth.  In the process, Ayyar had to discard ego, ignorance, and fear of failure and commit to building a company culture that welcomed learning and innovation from all corners of the company.Co-opting or co-creating with customers and colleagues, this seemed to be the central message in Agrawal’s letter to his colleagues at Twitter after his elevation to CEO was announced. Describing Parag, Dorsey’s letter constantly referred to not only the collective ability of Twitter employees, but he also referred to Parag’s ability to give his ""heart and soul"" to his work.A flurry of news reports with interviews of his professors at IIT Bombay where he studied computer engineering described him as ""hard working"" and dedicated right from the start. On Twitter, Agrawal’s cover photo suggests a family festival scene while bio links to Twitter handles of his wife and son, what most of us call ""family"". Parag Agrawal, 37, holds a PhD in computer science from Stanford University and a bachelor's degree in computer science and engineering from Indian Institute of Technology Bombay.Hard work doesn’t put him far from the protestant ethic of Weber, but heart and soul and family are distinctly The India Way.In the end, there is lots to think about. Has the Indian way of working and life evolved with globalisation post the 1990s? In what specific ways is this change shaped by globalisation itself? How are these changes, if at all, visible and distinct?It’s time to snap out of fixed definitions or ways of looking at India-born business leaders, and to probe deeper to see what has changed and what persists. This has important lessons for leadership, management and innovation for companies around the world.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/trends/features/the-india-way-what-makes-indians-successful-business-leaders-7815251.html,Research,"Let me explain.As economies evolve in a globalised world, a deepening interest has been to analyse management practices within a framework of individuals who perceive the world through cognitive lenses that are - to a great extent - drawn from their culture and partly derived from their own experiences.These perceptions and experiences could be a set of informal rules, cultural beliefs, social structures, and organisations that shape individual values that then inform managerial practices, leadership styles and organisational cultures.Specific to the context of Indians, this could translate to the norms and values within and outside of organisations that prioritise people first and guide employees and leaders in the absence of rules and absence of supervision.Much like capitalism in India through most of the 18th and 19th centuries, when community ties, interpersonal trust and networks made up for the absence of formal institutions and helped businesses thrive, the focus on culture and family continues to persist in so many ways, as researched widely.How this shapes leadership has been painstakingly elaborated in The India Way: How India's Top Business Leaders Are Revolutionizing Management, a 2010 book by Wharton academics Peter Cappelli, Harbir Singh, Jitendra Singh and Michael Useem.Interviewing hundreds of top business leaders from India soon after the terror attacks in India’s financial capital Mumbai in 2008, the authors found that India’s top companies had sprung back in record time and were back to scoring remarkable successes.They found that instead of adopting management practices that dominate Western businesses, Indian business leaders had innovated their own ways of doing business in every possible way, right from strategy to leadership, talent and organisational culture.The India Way – the set of distinct principles, shaped by culture - distinctly looks beyond stockholders’ interests and commits itself to public mission and national purpose.I felt heard, seen, and valued, and joined the company without a doubt about the future of the company or its culture.The cornerstones of The India Way of doing business are exemplfied in the working styles of several India-born CEOs of global MNCs today.Cappelli et al, for instance, explain how these innovations work within Indian companies, identifying those likely to remain indigenous and those that can be adapted to the Western context.The question to ask here is, have the set of norms and beliefs that dictated Indian business and leadership prior to the 1990s undergone a change or evolved when the Indian economy globalised, particularly the IT industry?",['Top Business Leaders Are Revolutionizing Management'],[]
Corporate India’s culture is a bit servile. That acts against spirit of innovation,11 December,"Kanishka Sinha is a managing partner at Stillwater Consulting, which specializes in the areas of leadership development and executive coaching. He was earlier a professor of communication and ethics at the Indian School of Business (ISB).In an interview, Sinha talks to Moneycontrol about the importance of innovation and original thinking, learning from different global leadership styles, the baggage of humility and lack of corporate opinion in the Indian context. Excerpts:Indian corporate leaders are now receiving a lot of attention from the West with a whole host of American companies appointing people of Indian-origin as CEOs. But within India, we still follow a very conservative leadership style in most corporate houses. Even many of the start-ups are difficult places to work in, due to the eccentric styles of the founders. So, is it that Indian leaders changes their leadership stripes when they move abroad? Not just India, but Thailand, Malaysia, and some other countries including China have similar sort of corporate leadership styles. So, I would call this an Asian culture of working than an Indian style.The Asian culture of working is typically hierarchical and hardworking, with comparatively less freedom or free time. Europe is different in the sense that employees are less likely to get disturbed by the management on weekends, you have the freedom to wind up before 6 pm and do not have to wait till the boss goes home. Europe has employee welfare, a more socialistic approach and respect for free time like in France. The US culture has a mix of both in the sense that there is freedom but people also work very hard and put in long hours in a traditional capitalist style.Even within India, the leadership approach varies in different industries, depending on the kind of people and their backgrounds. At HUL, BCG or McKinsey, where premier B-school folks go, they have a flat hierarchy, they are happy to call the CEOs by their first name. There is no sir or mister attached. But that kind of a flat hierarchy would change in businesses where profitability can be increased by sales executives or delivery personnel working exhaustingly long hours. In some of the bigger multinational firms, employees are not berated in public in the same way. In fact, in some of those firms there is not enough useful direct feedback because they fear employee demotivation or even attrition. In summary, Indian work culture is similar to Asia and the leadership style depends on the nature of the industry.Why are leadership styles so decidedly different across continents? Is it so tough for Indian corporate leaders to adopt the best global best practices?Work in America is more on the creative side. If you take Apple or Facebook or Google, people are constantly working on new, disruptive ideas. They are seen as artists. They will not stay and will not hesitate to go work somewhere else if things don’t suit them. Work not done in those places comes home to India or China. Vast majority of Indian companies are doing work at a cheaper rate than international firms. A lot of the grunt low-level work is done by the Indian companies, who don’t create much new. We tend to take a success story from somewhere else and do it cheaper. Here it’s more about the cost differential. There is so much competition that if someone is not willing to do the work, there are many others who are waiting in line.Until we produce ground-breaking products that require intellectual work, we may not have requirements for disruptive, creative people. It’s also about where we are stand as an ecosystem.Our jobs offer little creativity. There seems to be no time to step back, innovate and improve the processes, so that we can offer differentiated services.Is Indian corporate leadership concentrating too much on the here and now, losing track of the bigger innovation picture?The big disparity of income, results in a unique rat race. In Europe, even if you are not employed, you still get your food or have a TV in your house, etc., whereas in India, you see that the migrants end up walking hundreds of kilometres back to their home states when they lose their jobs. It’s the same for countries like Bangladesh. Our jobs offer little creativity. There seems to be no time to step back, innovate and improve the processes, so that we can offer differentiated services. Unless we create that, we will still continue to depend on the price differential model.What qualities are required for Indian leaders to succeed during this pandemic stage? Corporate leaders seem to understand the value of empathetic leadership now. Or do they?That’s a good question. I think it’s about generating a bit of fun at work. Right now, everything looks a bit like life and death. Working late night at 3 am, you feel that if you lose this client that would be the end of it. Can we look to have a more cheerful way of working? It’s unlikely that the work will reduce, but at least the pressure can be eased. Bring in some humour into daily operations.It’s also good to have a ‘vision conversation’ with employees at the beginning of the year. Checking what is it that they want to achieve during the year from a health point of view, family point of view, etc. Can they be allowed to catch up over dinner with their family at least two days of the week, with their phones switched off? Can they leave office early on a Friday afternoon to go to the gym? Employees will appreciate all this in a big way. In our culture I think many of us have internalized a belief that if we don’t get a promotion this year, we are a failure.As a leadership coach, what leadership practices have most captured your attention as far Indian bosses are concerned? Indian leaders value coaching and mentoring. They are comfortable sharing their own wisdom and experiences, being the father figure, women leaders often like to find younger women to mentor. Sometimes, some of the bosses even give personal advice. In Europe that would be seen as interference or even disrespectful. Asking personal questions is seen as insensitive. In the US you see fewer people looking for a mentor. You are more likely to decide what’s best for you. So, there’s more independent thinking and very little mollycoddling. Here in India people find it hard to make decisions because you are looking to someone for guidance. This happens more at the middle level. They don’t make enough decisions on their own.Work-life balance is better in Europe but I can’t see that happening in India in the foreseeable future. In fact, it could get worse. Start-ups, IPOs, ESOPs, new opportunities to create wealth, sudden acceleration in the cash-in culture and the desire to retire early will make people work harder. I don’t see bosses doing anything that’s going to change that.What we really miss is the culture of innovation. It’s like 'I won’t give you something amazing but I’ll get it to you immediately’. Everyone is so eager to please the client. It’s a slightly servile culture. There is no push back, on clients or bosses.We do not have so many Nobel Prize winners per capita like Israel. If we could shift the needle on those numbers, that would really be something.We don’t appreciate certain personality types, do we? Imagine a Steve Jobs or Elon Musk in our midst. Chances are that such personalities may get immediately curtailed or dragged down. In the US you don’t see an attitude of servitude among their tech superstars or corporate chieftains. In India you hear about the CEO of a firm or a movie star being talked about like he’s so big yet so humble. There is a desire to allocate this label of humility. No one goes around saying Elon Musk or Jeff Bezos is so humble. What matters is that they are innovative and have a point of view. Here, no public or corporate figures can give political statements, and if they do, then they will lose their credibility, sponsors, etc. There is pressure to conform and that’s true of our organisations as well. I don’t really like it. A famous person may have gold-plated bathtubs at home but would still want to say that he or she is humble. Which corporate leader makes impactful statements against political leadership here?In America, public and corporate figures are much more comfortable sharing their political and controversial views in public. Our corporate leaders would be fearful of speaking their minds. Somewhere, I feel this might be having an effect on our inventive spirit. Many of our start-ups are implementing business models that originated elsewhere.Indian-origin CEOs are doing very well in the US. There seems to be something that is clicking for them. It’s excellent that we have 1.3 billion people and many of them want to be engineers! We are hardworking, driven to succeed, find solutions through jugaad, English-speaking and have the ability to think around corners to survive complexities. It’s like you are used to lifting 100kg here and over there in the US you are asked to lift 20kg. You feel like a superman over there, after being bred here in difficult circumstances. While I was growing up here in India, in a class of 50, I was in the 25th spot in studies. But the moment I moved to the UK, I became a topper in every subject. That said, we do not have so many Nobel Prize winners per capita like Israel. If we could shift the needle on those numbers, that would really be something.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/trends/features/corporate-indias-culture-is-a-bit-servile-that-acts-against-spirit-of-innovation-leadership-coach-kanishka-sinha-7813931.html,Research,"He was earlier a professor of communication and ethics at the Indian School of Business (ISB).In an interview, Sinha talks to Moneycontrol about the importance of innovation and original thinking, learning from different global leadership styles, the baggage of humility and lack of corporate opinion in the Indian context.The US culture has a mix of both in the sense that there is freedom but people also work very hard and put in long hours in a traditional capitalist style.Even within India, the leadership approach varies in different industries, depending on the kind of people and their backgrounds.","['the Indian School of Business (', 'Moneycontrol']",[]

Tokyo Olympics | A short history of timekeeping at the Games,24 July,"The story of timekeeping at the Olympics is mostly a story of Swiss domination and precision, but it is also marked by periods when the Japanese took over timekeeping duties.As the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, delayed for over a year by the coronavirus pandemic, gets underway, we take a look at the various innovations the Games have sparked.The early years: Back in the day, and by that we mean the first five editions of the Summer Olympics until 1912, timekeeping was an amateurish affair. Judges of various sporting events actually used their own stopwatches — from different brands — to decide the winners.Quite naturally, that created a host of issues, and so, in 1920, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) asked Heuer (now Tag Heuer) to handle timekeeping duties, and that’s how the Mikrograph Pocket Chronometer was born.According to the Fondation de la Haute Horlogerie, which promotes watchmaking excellence globally, the Mikrograph was the world’s first mechanical stopwatch accurate to 1/100th of a second as opposed to other timing instruments of the time which could only measure to the nearest fifth of a second.Omega and the Olympics: The Tokyo Olympics marks the 29th time Omega will serve as the official timekeeper of the Games. The Swiss watchmaker’s association with the Olympics started in 1932 when a staffer arrived in Los Angeles with 30 split-second chronographs.In Tokyo this year, Omega will keep a close eye on— and record — 339 events in 33 sports. To enable it to do that, the watchmaker has carted over 450 tonnes of equipment, installed 250 km of cables and optical fibre, and is supported by 530 timekeepers. This year is the 29th time that Omega is the official timekeeper for the Olympics. Over 500 timekeepers and 450 tonnes of equipment have been deployed for Tokyo 2020.Over the years, the company has introduced the Games — and the world — to the first photofinish camera as well as first Photoelectric Cell, which electronically stopped the clock as the first athlete crossed the finish line (1948, London); the Omegascope technology that heralded ‘real time’ sports reporting to television viewers by superimposing live times of athletes on the bottom of the screen (1964, Innsbruck, IX Olympic Winter Games); and motion sensor and positioning systems that delivered continuous measurements of athletes’ performance from start to finish.It also developed the electronic starting pistol that has replaced the traditional starting pistol; athletics starting blocks equipped with sensors to detect false starts; and the Scan ‘O’ Vision Myria, a photofinish camera that can record up to 10,000 digital images per second.Between 1996 and 2004, Omega’s parent company, Swatch Group, entrusted some of the other brands in its stable such as Longines with timekeeping duties. That, though, was not the only period when Omega was not present at the Games.Seiko and the Olympics: The 1964 Olympic Games in Tokyo, the first Games to be held in Asia, saw Seiko act as the official timekeeper. Seiko, which would go on to mark time at, among others, the 1972 Sapporo Winter Games and the 1992 Barcelona Olympics, developed several innovations. These included the world’s first quartz watch, Astron, in 1969.The 1964 Games also saw the company launch the Crown Chronograph, Japan’s first watch with a stopwatch function.The watchmaker recently launched a new collection that pays homage to the Crown Chronograph. Named Style60’s, the series, part of the Presage range, features two timepieces that feature the the Crown Chronograph's box-shaped glass, faceted indexes, and sharp hand designs.

"Wockhardt, RPG Life Sciences MDs bat for innovation to drive growth in pharma industry",29 April,"At a time when the development and distribution of an effective vaccine against COVID-19 pandemic is paramount to save humanity, the managing directors of  Wockhardt Ltd and RPG Life Sciences Ltd have emphasised the need for innovation in the pharmaceutical industry to drive growth.At IMC Indo-US Partnership Vision Summit, Yugal Sikri, MD of RPG Life Sciences and Murtaza Khorakiwala, MD of Wockhardt, said that innovation is the lifeblood of the pharmaceutical industry and is extremely important to drive growth in the sector.Murtaza Khorakiwala said that innovation in collaborations between India and the US is very important to find solutions for the COVID-19 pandemic.He also said that Wockhardt is currently working on developing novel antibiotics to address antibiotics resistance as a number of diseases have become resistant to them.Khorakiwala said there is an urgent need to develop new antibiotics to avoid a pandemic-like scenario in the future.COVID-19 VaccineFrequently Asked QuestionsA vaccine works by mimicking a natural infection. A vaccine not only induces immune response to protect people from any future COVID-19 infection, but also helps quickly build herd immunity to put an end to the pandemic. Herd immunity occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population becomes immune to a disease, making the spread of disease from person to person unlikely. The good news is that SARS-CoV-2 virus has been fairly stable, which increases the viability of a vaccine.There are broadly four types of vaccine — one, a vaccine based on the whole virus (this could be either inactivated, or an attenuated [weakened] virus vaccine); two, a non-replicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of SARS-CoV; three, nucleic-acid vaccines that have genetic material like DNA and RNA of antigens like spike protein given to a person, helping  human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine; and four, protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombinant proteins of SARS-COV-2 along with an adjuvant (booster) is given as a vaccine.Vaccine development is a long, complex process. Unlike drugs that are given to people with a diseased, vaccines are given to healthy people and also vulnerable sections such as children, pregnant women and the elderly. So rigorous tests are compulsory. History says that the fastest time it took to develop a vaccine is five years, but it usually takes double or sometimes triple that time.Yugal Sikri also emphasised the importance of universal health coverage for India and said that the country should use innovation to provide universal healthcare to its citizens.Sikri also stressed on the importance of India's partnership with the US to bring about innovation in the country's healthcare system.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/trends/wockhardt-rpg-life-sciences-mds-say-innovation-key-to-drive-growth-in-pharma-industry-6833731.html,Research,"At a time when the development and distribution of an effective vaccine against COVID-19 pandemic is paramount to save humanity, the managing directors of  Wockhardt Ltd and RPG Life Sciences Ltd have emphasised the need for innovation in the pharmaceutical industry to drive growth.At IMC Indo-US Partnership Vision Summit, Yugal Sikri, MD of RPG Life Sciences and Murtaza Khorakiwala, MD of Wockhardt, said that innovation is the lifeblood of the pharmaceutical industry and is extremely important to drive growth in the sector.Murtaza Khorakiwala said that innovation in collaborations between India and the US is very important to find solutions for the COVID-19 pandemic.He also said that Wockhardt is currently working on developing novel antibiotics to address antibiotics resistance as a number of diseases have become resistant to them.Khorakiwala said there is an urgent need to develop new antibiotics to avoid a pandemic-like scenario in the future.COVID-19 VaccineFrequently Asked QuestionsA vaccine works by mimicking a natural infection.The good news is that SARS-CoV-2 virus has been fairly stable, which increases the viability of a vaccine.There are broadly four types of vaccine — one, a vaccine based on the whole virus (this could be either inactivated, or an attenuated [weakened] virus vaccine); two, a non-replicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of SARS-CoV; three, nucleic-acid vaccines that have genetic material like DNA and RNA of antigens like spike protein given to a person, helping  human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine; and four, protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombinant proteins of SARS-COV-2 along with an adjuvant (booster) is given as a vaccine.Vaccine development is a long, complex process.","['COVID-19', 'Wockhardt Ltd', 'RPG Life Sciences Ltd', 'IMC Indo-US Partnership Vision Summit', 'RPG Life Sciences', 'COVID-19', 'RNA']",[]
India needs its moonshot diviners,25 April,"Elon Musk had an overriding obsession, to colonize Mars. He even said he would like to die on it. And last week, when NASA selected his start-up SpaceX to take astronauts to the moon, Musk’s 20-year-old moonshot could be said to have had paid off.Musk is only the latest in a long line of dreamers who have dared to chase the impossible. Christopher Columbus set out to discover India and ended up finding America. Louis Pasteur, Alexander Fleming, Thomas Edison, our very own C.V. Raman and Srinivasa Ramanujan, all these were people whose reach, in the words of poet Robert Browning, exceeded their grasp.We call their endeavours moonshots after the Apollo 11 spaceflight project in 1969 which landed the first human on the moon. They define the best companies and the best individuals. With one such long shot, Steve Jobs revolutionized music. Today, Apple, the company he founded, is working on an electric car. At Google, such was the passion for moonshots shared by its enigmatic founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin that they eventually set up an enterprise called X, the moonshot factory, to institutionalize what they had been doing randomly, chasing projects like Calico, a company which effectively aimed at curing death or flying cars dubbed electric vertical takeoff and landing vehicles (eVTOLs).Of course, every dream is not a moonshot. In fact, very few are and not because they aren’t visionary enough but because there’s no will to pursue them beyond the idea stage. Behind every successful moonshot is grind, frustration, anxiety and tenacity.Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla in a recent Harvard Business Review article called the development of the company’s acclaimed vaccine for Covid-19 the result of a “moon-shot challenge”.  He explains: “On March 19, 2020, as Covid-19 swept across the world, I challenged everyone at Pfizer to 'make the impossible possible': to develop a vaccine more quickly than anyone ever had before.” At the time in March 2020 that Pfizer got into partnership with BioNTech, which had already developed several candidates to be tested, no mRNA vaccines had ever been approved for clinical use.In November, barely nine months later, the Pfizer-BioNtech vaccine was cleared for emergency use. For context, the typical vaccine development program can take up to 10 years to reach a similar stage.That’s really what the essence of a moonshot is. It isn’t doing something someone else has done but at lower cost. Nor is it incremental change. It is a child’s dream not an adult’s fancy.India has had a few world beaters but most of them have emerged through serendipity rather than from a plan. Thus, in 1981, seven young engineers, N.R. Narayana Murthy, Nandan Nilekani, N.S. Raghavan, S. Gopalakrishnan, S.D. Shibulal, K. Dinesh and Ashok Arora, quit their jobs and working out of Murthy’s living room in Pune, decided they could write software that would power the world’s most advanced applications. Their clients would be the world’s most powerful companies but they would service them out of India, then not even a speck on the world technology map. They were soon joined by others and an IT powerhouse was born, one that is today India’s best known calling card.But India needs other, mightier moonshots. Recent success in areas like pharma, biotech and IT gives us a great assessment of our globally competitive skills. Based on those, we need to define half a dozen moonshots and then chase them with all we have. Thus, if we have strengths in pharmaceuticals, becoming the vaccine supplier to the world can’t be enough of a goal. For one, it is too much of the low-hanging fruit and in turn it yields very little. Instead we must focus on two or three major diseases, and then put all our medical, pharmaceutical, technological might behind finding a cure for them. That would require a world-class research lab run by scientists and doctors, not bureaucrats, and the kind of financial backing that allowed Moderna to function for 10 years without the burden of showing any returns on the billions of dollars it had raised in the form of private capital and public funds.It is instructive to look at how X defines its moonshots, all of which sit at the intersection of three ingredients: a huge problem in the world that affects millions or billions of people; a radical, sci-fi sounding solution that may seem impossible today; a technology breakthrough that gives a glimmer of hope that the solution could be possible in the next 5-10 years.How many Indian projects do you think meet these three criteria?",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/trends/features/india-needs-its-moonshot-diviners-6811861.html,Research,"He explains: “On March 19, 2020, as Covid-19 swept across the world, I challenged everyone at Pfizer to 'make the impossible possible': to develop a vaccine more quickly than anyone ever had before.” At the time in March 2020 that Pfizer got into partnership with BioNTech, which had already developed several candidates to be tested, no mRNA vaccines had ever been approved for clinical use.In November, barely nine months later, the Pfizer-BioNtech vaccine was cleared for emergency use.That would require a world-class research lab run by scientists and doctors, not bureaucrats, and the kind of financial backing that allowed Moderna to function for 10 years without the burden of showing any returns on the billions of dollars it had raised in the form of private capital and public funds.It is instructive to look at how X defines its moonshots, all of which sit at the intersection of three ingredients: a huge problem in the world that affects millions or billions of people; a radical, sci-fi sounding solution that may seem impossible today; a technology breakthrough that gives a glimmer of hope that the solution could be possible in the next 5-10 years.How many Indian projects do you think meet these three criteria?","['Covid-19', 'Pfizer', 'Pfizer', 'Pfizer', 'sci-fi']","['the billions of dollars', 'millions or billions']"
Self-propelled railway track scavenging vehicle may soon replace manual scavenging at railway tracks,05 April,"A self-propelled railway track scavenging vehicle is set to replace manual scavenging on railway tracks soon, the Ministry of Science and Technology has said on April 5.According to a statement, Dr. Sharad K. Pradhan, Associate Professor, Department of Mechanical Engineering, National Institute of Technical Teachers’ Training and Research (NITTTR), Bhopal, has developed a Multifunctional Railway Track Scavenging Vehicle.This vehicle is equipped with dry and wet suction systems, air and water spraying nozzles, control system, and road cum rail attachment that will only require one other person along with a driver to carry out automatic cleaning of railway tracks.""Despite the ban on manual scavenging since 1993 in our country, men and women are seen removing excreta on the tracks with brooms and metal plates,"" the Ministry said.Describing the manual scavenging process, it explained that once the garbage is picked up from the tracks, night soil, excessive dirt, oil, and other foreign materials are ineffectively cleaned with high-pressure water jets.How does it work?With this device, once the dry and wet suction is complete, the water nozzles start spraying water jets to clear off any human waste or semi-solid garbage present on the track floor.These water jets will also completely remove human waste and other wet garbage from the interrail space zone.""Both dry and wet garbage is collected in different tanks, and once filled, it can be decanted at an appropriate local municipal garbage collection point,"" the Ministry said.It is also equipped with a telescoping suction pipe that can easily be placed at appropriate position in the side trench to suck the sewage slurry.As this device will be equipped for both railway and road, it can be used as a material/ garbage transport vehicle from track to the road by the Indian Railways.""In non scavenging mode, it can also be used as a transportation and inspection vehicle by Indian Railways.

In fact, Berlin stands among the top three entrepreneurial hotspots in Europe (together with London and Paris) in terms of number of financing rounds and volume.However, COVID-19 has had a wide-spread effect: a survey found that 91.1 percent of German startups’ business activities have been affected and among those, 69.7 percent foresee their existence threatened within the next six months unless measures are taken. Given the tremendous potential of startups for fostering innovation and generating employment, it is imperative that actors in the startup ecosystem and the government find smart ways to help them navigate successfully through the crisis.In the wake of the pandemic, startups shall need to reshuffle their business activities and daily working routines to comply with measures by the government and health authorities. These, combined with a fall in consumer demand due to high economic uncertainty, are expected to lead to a decline in revenue. Startups, especially early-stage ones, tend to have low financial reserves and find it hard to secure loans from banks. Professional venture capital investors play an important role in financing startups, but the volatile economic environment has led them to focus on supporting their current portfolio companies. They are taking a very selective approach towards new investments, leading to an expected 46 percent drop in the number of deals in the second quarter of 2020. Therefore, the pandemic can plunge even competitive start-up enterprises into an existential crisis.How shall they survive? First, it is clear that only the fittest and most resilient — those which are flexible and find ways to adapt to the new circumstances — shall make it. This will require startups to reflect on their business models, evaluate where changes are necessary, and act accordingly. Cutting expenses will be inevitable in many cases, but they can also be proactive by, for instance, extending their offering or finding new channels of distribution.COVID-19 VaccineFrequently Asked QuestionsA vaccine works by mimicking a natural infection. A vaccine not only induces immune response to protect people from any future COVID-19 infection, but also helps quickly build herd immunity to put an end to the pandemic. Herd immunity occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population becomes immune to a disease, making the spread of disease from person to person unlikely. The good news is that SARS-CoV-2 virus has been fairly stable, which increases the viability of a vaccine.There are broadly four types of vaccine — one, a vaccine based on the whole virus (this could be either inactivated, or an attenuated [weakened] virus vaccine); two, a non-replicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of SARS-CoV; three, nucleic-acid vaccines that have genetic material like DNA and RNA of antigens like spike protein given to a person, helping  human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine; and four, protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombinant proteins of SARS-COV-2 along with an adjuvant (booster) is given as a vaccine.Vaccine development is a long, complex process. Unlike drugs that are given to people with a diseased, vaccines are given to healthy people and also vulnerable sections such as children, pregnant women and the elderly. So rigorous tests are compulsory. History says that the fastest time it took to develop a vaccine is five years, but it usually takes double or sometimes triple that time.Further support must come from other actors in the ecosystem. The provision of office space or rooms to host events is one key element of startup support, but less relevant in a time when most are working from home. However, startup-support organisations, such as incubators and accelerators, can reach out to their clients and organise virtual get-togethers. These can facilitate peer-to-peer learning between startups, which is crucial in a time of unprecedented challenges. A second key element of startup support is business advice. To that end, support organisations and investors can gather and share relevant information and best practices, or connect them to external experts. Startups can be mentored through calls and webinars. A third element of startup support is the provision of funding and assistance with fundraising, but this is currently insufficient, due to cautious investor sentiment.Therefore, the COVID-19 pandemic has prompted policy responses from German federal and state governments. In April, the federal government announced a 2 billion Euro relief package specifically targeted to startups, resting on two pillars. The first pillar is called the ‘Corona Matching Facility’, whereby investment subsidiaries of State-owned development banks (i.e. KfW Capital, IBB Beteiligungsgesellschaft) and the European Investment Bank offer venture capital investors the opportunity to co-invest. In order to ensure continued funding for promising startups, investments are topped up with public funding by up to 70 percent of the value of a financial round. The instrument is based on the idea that investors, based on their in-depth market expertise, can best determine which investments are worthwhile. In return, public investment bodies receive convertible loans (Wandeldarlehen), whereby they can benefit from expected increases in value later.The second pillar addresses startups which are not financed through venture capital and thus have no access to the matching facility. In collaboration with State institutions (in particular, State-owned development banks), the federal government provides money via loans to expand existing initiatives such as Berlin’s ‘GründungsBONUS’ and ‘Start-up Stipend’ programmes. The eligibility criteria of the first programme have been relaxed and startups are granted advance payments and an additional Corona bonus of 5,000 Euro. The latter programme allocates funding to startups centres and incubators to extend their business support. Both focus on startups with technological innovations as well as those that promote ecological and charitable goals.In addition to the major package introduced by the federal government, Berlin has two further emergency aid programmes in place, which are also open to startups. They are administered through the State-owned Investitionsbank Berlin and their aim is to help companies overcome liquidity shortages caused by the pandemic. One programme provides SMEs with ‘Corona rescue loans’ that have a maximum value of 500,000 Euro and help them pay their rent, personnel expenses and other liabilities. The second programme allocates ‘Corona grants’ to self-employed people and smaller businesses. The amount of the grant, which aim to cover personnel costs and salaries as well as operational expenses, depends on the number of employees and lies in the range between 9,000 and 25,000 Euro.In addition to the policy responses injecting liquidity, many startups are using the short-time working instrument (Kurzarbeit) whereby employee working hours are reduced, while the government replaces some of the employees’ lost incomes. This is to avoid companies having to lay off their employees during the economic downturn.To sum up, the exchange of information and best practices, as well as the provision of liquidity are the most crucial elements of startup support during this time. Financial support must be tailored to the needs of different startups in order to be effective, and public funds should be provided in a targeted manner to help startups with promising business models. Thereby, the situation can be taken as an opportunity to specifically support startups, which develop social innovations and innovations that promote climate protection and sustainability.Ultimately, startups also have potential to contribute to fighting the pandemic, as the initiative ‘Startups against Corona’ (a crowdsourcing platform that connects incumbent firms as solution-seekers for Corona-related problems and startups as solution-providers) demonstrates.(This article appeared in the ORF)Sabrina Korreck is a Senior Fellow, Observer Research Foundation.

Innovations can present $20-30 bn biz opportunities for fashion industry every year: Study,23 January,"Innovations emerging in the fashion industry present unprecedented investment opportunities worth USD 20-30 billion annually, according to a new study conducted by the Boston Consulting Group (BCG) and Fashion for Good.Sustainability is at the top of the fashion industry's agenda, as leaders recognise the urgent need to move toward responsible practices under growing consumer and regulatory pressures, said the study, released here on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum's 50th Annual Meeting.A step change requires disruptive innovation in the form of new materials, processes, technologies, and business models, the study said, while underlining that the fashion industry has historically engaged in a cost-driven race to the bottom, giving little attention to radical new technologies.However, a perfect storm of innovation and opportunity is now forming, and investors as well as companies that can capitalise on sustainability and impact-driven innovation will transform the industry.The study calculates that transitioning toward sustainability yields a USD 20-30 billion financing opportunity per year to develop and scale disruptive innovations.The latter case requires innovation to emerge at a faster pace before 2030, which in turn calls for investments to increase by a factor of three or more over their current levels.With its USD 2 trillion market size, the fashion industry offers major untapped opportunities for investors and companies.

Podcast | Digging deeper - Ford now has a 'furniture guy' in charge of its smart mobility unit,20 March,"RIMA M. | RAKESH SHARMAMoneycontrol ContributorsThe path to good design is never a straight one. It is also hardly, if ever, predictable. But there is one thing that good design rests on – empathy. The foundation of great design thinking has always got to keep the end user in mind – you and me. Take the history of Ford design that we will explore later in this podcast. Or the latest development in the company that Forbes published with this headline, ""Why Ford Is Putting A Furniture Guy In Charge Of Its New 'Smart Mobility' Unit.""What would a “furniture guy” bring to an automotive giant? What are the benefits of out-of-the-box thinking? How does empathy improve user experience? And what can we learn from Ford’s latest move? These are the questions we will address on today’s edition of Digging Deeper with Moneycontrol with me Rakesh Sharma.A furniture executive in charge of mobility?Writer Joann Muller reported in a March 2019 Forbes piece that Ford Motor is forming a new subsidiary, Ford Smart Mobility LLC, based in Palo Alto, Calif., and that one of its directors, former Steelcase chief executive James Hackett, would step down from the board to lead the group.We quote, ""Putting a furniture executive in charge of mobility might seem like an oxymoron, but Hackett is recognized as an innovator in office space who helped change the way people work. During his 30 years at Steelcase, he helped transform the company from a traditional office furniture manufacturer to a designer of cutting-edge workspaces, shifting away from cubicles, for example, to an open space environment, giving employees the flexibility to work where they want."" The implication being that if a man can revolutionalise office ergonomics with delicious free-spiritedness, he sure as hell can tinker with car design.As for the man of the moment Hackett, he said and we quote, “I am absolutely thrilled to lead Ford’s mobility business into the future. Transportation in the world today is on the cusp of a major revolution, and Ford plans to lead the way by changing the way the world moves through Ford Smart Mobility.”What is Ford smart Mobility? We will find out in just a bit but first let us figure just who James Hackett is.James Hackett is a member of Ford's board of directors since 2013 and as Forbes informs, will report directly to Ford president and chief executive, Mark Fields, who as the piece says, is trying to channel Henry Ford to solve society's mobility problems. We quote, ""His strategy is to expand Ford's business model so that it can be both an automaker and a mobility services company.""That is where, says Forbes, the new subsidiary, Ford Smart Mobility, comes in to cement the company’s aspirations to be a leader in connectivity, mobility, autonomous vehicles, customer experience and data and analytics.It is easy now to see why Fields thinks Hackett is a good choice to lead both business development and design.In a statement Fields said, ""Ford Smart Mobility and expanding into mobility services are significant growth opportunities. Our plan is to quickly become part of the growing transportation services market, which already accounts for $5.4 trillion in annual revenue. Jim Hackett is the right visionary leader – with extensive experience in business development and design – to take us into the mobility services business in the future.”According to Forbes, the new company will work with existing product development, research and advanced engineering, marketing and data analytics teams and will also develop new mobility services and invest in promising mobility-related ventures. Ford Smart Mobility LLC will also design and build mobility services on its own, and collaborate with start-ups and tech companies.As Ford's executive chairman Bill Ford put it, the idea is that the new subsidiary will enable the development mobility solutions to address the rapidly changing transportation challenges. He said, ""Ensuring the freedom of mobility requires us to continually look beyond the needs of today and interpret what mobility will mean to future generations in an increasingly crowded world.”Ford's preoccupation with design as a purveyor of solutions is not new though. Neither is Ford's interest in unusual design picks.The roots of Ford designThe Ford Design Department was established as far back as in 1935 and was ideated by Henry Ford's son Edsel Ford, who wanted to wed function with form. The first designer hired by Edsel was E.T. “Bob” Gregorie, who had been a shipbuilder and who brought the “styling bridge,” a U-shaped structure that rode on a series of parallel rails. This helped with coordinates that could later be used on other car models, too. But cutting-edge design existed from the start, when in 1908, the Model T changed the automotive industry forever.The first vehicle from Ford Design put the spotlight on the design process: the Lincoln Zephyr in 1937 with its horizontal grille – something that remains on Lincoln vehicles today. Post the World War, the new 1949 Ford offered integrated fenders, chrome trim and aviation-reminiscent center grille design – all part of the luxuriant experience Ford was hoping to give its customers.The F-Series was pathbreaking thanks to its contours, integrated headlights, ability to tow and emphasis on cargo, since they’re the standard today.Ford has been leading new trends from the Thunderbird and Mustang to the Explorer and Focus Electric. Plus, the aluminum-alloy-bodied 2015 F-150 was a game-changer, although interesting materials used in Ford vehicles happened even back in 1941, with the Soybean Car, which was a plastic vehicle made of soybeans, flax and other natural elements! Whoever said organic was a recent trend!Unusual design interlopersWhile we will continue to explore the new role of James Hackett at Ford, let us also remember just how car design is no longer a sacrosanct space designated for trained design engineers. Remember when ex-spice girl turned fashion designer Victoria Beckham was invited to design the special edition Evoque VB launched in 2012? In July 2017 though, a big controversy erupted when some media outlets reported how Land Rover’s design director Gerry McGovern was angry with Victoria' s appropriation of undue credit. McGovern said that she had exaggerated the role she had played in designing the car by saying at its launch, ""I’ve designed a car that I want to drive, a car I think [husband] David wants to drive.”But McGovern – who did design the Evoque – told reporters that she had spoken out of turn because she hadn't designed the car. To be a car designer takes years, he said. Oops. Land Rover however said that the three-year project was completed in full by both parties and was a huge creative success around the world.If there is a discrepancy somewhere in the two stories, it just goes to show that today branding is almost as important as what is being branded and healthy sales figures are what everyone is after at the end of the day. But Ford's decision to use an erstwhile furniture whiz indicates its willingness to trust a designer to deliver not just profit but solutions in a world clamouring for them.An automobile design that thinks beyond automobiles?In a perceptive piece for The Atlantic, Jerry Useem connects the story of the American economy with the types of people who run its corporations. He associates the early days of mass production to mechanically minded men such as Henry Ford. After the conglomerate craze of the 1960s and ’70s, he says, almost a third of CEOs hailed from finance and accounting backgrounds. Then a crop of technologists, such as Andy Grove and Bill Gates, arrived. That is why, he says, that Ford Motor Company's choice of Hackett is unconventional because he is a chief executive who hadn’t been reared in Detroit and didn’t easily fit established CEO molds. He was a furniture maker. Jim Hackett, 63, says the piece, is a devotee of product development known as design thinking, which rigorously focuses on how the user experiences a product.He said, ""He forced Steelcase to think less about cubicles—its bread-and-butter product when he arrived—and more about the people inside them. Hiring anthropologists and sociologists and working closely with tech experts, he made Steelcase a pioneer in the team-oriented, open workspaces so common today. In effect, he transformed an office-supply company into a leader of the revolution in the way we work.”Is the leap of a furniture designer into automobiles far-fetched? The writer doesn't think so because he was at hand in the foam-and-aluminum cockpit of a self-driving-car prototype in one of Ford’s Dearborn design studios to witness how Hackett's mind works. There was a driver’s seat in the prototype that could  swivel around—like an office chair!As he says, ""The choice of Hackett to lead Ford confounded both those analysts who expected a dyed-in-the-wool carmaker and those who expected a high-tech hand to manage the company as cars morph into rolling computers. But his selection suggests a third way—which may, in fact, capture the times. We don’t live in the age of the automobile, or even the age of the computer. We live in the age of user experience."" Hackett thinks 90-button TV remotes are “Maddening” and he may bring his penchant for simplifying user experience to cars as well.The writer seem to agree as he goes on to explain, ""Our lives are made up of human-machine interactions—with smartphones, televisions, internet-enabled parking meters that don’t accept quarters— that have the power to delight and, often, infuriate. Into this arena has stepped a new class of professional: the user-experience, or UX, designer, whose job is to see a product not from an engineer’s, marketer’s, or legal department’s perspective but from the viewpoint of the user alone. And to insist that the customer should not have to learn to speak the company’s internal language. The company should learn to speak the customer’s.""Hackett in that respect is a game changer or rather an experience modifier. He did it once with office furniture and he can do it again with cars.The primacy of user experienceWith high-tech entrants such as Tesla and Google heating up the automobile market, the question is not whether they can learn about crankshafts and drivetrains faster than Ford or GM, or whether other carmakers can learn software and algorithms. Hackett, says Useem, is reflective of Ford’s bet that the winner won’t be the best chassis maker or software maker, but the company that nails the interaction between man and machine.As Bill Ford, the company’s executive chairman (and great-grandson of Henry), explained, “One of the things that drew me to Jim was his commitment to design thinking, which puts the human being at the center of the equation.""The term user experience or UX originated in Silicon Valley and the piece cites Don Norman, a UC San Diego professor and the author of the seminal book The Design of Everyday Things, to recall how Steve Jobs in a way exemplified this idea best when he put the consumer's interaction with an Apple product before what the marketing and engineering guys had to say.  After Jobs had left the company, Norman suggested to the then CEO John Scully in 1993, the need for “someone who took the overview of what it was like to use these machines.” He formed a UX office and styled himself as Apple’s user-experience architect, informs the piece.This affected design ideologies around the world.We quote, ""The migration of UX thinking to other industries was accelerated by the Palo Alto design outfit Ideo, whose founder, David Kelley, helped design the first Apple mouse. It counted Medtronic and Procter & Gamble among its first clients. In the early 1990s, a 30-something Hackett visited Ideo as Steelcase was thinking of entering a new market. He described his experience there as “so profound” that three years later, Steelcase bought a majority stake in the company—in part to get full-time access to Kelley through an always-on video link.""Hackett retired from Steelcase in 2014 and in 2016, informs the piece, Bill Ford hired him to run the automaker’s nascent Smart Mobility subsidiary, which was tasked with rethinking from the ground up how cars would be driven, powered, and owned. Once again, Hackett turned to Ideo. The company had already been working with Ford as a client, but Hackett embedded its employees in Dearborn to jump-start a transformation of Ford’s culture.Hackett told the writer,  “This is what we call the design gap,” pointing to the space between two lines on a graph he’d sketched on a whiteboard. We quote, ""One line ascends—this is a company’s skill at making things, which goes up over time. Below it is a descending line, representing a company’s understanding of the customer’s experience. This, Hackett said, can decline over time, as a company loses sight of the problems it’s in the business of solving. The design gap may be noticeable when the job is, say, building a marginally better tailgate for the Ford F‑150. But it becomes positively yawning when your industry is so thoroughly turned on its head that you’re forced to ask some basic questions: Do people want to own their cars or share them? Drive them or have them driven? The flood of new technologies makes everything possible.""How can purposeful design improve user experience?This is perhaps the right time to declutter the inane add ons that nobody needs like seats that monitor your heart rate! As the piece informs, overloading the dashboard with too many doodads requires the driver to do the hard thinking about what she needs while on the road and the same time, it burdens the company with producing all these options. Figuring out the right choices is the trick. And it’s not simple, says the writer.Hackett's arrival in a hitherto insular company is bound to break a few design and perception norms and his presence has shifted narrative from how to devise new set of features for drivers to how drivers feel when they drive, what are their complaints and bugbears. Do they need chargers? Is the navigation system too complicated? What digital ecosphere are they comfortable with? These questions speed up and clarify design processes.We quote, ""In China, for instance, Ford is putting customers into comically primitive prototypes—foam body, cardboard seats—and asking them to role-play driving scenarios, teasing out preferences they might not have thought to articulate. Captured on video, a driver’s backwards glance at his mother-in-law revealed that her comfort was more important to him than his own. Thenceforth, the back seat took on greater significance in the design process.At Hackett’s Ford, you don’t move to the “make” phase until you have a deep understanding of how people use their cars and, even more important, why.""Hackett says it best in the piece, ""If you look at business history, the winners are almost always those that get their user experience right.”He told the writer that though a part of him wants to spend all his time in the design studio and rejoice in the potential of things, when he walks out of there, he has  another kind of accountability, which is, he has  to and the company has to—deliver results. He says, ""We have shareholders. That’s a design problem unto itself. How do you weld the two together?”As the piece puts it beautifully, Hackett knows that he needs to be more like the Jobs who returned to the company as CEO in 1997. Future-focused, yes. But aware that the future is built with cash generated in the now.How much time will Hackett get? We don't know yet but change is clear and present in the absence of mahogany furniture in the 11th-floor conference room of the Ford headquarters. It is now, as the writer tells us, an open workspace full of engineers and data scientists, sleeves rolled up, sketching the future and Ford’s position in arguably the greatest race in business.We leave you with the best line of the piece, “It will take some time,” Hackett said. But he’d rather get the right answers slowly than the wrong ones quickly.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/podcast/podcast-digging-deeper-ford-now-has-a-furniture-guy-in-charge-of-its-smart-mobility-unit-3671421.html,Research,"Hackett, says Useem, is reflective of Ford’s bet that the winner won’t be the best chassis maker or software maker, but the company that nails the interaction between man and machine.As Bill Ford, the company’s executive chairman (and great-grandson of Henry), explained, “One of the things that drew me to Jim was his commitment to design thinking, which puts the human being at the center of the equation.After Jobs had left the company, Norman suggested to the then CEO John Scully in 1993, the need for “someone who took the overview of what it was like to use these machines.” He formed a UX office and styled himself as Apple’s user-experience architect, informs the piece.This affected design ideologies around the world.We quote, ""The migration of UX thinking to other industries was accelerated by the Palo Alto design outfit Ideo, whose founder, David Kelley, helped design the first Apple mouse.","['Useem', 'Ford', 'Apple', 'Apple']",['$5.4 trillion']

"Entrepreneurs reveal why travelling is important for business ideas, innovation",18 December,"Travelling, domestic or overseas, not only gives you a break from a monotonous schedule, but helps in shaping you as a person and more so as an entrepreneur.Today, a lot of emphasis is being given to travel, especially for business owners as it helps in building character, developing entrepreneurial characteristics, shaping problem-solving abilities and adding perspective to numerous aspects.Ideally, every entrepreneur should travel, explore and go beyond limits to challenge themselves. Here are three entrepreneurs who travelled across geographies that helped them achieve their desired goals.Bhavin Turakhia, Co-Founder and CEO, Zeta:The versatile Turakhia told Moneycontrol: ""From learning how to communicate in different ways to experiencing new cultures, the entire process of travelling has had profound effects on not just my professional life but also as a person.""Travelling across geographies for business has helped me network better, become agile and manage my time efficiently — the qualities that have now become an intrinsic part of me. While it's true that business travel comes with its own set of challenges, it offers me the space and time to clear my head, gain a new perspective and evaluate every single business opportunity with a fresh lens.""In addition to work, while travelling, I ensure I indulge in fitness activities such as hiking. Recently, I did the Fira-Oia hike in Santorini and the Mount Lycabettus walk in Athens, Greece. While they definitely helped me recharge, these activities furthered my qualities such as patience and perseverance, and opened me to explore new ideas and avenues.""He goes on to add, ""I believe life is what happens when you step outside of your comfort zone, and that’s where solid experiences are found. Make traveling a priority and find ways to apply skills you learn to future business ventures.""Vishal Gondal, Founder & CEO, GOQiiIn a candid conversation, Gondal said, ""Travel has shaped me and GOQii into what we are today. The knowledge and exposure a single travel gives, is more than 10 books combined. Interestingly, I met Luke Coutinho, who is one of our partners at GOQii, on a flight. He has played an instrumental role in building the GOQii business and introducing cancer management on our platform; which is a first-of-its-kind initiative in the country.""Business travels have given me the privilege of meeting numerous game-changers across the world and learn from their experiences, helping form long-term partnerships who ultimately accelerate business outcomes and enhance my entrepreneurial experience. Travel isn't always pretty and comfortable. Sometimes it’s full of uncertainties, delays, frustrations and disappointments. Travelling makes you resilient and ready to take on every adventure with a positive attitude. Wherever I have travelled, from Everest Base Camp, Tokyo, Cairo or Mexico, I have enjoyed every step. To sum it, through travel, I have seen myself grow, create, inspire, evolve, ideate, develop and achieve my goals.""Javed Tapia, Founder, SlonkitTapia had a different view, ""Entrepreneurs thrive on perspectives and experiences. People, cultures, and places enable them to draw inspiration for business growth. In today's digital world, collaboration and co-creation are key aspects of success.

Building a company: Why nine hours a day is not enough,14 April,"By Bhavin Turakhia, Founder and CEO, FlockFor organisations across the globe, boosting the efficiency of their employees and their work-life balance is a top priority. When workplace efficiency is hindered due to process inefficiencies, organisations lose out on time that could otherwise have been used to meet deadlines, pitch for new business, troubleshoot problems, and so on. When employees try to compensate for time lost by working overtime, it can affect their focus at work and upset their work-life balance.To keep employees motivated and productive, many organisations are seeking new ways to maximise the use of time spent at work. Apart from training employees in simple time management strategies such as how to minimise distractions, prioritise assignments, and conduct weekly reviews, companies are also identifying resources and tools that can aid workplace efficiency. Even so, workplace efficiency continues to suffer for a variety of reasons.Why nine hours are not enoughAccording to a survey conducted by personal financial management service, Think Money, a third of employees are distracted at work for up to three hours a day. This adds up to at least 60 hours of unproductive time a month or over 700 hours each year. The survey respondents cited a variety of reasons for their being distracted at work. This includes factors such as noise, slow PCs or bad internet connectivity, mobile phones, social media, personal messages, and uncomfortable workplace ambience.However, most employees cited the number of active work hours spent on meetings as the primary factor for decreased workplace efficiency. Meetings are inevitable as they help to facilitate collaboration between departments and teams within the organisation, and between customers and vendors outside the organisation. But sometimes, instead of being productivity tools, meetings often become productivity-antagonists, primarily due to the manner in which they are conducted. For instance, a simple decision that could be taken via a two-minute online discussion thread becomes the matter of an hour-long in-person meeting. This is really a waste of precious, productive time.Even virtual meetings come with their own share of drawbacks - mainly because ineffective technology platforms are used. Take, for example, a meeting scheduled by video conferencing. In most cases, the agenda is distributed to those attending prior to the actual meeting via email or a collaborative workspace. However, the meeting itself seldom integrates back into those environments, and when it does, it requires tedious manual work.Get smarter - hard work is passé Even though employees put in about 9+ hours at their organisations, they struggle to manage their deadlines and KRAs. So, is there a way for them to increase their efficiency within their scheduled work hours?The answer lies in adopting smarter collaboration tools. With teams on the move, organisations need to come out of their silos or fragmented work processes and use smart collaboration tools to create extra manhours. Creating more time within active manhours will not only increase workplace efficiency but also boost the organisation’s profitability.Many organisations have started adopting smart communication tools. Team messengers, in particular, are most effective as they offer features that not only help employees enhance their productivity, but also manage time effectively.Team messengers also make virtual meetings more effective by offering seamless video conferencing and the ability to share screenshots, rich note attachments, and even code snippets.The key to a more efficient tomorrowAccording to a 2014 report by Business Insider, an incredible USD 37 billion is lost each year to inefficient meetings. However, the ultimate goal of manufacturing the most amount of time out of active man-hours is not just getting costs under control. The goal is to create a more efficient collaboration platform that reduces the time spent on basic, repetitive tasks and increases the avenues for innovation and efficiency.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/startup/building-a-company-why-nine-hours-a-day-is-not-enough-2255041.html,Research,"Even so, workplace efficiency continues to suffer for a variety of reasons.Why nine hours are not enoughAccording to a survey conducted by personal financial management service, Think Money, a third of employees are distracted at work for up to three hours a day.Team messengers, in particular, are most effective as they offer features that not only help employees enhance their productivity, but also manage time effectively.Team messengers also make virtual meetings more effective by offering seamless video conferencing and the ability to share screenshots, rich note attachments, and even code snippets.The key to a more efficient tomorrowAccording to a 2014 report by Business Insider, an incredible USD 37 billion is lost each year to inefficient meetings.","['Think Money', 'Business Insider']",['USD 37 billion']

Budget 2017: Weighted deductions for incurring pharma R&D should continue,24 January,"Hitesh SharmaThe demonetisation scheme announced by the government in November 2016 and its effects on the economy over the last couple of months has made the Union Budget 2017 an eagerly awaited event. Many believe that with the US and many nations in Europe undergoing a transition in power and thereby, in policy, this Budget could play a critical role in pushing India’s standing as a global innovative economy. The pharmaceutical sector has been one of the key sectors in the shaping up of the Indian economy and it will continue playing a major role in its development. The Government has realised its importance and has introduced a number of policy initiatives in the past in order to boost the sector. India is the largest provider of generic drugs and the growth of the Indian pharmaceutical industry is expected be nearly 3 times the growth of the global pharma industry. One of the major reasons for this high growth is the low labour cost, with the cost of labour in the country nearly half of that in the US or Europe. Some of the general tax expectations of corporate India relate to providing a definite roadmap for reduction of the corporate tax rate and elimination of MAT. This article lists down some of the key tax expectations of the pharma industry from Budget 2017. Boost to innovation and simplification of the law and reduction in litigation are the key themes emerging from these expectations. Boost to innovationInnovation is one of the most critical aspects necessary for the pharma industry to survive and thrive. In order to enable innovation, it is important to encourage corporate spending on research and development. While the patent box regime has been introduced to encourage innovation, it may not necessarily encourage corporate spending on the R&D as the provisions of the patent box regime would apply only in case of successful registration of patents and would not apply in cases where the research has not been successful or fruitful. Therefore, in order to encourage spending on R&D, it is imperative that the weighted deductions provided for incurring R&D expenditure continue and not be phased out. In respect of the patent box regime, the beneficial regime needs to be fine-tuned in order to ensure that it achieves its objective of fuelling innovation. Currently, the patent box regime applies only to royalty income and would not apply to a taxpayer who uses the patent for in-house manufacturing. In order to ensure that all the taxpayers who have registered their patents get the benefit of the regime, the regime should be extended to taxpayers who sell their products using the products developed by them in-house and registered by providing a certain pre-determined portion of the income from sale of goods exempt from tax. Further, the beneficial regime, currently applied only for income by way of royalty, should also be extended to income from transfer of patents developed and registered in India. Currently, R&D/clinical trial services performed in India are liable to service tax at the rate of 15% even when the recipient of service is situated outside India. In order to lower the cost of provision of such services and to boost innovation in the country and make such services globally competitive, it is important to provide for some sort of exemption from indirect tax on such services.Simplification and reduction of litigationThe industry has seen increased litigation in respect of deductibility of expenses incurred by pharma companies for sponsorship of various events involving doctors. The tax department is referring to the MCI Guidelines, which prohibits doctors from accepting freebies, while disallowing such expenses as not permitted under law in the hands of the pharma companies. While there are contrary judicial precedents in this regard, there is a need to provide certain clarity as to whether the MCI Guidelines apply to pharma companies in light of the impending mandatory code to replace the optional UCPMP in order to cut down on unnecessary litigation.Other expectationsToday, one of key issues facing the pharma industry has been the overdependence on China for import of active pharmaceutical ingredients (‘API’), which are used as raw materials for the manufacture of pharmaceutical products. Therefore the need of the hour is to boost manufacture of APIs in the country by providing incentives in the form of tax incentives, subsidies, etc., which one hopes is announced in the upcoming Budget.Moreover, in order to attract foreign investment and achieve the objective of making India one of the top 3 players in the pharma sector by 2020 and an innovation hub, it is important that the FDI limit in brownfield projects should be increased to 100% under the automatic route.Further, while the roll-out of GST has been postponed to July 2017, one hopes that adequate time is provided for its implementation in order to address operational issues such as loan licensee related job work transaction, treatment of expired goods, transitional provisions related challenges etc.Lastly on the policy front, while one would need to wait to measure the success of the Jan Aushadi Scheme, one hopes that the government implements the setting up of the pharma parks announced earlier and announces certain R&D policy incentives in order to provide a boost to the industry.

"Long term, gold use looks good despite note ban: WGC",24 January,"Gold demand in India -- the world's largest consumer -- has been affected in the short term because of the shock demonetisation, but long-term prospects are encouraging with consumption to average at 850-950 per annum by 2020, the World Gold Council (WGC) said today.While the main demand will be for jewellery, bar and coin investment is expected to be 250-300 tonnes by 2020. Jewellery exports are estimated to touch the USD 40 billion mark, from the current USD 8.6 billion.Stating that transparency across the value chain is necessary for gold to be mainstream, WGC said gold trade will become more transparent with introduction of GST, mandatory hallmarking and a massive push by organised jewellers to promote non-cash payments.However, the latest cash ban exercise should also expand the tax base and the positive impact on public finances could generate a more benign and gold-supportive policy approach, it suggested.There has been short-term impact on gold demand in the country due to demonetisation as there were fears that the government may cap gold holdings and gold buying. Buyers stayed away for a brief while, said Somasundaram P R, head of WGC's India operations, after unveiling the report titled India's Gold Market -- evolution and innovation.Since it is difficult to say right now how much of an impact the demonetisation move had on gold demand, WGC is still analysing it and will come out with a detailed report soon, he said.""As of now, we still maintain that overall gold demand will average at 650-750 tonnes in 2016. Definitely, demand will be at a lower range,"" he said.India's gold demand stood at 441.2 tonnes in January-September of 2016. Demand during Diwali and for weddings held up well until November 8 when the government announced ban on Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes, according to the WGC.Gold smuggling is expected to be higher in 2016 because of 1 per cent manufacturing excise tax. About 119 tonnes are estimated to have been imported through unofficial channels in 2015, it said.Observing that cash crunch is taking a toll on gold demand in the short term, WGC in the report said even genuine gold buyers are reluctant to buy wedding jewellery as there is panic after taxmen investigated some jewellers who had, immediately after demonetization, created opportunities to convert old currency for fake or back-dated sales.The caps on withdrawals from banks and lack of cash in ATMs meant that whatever cash available was largely spent on essential items -- in both rural and urban India -- it added.Small jewellery businesses, particularly in rural centres, will feel the pinch until cash becomes more freely available, the council said further.Stating that India's economy is going to be strong and will support the gold market, WGC Market Intelligence Director Alistair Hewitt said, ""In 2016, India was one of the world's fastest growing economies. While the economy was rocked by the shock demonetisation programme, it will bounce back and that will support the gold market in years to come.""

I am working with London's business community to ensure their needs are met as we leave the EU and that our great city maintains its global position,"" London mayor Sadiq Khan said.New York experienced no significant change in its ratings, retaining its No. 2 slot, also for the fifth year running.Paris dropped out of the top three to fourth position, due largely to a perceived decrease in the levels of cultural interaction and research and development. The terrorist attacks of November 2015 are also likely to have influenced those ratings.Tokyo overtook Paris and moved into third place. The increase was due to a number of factors, including a reduction in Japan's rate of corporate taxation, an increase in the number of visitors to the city from abroad and an increase in the number of direct flight connections to overseas destinations.Singapore completes the top 5 cities in the annual ranking.The Japan-based Mori Memorial Foundation's Institute for Urban Strategies has published its GPCI report annually since 2008.

"Govt to fast-track patent proposals, opens Tatkal window",17 May,"In order to streamline the patent regime, the government has modified rules by offering an option of 'Tatkal' for expeditious clearance of applications by start-ups or those entities that opt for India as a place for first filing of patent.The government also plans to significantly cut down the time period for grant of patents to two and a half years immediately and one and a half years by March 2018, from the existing 5-7 years.As per the modified patent rules, entities can choose the fast clearance route for obtaining patent by paying additional fees if they select India as International Search Authority or International Preliminary Examining Authorities and file their applications in India first.""The move is aimed at popularising India as a patent filing hub so that more companies file applications in India,"" said Rajiv Aggarwal, Joint Secretary, DIPP. He said benefits of modified rules will be available only to new applicants.Also start-ups which meet the prescribed criteria can use the Tatkal route for getting faster clearance of their patent applications.The fees for start-ups will be same as individuals and not as companies, Aggarwal clarified.Under the faster clearance route, application fees for individuals and start-ups have been kept at Rs 8,000 while for companies, it could be as much as Rs 60,000.Under normal circumstances, initial patent filing cost ranges between Rs 1,600 and Rs 8,800.To clear the backlog of patent applications, the revised rules provide for refund of fees in the case of withdrawal of an application.

Last week, government announced a comprehensive national IPR policy, which calls for updating intellectual property laws, including Indian Cinematography Act to remove anomalies and inconsistencies in consultation with stakeholders. It also aims to curb the manufacturing and sale of counterfeits.Indian courts have kept up the rule of law and protection of patents and rights of patent holders have never been undermined, Sitharaman told reporters in New Delhi.""But now with this policy, we have given a direction to it, to the whole idea of how we are going to sustain and build on the interest for innovation, how R&D is going to strengthen India's patent related matters and how as a government we are going to help them strengthening awareness,"" she added.The Minister further said, ""Also, most importantly in India, conversion of copyright of patents for commercial use has never been a vibrant space."" Very few people even bother to register a patent or apply for a copyright and those who did thought that converting it for commercial use was not their cup of tea, she said.""That dichotomy had undermined the potential that existed. This policy, the way in which we have drawn the action plan for startups and trying to link it all up to creativity and to the larger public, that's where I think the policy has come very well.""Make it possible for every patent that has the potential for commercial use, make it possible for every copyright that has the potential for commercial use,"" Sitharaman noted.Sitharaman said another area where the policy has focused is a ""systemic or systematic way"" for filing of patents.""There will be a layer of people who can explain how this can be done (patents and copyrights).

"BHIVE Workspace Secures Angel Funding from Key Investors and Announces its 4th Location, in a Short Span of a Year!",08 February,"Business Wire IndiaAiming at optimum functioning and boosted productivity, BHIVE is a creative workspace solution for all work enthusiasts; entrepreneurs, start-ups and businesses.Shesh Paplikar, CEO & Founder of BHIVE Workspace, firmly believes that co-working spaces are essential to developing a growing and vibrant entrepreneurial ecosystem in India. He reflects that while an entrepreneur or startup spends time, efforts and investments on taking an idea to the next level, there exists many trivial, yet significant, issues that grab attention. Finding the right workspace, maintenance of office space, bill payments and operations, house-keeping and security, procuring food and beverages etc. are a few such distractions. Setting up the perfect backdrop to fix this issue or to amplify one’s productivity, lead to the conception of BHIVE Workspace.BHIVE started out as a provider of accessible and quality plug ‘n’ play workspace in Koramangla, Bangalore. Today, one year from conception, it fulfills the vision behind its existence by fueling efficiency, catalyzing innovation, triggering collaborations and housing success stories of about 90 startups covering 400 active members. BHIVE Workspace is opening its fourth location (HSR Sector 4) shortly!“TaxiForSure overgrew its 1200 sq. ft. office space in no time. The growing needs of the company took its employees to four different offices in the same year. Many efforts, that rather be invested on work, were channeled into becoming a fully functional office space. When I heard that my classmate Shesh was contemplating around the same issue, taking away this burden from a dedicated mind, I knew the model would work,” says investor Mr. Raghunandan G, Co-Founder & CEO, TaxiForSure.The success of this co-working space has attracted angel investments, from the likes of Raghunandan G (Founder, TaxiForSure), Rajesh Rai (Venture Capitalist & Co-Founder, Venturesity), Arihant Patni (Managing Director, Hive Technologies), Sanjay Mirchandani (Owner, Mirchandani Group), Arun Narayan (Director, UK India Business Council) and others making it the largest in India’s startup capital Bangalore. BHIVE Workspace houses startups, small businesses and companies. RoadRunnr, which is now a commended startup, started out of a 6 seater cabin in BHIVE Koramangala. Arpit Dave, Co-founder RoadRunnr says, “BHIVE helped us focus and accelerate in our early stage by providing us with the right scaffolds; requirements met, space, processes etc. We enjoyed our time as BHIVE members and moved out as we grew very large.”Placed in prime locations in Bangalore, BHIVE houses enthusiasts across various work profiles like - Tech, Software, Mobile, Hardware, IOT, Fintech, Education, Innovation, Foodtech, Gaming, eCommerce, B2B, B2C, Hyperlocal, Social Impact & freelancers. The coming together of amazingly different yet like-minded and industrious individuals, in such a vibrant workspace, to meet, collaborate, communicate and exchange ideas, often creates value that nourishes the whole community. Mr. Arihant Patni, investor, says, “Entrepreneurs need all the help they can get to achieve their vision. Physical work space is one thing, but having support from a community of mentors and other entrepreneurs in the same space is a big asset. BHIVE aims to provide this ecosystem in a way that will really help startups get to the next level. I am excited to support them in this journey.”Be it testing a product or hiring the right employee, finding the co-founder or investors… it all happens at BHIVE. The community celebrates one another’s successes. Mr. Vardhan Koshal, Udacity, explains “We being a small team derive energy from the larger community around us. Working alongside hundred odd people in such a workspace fills us with a feeling of expanse, which in turn keeps us motivated; on a busy day, a good conversation with a fellow member works as a stress buster. This apart, BHIVE Workspace comes at very affordable prices and includes various member benefits and discounts, making the experience more enjoyable!” BHIVE forms a bridge to support its members for today’s fast moving, energetic and competitive global startup environment. In the regard, BHIVE Workspace has attracted partners like the Open Coffee Club. Mr. Amarinder Singh, Co-nurturer of Open Coffee Club (OCC), says, “OCC Bangalore is one of the oldest entrepreneurship un-conference styled communities in India. BHIVE is Bangalore’s largest co-working space. As the two are aligned in principal, it is but natural that there’s a marriage between them. We value and encourage such a partnership that, together, bridges the gap for many startups in the ecosystem.”Ravi, Co-founder BHIVE Workspace, explains that BHIVE is set to be both inspiring and encouraging, for work and other aspects of a member’s life. Mr. Vidhya Shankar, Head- Partner Alliances, NASSCOM 10,000 startups says, “Our program is fully committed in ensuring the success of the start-up ecosystem in the country, which is fast doubling in the number of VCs, investors and incubators and accelerators of tech start-ups as per our recent start-ups landscape survey. As the start-up capital of India, Bangalore is witnessing its fair share of growth. We are glad to extend our support to BHIVE in building a unique co-working space that supports the fast expanding eco-system in the city catering to the needs of the developer community and in nurturing talented start-ups.” Some member focussed benefits are: Access to a growing and well-networked startup communityConnects with investors from across the globeFree events, mentoring sessions, panel discussions and workshops across varied areas like funding, women entrepreneurship, investments, legal etc.Internal and informal events to trigger interaction within BHIVE, and parties in prominent hangout zones to help initiate collaboration within the start-up community, mentors and investors in Bangalore.Dedicated games area to leave members refreshed after their breaksStrong fitness focus to reflect as a good work-life balance in member livesSpecial discounts & services from BHIVE partners across different sectors benefiting the communityThe community app & mailing list to stay regularly updated about the recent successes and needs of the community, which in turn helps many internal companies to get new in-house business & references. Adithya Kathpalia, Chief Evangelist with Excubator, says, “Events at BHIVE not just brings knowledge and learning experiences from experts, but also becomes a platform for networking and collaborations.

Design innovation at the core of B‘lore startup‘s success,28 January,"India's largest tea retail chain, Chai Point, was path-breaking in launching its Chai delivery service - Chai-on-Call. Chai-on-Call is arguably India's largest hot beverage delivery service. The core innovation in this delivery service was the heat-retaining disposable flask that retains heat for 45-60 minutes.Chai Point was the first company in India to develop and launch this unique heat retaining use & throw flask. The team at Chai Point saw the necessity to invent this flask based on customer demand for tea delivery at their offices and the scalability and hygiene that is missing in traditional thermos based chai deliveries. As Chai Point's service hubs spread across Bangalore, it found customers coming over with ceramic/glass flasks and taking back Chai in them. The contentious issue for Chai Point team was to ensure that the flask was clean so that Chai quality would never be doubted. This led to the development of this unique format.""It took us about nine months to get the pouch specifications and the design right. We have always been particular about quality - it's our foremost operating pillar. We made sure that all the five layers of the pouch were approved for food industry usage and that the inner most layer was certified to be BPA free,"" said Yaduvir Singh, Head of Supply Chain at Chai Point.To the surprise of Chai Point's operations team, chai deliveries to offices outgrew the take-away format. Its initial flask capacity was 1.0 litre and within six months of its launch, it also launched a 500 ml capacity flask called the 'Mini'.""We knew that delivery of Chai was already a hugely prevalent practice in India. This flask could completely give a new-age flip to this already huge though fragmented business. We could visualize that Chai-on-Call was going to be our fastest growing business. And luckily, we were spot on,"" said Amuleek Singh Bijral, CEO of Chai Point.Chai Point will also be launching a 350 ml heat-retaining flask unit and intends to call it the 'Uni'. The driver behind the 'Uni' is to give individual customers the incentive to order Chai in this flask format. 'Uni' is likely to accompany food as a combo unit only. ""We also realize that unlike other F&B delivery items, ours come with a lot less fatigue. Chai is ordered by our customers more as a part of their daily habit routine rather than as an indulgence. We have, in fact, more than 250 customers that now subscribe to our Chai flask. This count is increasing at more than 25% rate month-on-month,"" said Yangchen Lachungpa, Head of Deliveries and Channels at Chai Point.This flask innovation brought Chai Point's core product offering - Chai - into the realm of technology-driven delivery. Now about 75% of its orders for Chai come through online channels and Chai Point's mobile app.Their goal now is markedly to enhance its delivery reliability and build a strong level of trust within its customer base around timeliness alongside its core strength of quality.Chai Point already prides itself on its cloud-based propriety software platform internally dubbed as 'Shark'. Chai-on-Call necessitated the crucial additions of delivery management and campaign management functionalities within 'Shark'. All this, was again by Chai Point's internal technology team.Chai Point had recently announced that it has built a fleet of 60 electric bikes to fuel this business. It also recently launched an internal app for its delivery fleet to better manage the timeliness of its deliveries. Chai Point also has partnerships with leading food delivery companies like Swiggy and stand-alone delivery startups like Shadowfax and Roadrunner.""We delivered about 3 lakh Chai flask units in the last calendar year. This year we fully appreciate that the 10-15 lakh number is well within our grasp,"" said Sandesh C, COO of Chai Point.In addition, Chai Point is working on measures with a waste and recycling management vendor, to help recycle the eco-friendly flasks - thus, consciously aligning themselves to being environmentally responsible.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/startup/design-innovation-atcorebâ€™lore-startupâ€™s-success--1046741.html,Research,"The team at Chai Point saw the necessity to invent this flask based on customer demand for tea delivery at their offices and the scalability and hygiene that is missing in traditional thermos based chai deliveries.We made sure that all the five layers of the pouch were approved for food industry usage and that the inner most layer was certified to be BPA free,"" said Yaduvir Singh, Head of Supply Chain at Chai Point.To the surprise of Chai Point's operations team, chai deliveries to offices outgrew the take-away format.","[""Chai Point's""]",[]
"Govt to bear patent cost, relax procurement norms for startups",18 January,"To encourage young entrepreneurs and innovation, government has decided to bear the entire cost of facilitation for filing of patents, trademarks or designs as well as relaxed public procurement norms for start-ups. As per the action plan announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi yesterday, the start-ups would only have to pay the statutory fees. ""The central government shall bear the entire fees of the facilitators for any number of patents, trademarks or designs that a startup may file, and the start-ups shall bear the cost of only the statutory fees payable,"" the action plan said.The move is aimed at promoting awareness and adoption of intellectual property rights (IPRs) by start-ups and facilitate them in protecting and commercialising those rights. Experts said that the incentives given by the government for IPR related things would help the start-ups in filing more number of patents, trademarks and designs. ""This will be an incentive for start-ups to engage in innovation and also for protection of their intellectual property rights,"" National Intellectual Property Organisation (NIPO) President T C James said.The action plan says that a panel of facilitators would be empaneled by the Controller General of Patents Designs and Trademark. Facilitators will be responsible for providing general advisory on different IPRs as also information on protecting and promoting IPRs in other countries. They would provide assistance in filing and disposal of the IP applications related to patents, trademarks and designs including appearing on behalf of startup hearings and contesting opposition, if any, by other parties, till final disposal of the IPR application.The government has also decided to provide an 80 percent rebate in filing of patents vis-a-vis other companies. This will help them pare costs in the crucial formative years. ""The scheme is being launched initially on a pilot basis for one year; based on the experience gained, further steps shall be taken,"" it said.The government has also decided to relax norms for public procurement for start-ups. In order to promote start-ups, government would exempt them in the manufacturing sector from the criteria of ""prior experience/turnover"" without any relaxation in quality standards or technical parameters. Further, the government announced a credit guarantee fund for ensuring risk cover in case of default of debt provided by venture capital funds.As per the action plan, Rs 2,000 crore credit guarantee fund would be available for startups. The government also announced steps to reduce the regulatory burden on startups thereby allowing them to focus on their core business and keep compliance cost low. ""In case of environment laws, startups which fall under the 'white category' (as defined by the Central Pollution Control Board) would be able to self-certify compliance and only random checks would be carried out in such cases,"" it said.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/economy/govt-to-bear-patent-cost-relax-procurement-norms-for-startups-1049762.html,Research,"""The central government shall bear the entire fees of the facilitators for any number of patents, trademarks or designs that a startup may file, and the start-ups shall bear the cost of only the statutory fees payable,"" the action plan said.The move is aimed at promoting awareness and adoption of intellectual property rights (IPRs) by start-ups and facilitate them in protecting and commercialising those rights.They would provide assistance in filing and disposal of the IP applications related to patents, trademarks and designs including appearing on behalf of startup hearings and contesting opposition, if any, by other parties, till final disposal of the IPR application.The government has also decided to provide an 80 percent rebate in filing of patents vis-a-vis other companies.","['IP', 'IPR']",[]

And they expect the proportion of their revenues generated by collaboration with entrepreneurs to rise from an average of 9 percent today to 20 percent in five years.Large companies and entrepreneurs agree that today corporate venturing and incubator models of collaboration will increasingly give way to more open and joint innovation, whereby corporates don't just fund startups, but use digital collaboration to jointly create innovations in broader networks of partners. However, corporates and entrepreneurs don't see eye to eye on how to achieve that.While 78 percent of large companies say that working with entrepreneurs is important or critical to their own growth and innovation, only 67 percent of entrepreneurs hold that view. And while 41 percent of corporates believe small companies are committed to supporting their growth as they work together, only one quarter (24 percent) of entrepreneurs think large companies are likewise committed to supporting the growth of their smaller partners. Further, entrepreneurs and startups are four times more likely than corporates to say their counterparts lack commitment to working together (29 percent versus 7 percent).Cultural differences compound the divisions. The report found that, while 75 percent of large companies judge themselves as sufficiently entrepreneurial, 75 percent of those entrepreneurs who previously worked at large companies left because they did not feel they could be entrepreneurial there.""In the digital economy, corporations have the opportunity to disrupt their markets by working more effectively with innovative startups to jointly create new products and services, said Paul Daugherty, Chief Technology Officer, Accenture. ""That means corporates should not just fund startup innovation, but actively participate in it by pooling ideas, assets and intellectual property. And it will require them to take new approaches to sharing risks and rewards more equitably.Digital collaboration boosts growthThe report also reveals that greater digital collaboration between G20 large companies and entrepreneurs could result in an additional $1.5 trillion in global economic output, according to Accenture Digital Collaboration Index and economic model, equivalent to a 2.2 percent uplift to global GDP. The Index uses the survey data and economic modelling to predict the potential dividend of greater digital collaboration. It shows that the top fifth of those committed to collaboration achieved higher levels of revenue growth and that, if all entrepreneurs and large companies were to achieve the degree of collaboration of the top 20 percent, revenue growth rates could rise between 3 and 18 percentage points for entrepreneurs, and between 2 and 16 percentage points for large companies.""The journey to open innovation requires large companies to recognize that collaboration cannot continue to be done on their terms, on their premises or just for their benefit, said Jitendra Kavathekar, managing director, Open Innovation, Accenture. ""To make a success of digital disruption will require new forms of innovation in which multiple partners collaborate to create, fail and try again in more experimental and entrepreneurial settings. That can only happen if more participants come together through digitally enabled networks to create innovations together.Harnessing the Power of Entrepreneurs to Open Innovation, makes a series of recommendations. Large companies are encouraged to:Set a clear strategy that defines shared outcomes to give all parties confidence that their ROI and commitments will be shared equally.Define and budget for success: Ensure that successful ideas are not stranded beyond pilot phase and can be scaled quickly.Seed an intrapreneurship culture by seconding employees to start-ups and encouraging employees to launch their own start-ups.The report also makes recommendations for governments to consider:Develop co-financing models: Encourage a greater range of financing models, from public grants to crowdfunding, to meet the varying need of entrepreneurs at different stages.Create collaboration networks: Actively build clusters and networks by supporting and funding groups of partners rather than single universities or participants.Encourage a borderless physical world: Support digital trade through regulation that encourages the safe exchange of data across borders and immigration policies that secure the supply of critical talent.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/trends/features/bigsmall-businesses-failing-to-use-digital-collaboration-1325079.html,Research,"And they expect the proportion of their revenues generated by collaboration with entrepreneurs to rise from an average of 9 percent today to 20 percent in five years.Large companies and entrepreneurs agree that today corporate venturing and incubator models of collaboration will increasingly give way to more open and joint innovation, whereby corporates don't just fund startups, but use digital collaboration to jointly create innovations in broader networks of partners.Large companies are encouraged to:Set a clear strategy that defines shared outcomes to give all parties confidence that their ROI and commitments will be shared equally.Define and budget for success: Ensure that successful ideas are not stranded beyond pilot phase and can be scaled quickly.Seed an intrapreneurship culture by seconding employees to start-ups and encouraging employees to launch their own start-ups.The report also makes recommendations for governments to consider:Develop co-financing models: Encourage a greater range of financing models, from public grants to crowdfunding, to meet the varying need of entrepreneurs at different stages.Create collaboration networks: Actively build clusters and networks by supporting and funding groups of partners rather than single universities or participants.Encourage a borderless physical world: Support digital trade through regulation that encourages the safe exchange of data across borders and immigration policies that secure the supply of critical talent.",[],"['$1.5 trillion', '$52 billion', 'an additional $1.5 trillion']"

"Keiretsu Forum Partners with IIMB/NSRCEL to Support Innovation, Entrepreneurship",10 September,"Business Wire IndiaThe U.S-based angel investor network Keiretsu Forum, that has 39 chapters around the world and more than 1500 investors and members, signed an exclusive partnership with the NS Raghavan Centre for Entrepreneurial Learning (NSRCEL) at the Indian Institute of Management Bangalore (IIMB). The association will help facilitate innovation and entrepreneurship with an emphasis on educating entrepreneurs, investors and venture funding ecosystem participants on business formation, new technology platforms and global best practices. “NSRCEL at IIMB has been constantly striving to create a network that its mentees and incubatees can benefit from. Angel investors have an important part to play in facilitating the growth of entrepreneurship. A global forum like Keiretsu can make a huge positive difference to the funding phenomenon. IIMB and NSRCEL are happy to partner with Keiretsu to launch a joint endeavor to augment the availability of early stage funding. IIMB is also pleased with the opportunity to partner with Keiretsu for the potential academic benefits it hopes to realize such as a closer understanding of the phenomenon of early stage funding of enterprises and opportunities for its students to intern with Keiretsu forum in its investment activities. All of these anticipated outcomes are in line with the overall intensified emphasis on and encouragement to entrepreneurship at IIM under the leadership of Dr. Sushil Vachani, Director,” said Dr G Sabarinathan, Chairperson, NSRCEL. “We want to bring angel funding within the reach of every start-up with a commercially viable business model,” said Randy Williams, Founder and CEO of Keiretsu Forum who is in town to launch the Bangalore Chapter. Keiretsu Forum Bangalore will be formally launched on Friday. “We want to ensure that investors who are looking for opportunities are provided a steady flow of quality deals and the opportunity to meaningfully engage with their investee companies,” he said. “There are people here trying to address uniquely Indian problems and opportunities from agriculture and rural needs to cutting-edge innovations in space travel. These ideas and innovations must be nurtured and these entrepreneurs mentored to ensure they achieve full potential. That takes more than money. It takes committed, serious investors who are willing to be patient, and capable of leveraging their networks to help,” Mr. Williams added. Founded in 2000 in the U.S, Keiretsu Forum is a global investor network that brings together angel investors and the entrepreneur community. It works with similar networks, leading academic institutions and other stakeholders to develop and grow the entrepreneur ecosystem in host countries. Unlike the bigger venture capital funds and corporate investors, Keiretsu Forum members focus on very early stage investments in companies which they personally mentor and grow before taking to bigger investors or the IPO market. While on the one hand, Indian start-ups looking for early stage funding will appear on the radar of international investors through Keiretsu Forum’s global chapter network, on the other, Indian investors looking for early- stage opportunities will get access to global deals through the same network. “There will be global deal flow as well as value creation,” said Denny Kurien, President & CEO of Keiretsu Forum Bangalore, who was present at IIM Bangalore on Thursday. “In today’s world, every technology and product is international. The resources required to create a winning company can’t be supplied by one or two people. The resources – money, people, partnerships, channels, access to customers etc. are diverse and distributed,” said Robin Bisarya, Co-President of Keiretsu Forum Bangalore. Bisarya, who will be based in San Diego, U.S, as the Bangalore chapter’s main link between investor and entrepreneur communities in the two countries, said unless the start-up is located in a well-known hub where the community is used to supplying these resources in a manner that can be consumed and afforded by early-stage companies, start-ups have to pay for these services. “The start-ups most likely to succeed are those that address this need from the very beginning and prepare their corporate structure, intellectual structure and personal policies accordingly, and we will help them do that,” Bisarya added.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/wire-news/keiretsu-forum-partnersiimbnsrcel-to-support-innovation-entrepreneurship-1440893.html,Research,"IIMB is also pleased with the opportunity to partner with Keiretsu for the potential academic benefits it hopes to realize such as a closer understanding of the phenomenon of early stage funding of enterprises and opportunities for its students to intern with Keiretsu forum in its investment activities.Bisarya, who will be based in San Diego, U.S, as the Bangalore chapter’s main link between investor and entrepreneur communities in the two countries, said unless the start-up is located in a well-known hub where the community is used to supplying these resources in a manner that can be consumed and afforded by early-stage companies, start-ups have to pay for these services.","['IIMB', 'Keiretsu', 'Keiretsu']",[]

Customized solutions for mass market,05 January,"Recently when I saw a Japanese film, “A stitch of Life”, directed by Yukiko Mishima, I was reminded of a vain Gandhian dream of forging close connections between producer and consumer through customized products and services.  A Seamstress, Ichie persists with her vision of tailoring western design cloths using an old sewing machine for her customers.  Despite various proposals, suggestions and persuasive appeal, she doesn’t want to shift towards mass market through branding.  There are obviously customers who admire her tenacity and commitment to quality.  She learnt from her grandmother that a well-designed cloth actually influences one’s thinking.  When there isn’t even one stitch either more or less than needed, the crafted cloth becomes a meditative prayer.  Her attention to detail has convinced her that tailoring of clothes may even be tailoring of ties.   It is not just a cloth a tailor stitches, a tie is formed and a customer may come back to get clothes mended.  When another tailor known for refitting/altering the clothes wants to shut his shop because of increasing craze for readymade clothes, she tries to persuade him to persist too.Even large companies are trying to offer customization possibilities to consumers.  It is not inconceivable that in future only a few standard components will be designed for mass consumption, much of the customized adaptation will be done by the street corner shops/mechnics/artisans.  When big marketing malls were being planned, many small shop keepers were worried that they might have to close their shops.  If anything, number of small shops has increased whereas many big malls have closed down.  People don’t buy just things, they engage in a conversation.  If communication is the key, which can compose something that touches our heart better than the one who knows us more intimately.  May be, the intimacy will be the currency of future.Are we moving towards distributed manufacturing and consumption through tools like 3D printing?  Or is it a wishful thinking?  There is no doubt that artisanal attention to detail can never be substituted by mass produced goods and services.  May be, there is a case for slower but more intimate production through street corner bakeries, tailoring shops, shoe designers and other service and product providers.  Elaben talks about meeting one’s requirement from within 100 kms., which in the age of electronic goods from around the world may seem a bit difficult.  But the point is whether our desire to be ourselves will manifest in much bigger market for customized products and services.  If so, then skill development policies and programmes need to be redesigned.  A skill India will not serve an indistinguishable Indian or foreigner.  Home made bread, pickles, vegetables, embroidered clothes, cushions, car seats, etc., can give us a personality that does not seek approval from the peers or masses for standing out.  May be our creativity and originality will flourish more in customized market.  May be we will find Gandhi more relevant for creating differentiated skills for distinguished customers.  We all know that our shoes don’t always fit well.  If large number of leather workers use modern technology to make shoes according to our dimensions, many more of us will be happier and many more skilled workers will become entrepreneurs. A society having large number of small entrepreneurs is much more democratic than the one dominated by a few large businesses.  Unless we create a bridge between the large and the small sector, the intimate, affectionate and reassuring spaces will not survive, much less grow in our society.  It is our choice whether we want to be reckoned with as we are.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/startup/customized-solutions-for-mass-market-1052554.html,Research,"It is not just a cloth a tailor stitches, a tie is formed and a customer may come back to get clothes mended.It is not inconceivable that in future only a few standard components will be designed for mass consumption, much of the customized adaptation will be done by the street corner shops/mechnics/artisans.",[],[]

â€˜Govt taking efforts to strengthen SME financing‘,26 March,"With the strong focus on promoting the MSME sector and supporting their functioning by timely capital infusion, easy access to credit, providing necessary advisory assistance and technology infrastructure, the MSME’s are slated for an unprecedented growth in the years to come.SMEs are the engine of India's economy. They are a central part of the economic development model in the emerging economies like India, and they play a significant part in fuelling growth, innovation and prosperity. Despite all the positive development happening in this sector, there is still a huge demand supply gap and the sector is plagued by numerous challenges, such as:Availability of timely and affordable creditInadequate capital infusion and delayed payments from large corporates and PSU’s leading to working capital gapsRestricted access to organized finance.Traditionally banks have been the largest source of funds for the SMEs. Banks in India have had a conservative ecosystem, being risk averse and credit has primarily been extended against collateral.Also, the need gaps between organized lending sector and SME’s had resulted in SME’s reaching out to the high interest rate unorganized sector, leading to sustainability issues and high rate of chronic sickness. Realizing that the risk averse lending practices were hampering the growth, RBI and policy makers have taken significant efforts to strengthen SME financing. A plethora of options in terms of lending partners and customized debt solutions have been made available to the SME’s. These available options currently cater to the financing need of a very small segment of the total universe and there is still a huge demand supply gap which needs to be plugged through innovative financing options and timely capital infusion.The current lender-borrower relationship is plagued by issues such as:Collateral Issue - Unavailability of desired/acceptable collaterals or unwillingness to mortgage family owned assets.Interest cost – High cost of raising funds.Management of funds - Mismanagement of short term and long term assets resulting in doubtful sustainability.Unavailability of Credit Rating.Lack of technical expertise in information sharing and proposal development leading to failure in generation of required interest and confidence amongst lenders.Asymmetry in available financial information on Business.The landscape of the Indian SME sector has changed over the period of years. Government and the policy makers have realized the role SMEs play in the economic and social development, while a lot of innovation has happened in the area of SME lending we still feel a lot more that can be done.To meet the demand and leverage our footprint in the industry, we at RFL have adopted a cluster based lending within the identified geographies and building distribution capabilities to create a Direct to Customer model. We have also developed a unique mix of product offerings that aim to solve various financing needs both for long term and short term requirements. We offer both 'Secured' and 'Unsecured' loans’, for the self-employed, who are in business for more than 3 to 4 years with a proven business model and who aspire to raise capital for expansion. Thus we want to be the ‘Growth Capital’ providers to SME’s in India in the form of debt.And finally my advice to SMEs towards getting best funding will all depend on the type of funding the SMEs are looking if they are looking for a debt options then there are number of debt options available based on the stage of business.Number of Govt. formulated schemes like Collateral free loan up to INR 1 cr.Funding for working capital gaps are available via various credit lines like bill discounting, traditional bank overdraft, securitization of receivables, working capital term loan, factoring finance and short term trade finance.For export business owners, there are pre-shipment and post-shipment credits available to take care of the foreign exchange exposure against receivables.For capital expenditure (capex) and long term expansions, banks and NBFCs offers collateral based term loans (Loan against Property) and operating/financial lease options.If they are looking at equity based funding then -            Angel and Venture Capital-              Private Equity (PE) funds for higher ticket size requirements-              Access to funds through SME Exchanges.The emerging economic scenario in the country has thrown open vast opportunities for development and diversification of the MSME Sector. The present Government’s initiative of “Make in India”, and its emphasis upon increasing the share of the Manufacturing Sector in the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) from the present 14-15% to 25% by 2022, have the potential of transforming the fortunes of the Sector enabling it to scale unheard heights. The plans and schemes of the Government of India, such as “Digital India” and “Skill India”, are expected to spread entrepreneurship and skill development, thus contributing to creation of employment opportunities.By Mr. Kavi Arora, CEO & MD, Religare Finvest",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/trends/features/â€˜govt-taking-efforts-to-strengthen-sme-financingâ€™-1110565.html,Research,"These available options currently cater to the financing need of a very small segment of the total universe and there is still a huge demand supply gap which needs to be plugged through innovative financing options and timely capital infusion.The current lender-borrower relationship is plagued by issues such as:Collateral Issue - Unavailability of desired/acceptable collaterals or unwillingness to mortgage family owned assets.Interest cost – High cost of raising funds.Management of funds - Mismanagement of short term and long term assets resulting in doubtful sustainability.Unavailability of Credit Rating.Lack of technical expertise in information sharing and proposal development leading to failure in generation of required interest and confidence amongst lenders.Asymmetry in available financial information on Business.The landscape of the Indian SME sector has changed over the period of years.formulated schemes like Collateral free loan up to INR 1 cr.Funding for working capital gaps are available via various credit lines like bill discounting, traditional bank overdraft, securitization of receivables, working capital term loan, factoring finance and short term trade finance.For export business owners, there are pre-shipment and post-shipment credits available to take care of the foreign exchange exposure against receivables.For capital expenditure (capex) and long term expansions, banks and NBFCs offers collateral based term loans (Loan against Property) and operating/financial lease options.If they are looking at equity based funding then -            Angel and Venture Capital-              Private Equity (PE) funds for higher ticket size requirements-              Access to funds through SME Exchanges.The emerging economic scenario in the country has thrown open vast opportunities for development and diversification of the MSME Sector.","['Collateral Issue - Unavailability', 'Credit Rating', 'SME', 'Venture', 'SME Exchanges']",[]

India always has had a strong tradition of knowledge. Our knowledge system offer tremendous scope for research involving land-to-lab investigation and lab-to-land transfer of technology. It is important that the vast repository of indigenous knowledge is protected, documented and preserved in active collaboration with prominent practitioners of traditional knowledge.”As part of Hon’ble President’s speech he said, “At the outset, let me congratulate all the award winners for their work and contribution in the field of innovation. I take this opportunity to also compliment the National Innovation Foundation (NIF) - India for unleashing the creative potential of the grassroots innovators and for championing the cause of inclusive innovation through its various initiatives. In particular, I would like to place on record my high appreciation for the outstanding contribution of Prof. Mashelkar and Prof. Anil Gupta in making innovation take the shape of a movement in our country.”He further said, “Innovation is the key to progress and prosperity. There are many social needs that public, private and civil society institutions have not been able to meet fully. At the same time, there is tremendous ingenuity amongst the people, which if tapped, could address the necessities of the common man. Much as the blooming of the spring, the innovations by local communities, students, farmers and others could bring smiles on the faces of millions of our people.”The President said building viable linkages between formal and informal sectors also call for deepening the involvement of the leaders of technological, financial and educational sectors with the creativity of common people and young students. A Festival of Innovation has been started at the Rashtrapati Bhavan this year. It will help to provide a platform to bring different stakeholders together and make these entities active partners in inclusive innovation. The innovators participating in this programme have come from various parts of our country. I hope that an empathetic value chain for disseminating good ideas can be built upon this initiative.The President said India has the potential to be at the forefront of innovation. The encouraging steps in this direction notwithstanding, our country lags behind many others. India is ranked 76th in the Global Innovation Index 2014, much below China which is at the 29th position. Even Russia, at the 49th place and Brazil at 61, performed better than us.The President called upon all the innovators present here to continue generating ingenious solutions to overcome poverty, create employment and make the society healthier, happier and harmonious.On the occasion, a total of 41 awards were given to 40 innovators and 6 communities. The President gave away 16 National, one lifetime achievement and one posthumous award.After the award ceremony the President also inaugurated the Innovation Exhibition at Rashtrapati Bhavan. This will remain open for the public till 13th March, 2015.As a part of the discussions and deliberations it was agreed upon that the process of innovation converts knowledge into social good and economic wealth. It encourages the engagement of talent with the society to improve the quality of life. India always has had a strong tradition of knowledge. Our knowledge system offer tremendous scope for research involving land-to-lab investigation and lab-to-land transfer of technology. It is important that the vast repository of indigenous knowledge is protected, documented and preserved in active collaboration with prominent practitioners of traditional knowledge.The Hon’ble President was also of the view that “inclusive development is possible only when ideas and innovations of common people are supported whole-heartedly. Building viable linkages between formal and informal sectors also call for deepening the involvement of the leaders of technological, financial and educational sectors with the creativity of common people and young students. A Festival of Innovation has been started at the Rashtrapati Bhavan this year. It will help to provide a platform to bring different stakeholders together and make these entities active partners in inclusive innovation.As a part of Festival of Innovation, the Innovation Exhibition is showcasing novel solutions to problems in multiple domains such as engineering, agriculture, health and other socio-economic sectors. These innovations are aimed at improving productivity and efficiency, and enhancing affordability and environmental quality. They provide a veritable impetus to the ‘Make in India’ mission in our country. The Hon’ble President said that “apart from developing appropriate linkages with investors, entrepreneurs and financial institutions, the Union and State governments should also consider taking up these innovations for wider diffusion through their administrative channels, particularly in economically backward regions, and tribal and remote areas.”He further said that, “in this context, it is only appropriate that agricultural universities, public sector R&D laboratories, IITs and NITs are supporting the NIF in validating and value-adding grassroots technologies. Even then, NIF faces a potent challenge in scouting more women innovators and outstanding traditional knowledge holders. I am sure that with sustained effort, NIF will overcome these hurdles. Greater involvement of crucial stakeholders will provide the stimulus required for inclusive growth and development.”To promote and nurture the creative potential of India, the Rashtrapati Bhavan has been opened for innovation scholars, writers, artists, scholars from NITs and inspired teachers. The second batch of innovation scholars, writers and artists joined the In-Residence Programme.On the next day, speaking on the occasion, Secretary to the President, Smt. Omita Paul stated that one creative mind can unleash a flood of creativity and prosperity. She said that it was her belief that the youth will rise to the occasion and take up the responsibility of bringing about change and extending the frontiers of knowledge in order to build an inclusive society. She said that the endeavour to set up Innovation Clubs was in order that they will help not only to bring out the needs of the local areas but the solutions to those problems as well.Nobel Laureate, Prof. Muhammad Yunus also addressed the gathering and shared his experiences regarding Grameen Bank. There were presentations by Innovation Clubs of Babasaheb Bhimrao Ambedkar University, Lucknow, IISER, Mohali, IIT Indore, NIT Silchar and Mahatma Gandhi Antarrashtriya Hindi Vishwavidyalaya, Wardha.

Green Grassroots Innovation: Solar Laminator,09 March,"This year again the Festival of Innovations (FOIN 2015) is all set to acknowledge, appreciate and encourage the culture of innovation amongst all sections of society, specially focusing on grassroot innovations From 7th to 13th March 2015 at Rashtrapati Bhavan. Amandeep Singh of Rajasthan, India once couldn't get an important document laminated because of power cut in his locality and that made his innovative mind to think about this problem. Amandeep, a class X student at that time could think of using the solar energy for running laminator but his thought remained a mere idea until he got an opportunity to realize it when he participated in a district level science fair in class XII. He studied a solar cooker and an electric laminator to come up with the solar laminator.This year again the Festival of Innovations (FOIN 2015) is all set to acknowledge, appreciate and encourage the culture of innovation amongst all sections of society, specially focusing on grassroot innovations From 7th to 13th March 2015 at Rashtrapati Bhavan. Features and working of the solar laminatorThe solar laminator is quite simple and consists of a wooden box, four rollers, a mirror, a mirror stand, a handle, glass and a couple of two mm thick iron sheets. The glasses are fitted so that it focuses the solar energy on the metallic plates. The machine is based on heating the filament of the laminator using black box concept.The solar laminator is as good as the electric laminator in its output.The machine gives a good quality of wrinkle free lamination and does the lamination on both the sides of the sheet in a single pass. The machine takes 15 minutes in laminating an A4 size document.The machine is useful for the areas where there are frequent power cuts or there is no power available. The machine can also be run using electricity when the sunlight is not available.Support and recognition for the grassroots innovationAmandeep has showcased his innovation in various competitions and science fairs at various levels since its first show in his class XII science fair and has been winning awards and accolades for it. He won the first prize in his state and an appreciation award at the national level science fair, ""Jawahar Lal Nehru Rashtriya Vigyan Pradarshani"".National Innovation Foundation (NIF) a nonprofit autonomous body under the Department of Science and Technology has recognized and supported Amandeep's solar laminator.It has also awarded the green grassroots innovation in its biennial competition for unaided green grassroots innovations and traditional knowledge. NIF is also helping Amandeep financially in improving his innovation.This year too many innovators will be recognized and rewarded as a part of FOIN 2015. SME Step-up is proud to be associated with this event and will be reporting action and inspiration from Rashtrapati Bhavan as a part of this innovative initiative of money control.NIF has proved that Indian innovators can match anyone in the world when it comes to solving problems creatively, where they perform better than rest is in generating greater sustainable alternatives by using local resources frugally.

Google set to fly high in Indian skies with Loon,13 February,"Code-named Project Loon, Google’s internet project envisages use of high-altitude balloons to provide affordable internet to around five billion people globally who currently have no access.Google said it was working with the Indian government to bring its balloon-powered internet and its kite-powered wind energy to the country.""By 2016, we believe we can start to launch a commercial format that allows us to have coverage on every square inch of planet Earth. We are working very closely with telecom providers and governments across the world including India to see how we bring this innovation here,"" said Mohammad Gawdat, VP of business Innovation at Google X, a semi-secret facility of Google's that is dedicated to making major technological advancements.The balloons travel 20km above the Earth's surface, in the stratosphere. Loon uses software algorithms to determine where the balloon needs to go depending on the direction of the wind. It started as a pilot some two years back when 30 balloons were launched from New Zealand's South Island that beamed internet to a small group of users.Gawdat, who previously co-founded more than 15 businesses and serves as a board member for several startups, feels that incremental technology adoption wouldn't contribute to solving the massive internet access issue. ""The reason I say that is because in doing incremental technology, the economics works against that. You will spend billions of dollars in deploying telecom towers. For instance, if you have a disaster like a tsunami, all of the telecom infrastructure would be destroyed and it would take 4-5 months to restore it fully,"" he said.Google is also working on a wind power project. The company recently built an aeroplane-like kite tethered up to 300 metres to do a manoeuvre aided by the direction of the wind. The kite's movements generate power. ""We believe through this we should be able to get a 100% improvement on the current renewable technology out there. It will be available at a much cheaper cost,"" Gawdat said.It hopes to begin production in 2016.

"Past, present & future of technology â€“ All under one roof!",22 October,"Avinash IyerIf there was one place where the past, present and future of technology had converged last week, it was at GE India’s TechMela, held on 18th and 19th October in Bengaluru’s Whitefield. This annual event celebrates the best innovations and technologies to have come out of GE India’s technology centre, the company’s largest multi-disciplinary Research and Development facility.From the laser entrance that amused both kids and adults alike to the various stalls that were testimony to GE’s technological brilliance, the event was nothing short of a carnival.Model windmills and a wind farm adorned the Power & Water stall and next to this stood the majestic Jenbacher J316 gas engine. The wind farm particularly drew a lot of visitors as it demonstrated wind energy generation using GE’s optimization technologies.“What we are showcasing here (in TechMela) is the history of electricity and then getting into our heavy-duty gas turbine portfolio…,” said Mariasundaram Antony, General Manager, India Engineering, GE Power & Water. He added, “We are also showcasing some of the wind turbine technologies which we are doing for the globe as well as for the region.” Antony also spoke of the 1.7-103 wind turbine that GE has developed specifically for India’s low-wind speed conditions.Another stall that was buzzing with activity was the Healthcare one. This year was of great significance as GE Healthcare had completed 25 years of innovation. With its motto being ‘At work for a healthier India’, GE has been tirelessly working to upgrade the standard of healthcare in the country. By making locally relevant products, the company has sought to overcome the unique healthcare challenges that a country as vast as India presents.  “We are focused on four segments: mother & child care, cardiology, oncology and peri-operative care. Now the reason we have picked these four segments is that out of 6 billion people who live in the world, about 4 billion people have absolutely no access to any form of scientific healthcare,” said Vikram Damodaran, Director, Innovation, GE Healthcare India.  Among the healthcare products on display were ultrasound machines, C-arm, which is a movable X-Ray imaging machine and the Cortex ID suite that helps in early detection of Alzheimer’s.  “We want to create technologies at the right price models without compromising on clinical efficiencies, so that we improve cost, we improve access. That’s the basic philosophy,“ said Shyam Rajan, Chief Technology Officer, GE Healthcare, India.As adults curiously went from stall to stall to soak in as much knowledge as they could, kids were having a great time too. From dressing up as scientists to getting entertained by a juggler, there was not a dull moment for them at the TechMela.While the Oil & Gas stall gave you an idea of GE’s presence in India’s energy sector, the aviation one depicted how the company was helping India soar high into the skies. “We have a very proud heritage of innovation and that’s what we are trying to showcase. It (The stall) truly showcases the exciting technologies that engineers developed worldwide for GE Aviation and for our customers,” said Alok Nanda, General Manager, GE Aviation.In keeping with the theme of TechMela, ie past, present and future, the Transportation section displayed the evolution of locomotives.  There was also a stall dedicated to PACE (Patents and Analytics Center of Excellence) that provided visitors with an insight into the patenting system. For those who were curious to see how their digital versions looked, there was an artist right there sketching people’s digital caricatures.All in all, GE India’s TechMela was an event where technology, fun, innovation and curiosity mixed in equal measure and ended up leaving an ever-lasting impression on people’s minds.(Image courtesy: GE India Tech Centre's Twitter handle)To know more about GE's technologies, visit GE Step Ahead",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/trends/features/past-presentfuturetechnology-â€“-all-under-one-roof-1534035.html,Research,"This annual event celebrates the best innovations and technologies to have come out of GE India’s technology centre, the company’s largest multi-disciplinary Research and Development facility.From the laser entrance that amused both kids and adults alike to the various stalls that were testimony to GE’s technological brilliance, the event was nothing short of a carnival.Model windmills and a wind farm adorned the Power & Water stall and next to this stood the majestic Jenbacher J316 gas engine.He added, “We are also showcasing some of the wind turbine technologies which we are doing for the globe as well as for the region.” Antony also spoke of the 1.7-103 wind turbine that GE has developed specifically for India’s low-wind speed conditions.Another stall that was buzzing with activity was the Healthcare one.","['GE India’s', 'Research and Development', 'GE', 'the Power & Water', 'GE', 'Healthcare']",[]

"Johnny Vs Amber review: When a relationship goes horribly wrong, is recording one another really therapy?",28 May,"The headlines were big, bold and awful: ‘Johnny Depp loses out on his role in the Harry Potter franchise!’, and ‘Johnny Depp loses his role as Jack Sparrow in the Pirates movie!’ You wondered why, what and how this had happened to an actor who had fabulous movies like Fear And Loathing In Las Vegas and Donnie Brasco under his belt, not to mention the hugely popular Pirates of the Caribbean franchise. And Amber Heard! What a beautiful model, and actor (though I must admit that I had never really heard of her until I reviewed Rum Diaries).***Johnny Vs Amber, a two part documentary on Discovery+, sifts through the mountain of evidence in the Johnny Depp versus Amber Heard defamation case, to look at both sides of the story. (No verdict was reached in the case on May 27 and the jury is expected to return for deliberations on May 31, 2022.)But why make a documentary about a trial that was publicly broadcast and widely followed globally, you ask?For audiences like you and me who want to know more than just the juicy ‘goss’, who care for a woman who may have been wronged, and also worry about the guy who cares enough to wear the Jack Sparrow costume and visit the hospital and bring joy to children suffering from cancer.The truth perhaps lies somewhere in-between, but the documentary has insights from lawyers, friends and media persons. In addition to the lawyers who represent both Johnny Depp and Amber Heard, it takes inputs from the hotshot lawyer who represented the tabloid that Johnny Depp was suing.The interest in the lives of Johnny Depp and Amber Heard is not just about mad fans screaming for justice. We watch because we are fascinated by people who seem to be perfect, have relationships that seem to be perfect that we cannot wrap our heads around when ugly facets of their lives are revealed. When Brittney Spears was fighting to regain control of her life, we saw how harsh and unfair the terms of her conservatorship were. She lost so much money to her father’s and her estate’s lawyers…Johnny Vs Amber is non-judgemental. If you see lawyers finding fault with one side or the other and the media persons explain why, it is the friends who speak up for both Johnny and Amber and make the case for me.How did a non Hollywood born actor who earned so much fame just up and leave his family, his marriage of 14 years with Vanessa Paradis? What did he see in Amber Heard? Why did a young Amber fall for a much older man in Hollywood and give in to the May-December trope that everyone looks down on? Did she need his support in her career? These are just questions that make you think when you watch the trial unfolding live online. This documentary has perfect timing.The documentary starts with Johnny Depp suing the British tabloid newspaper The Sun for a headline that screamed: Johnny Depp is a wife beater.With all that Live on YouTube lawsuit that so many of us have been watching, I watched the documentary wanting to see what prompted a very famous man, married to a very famous woman, to break up the marriage when smitten by a younger woman who ‘got into his head’. And boy! I was triggered so many times I had to put a pause on the documentary and get myself a strong cup of coffee.The first part will make you feel awful. How can someone claiming to be a victim change their story so many times and record on video arguments that she started and then claim to be the one who’s been hurt? The story that Johnny Depp is telling appears to be true. She was manipulating him mentally because she could. She was taking advantage of his love and pushing his buttons.The second part, though, shows how the bruises progress. From just a red mark to the black and blue and the darkening and then fading. Is Amber really being hurt by the man who is more powerful in the relationship? What if he’s really jealous of her rising fame and wants to be the ‘famous’ one in the relationship. I was dismayed at the language that Johnny Depp used in text messages to his friend to describe Amber. Yes, someone accidentally shared thousands of text messages from Johnny’s phone that showed how much he disrespected her.Those recordings - both audio and video - are mind-blowing. Although the audio recordings in the documentary will make you believe Johnny who seems to be pleading with Amber: please don’t do this, please don’t let the monster come out. But the video tapes show us Johnny losing his temper and taking it out on the cupboard. If he can kick the furniture, could he have hit Amber the way she has described? Is this what the monster does when it ‘comes out’? One of the videos shows Amber smirking in the ‘gotcha’ moment.How is recording one another secretly and even openly therapy? People say many horrible things to one another in anger. One may be angry and the other calm because they know every word is being recorded. And with both parties being actors, who is to say that the words make sense even when taken out of context and after months and presented in court as evidence?I felt bad for Amber at the disinformation and the smear campaign that was spread against her. Internet trolls can be vicious and we have seen this happen in India to many people. I don’t understand why there were so many fans screaming ‘Justice For Johnny’ and none for Amber. If you watch on YouTube Live from the courtroom where this drama of defamation claims that both have made against one another is playing out, you will realise that both have done awful things to one another. How do people get into such toxic relationships? What is it that keeps them going back to one another and hurting each other again and again? People who believe that unless we learn to forgive the other for whatever karmic debt that we have with them, and ask for forgiveness ourselves, that we will be forced to repeat this cycle of violence. I do hope that both these beautiful people who share such a toxic relationship get some kind of closure.Until then we shall all be the voyeurs and watch the drama unfold on our social media screens.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/trends/entertainment/johnny-vs-amber-review-when-a-relationship-goes-horribly-wrong-is-recording-one-another-really-therapy-8597981.html,Research,"The headlines were big, bold and awful: ‘Johnny Depp loses out on his role in the Harry Potter franchise!’, and ‘Johnny Depp loses his role as Jack Sparrow in the Pirates movie!’ You wondered why, what and how this had happened to an actor who had fabulous movies like Fear And Loathing In Las Vegas and Donnie Brasco under his belt, not to mention the hugely popular Pirates of the Caribbean franchise.)But why make a documentary about a trial that was publicly broadcast and widely followed globally, you ask?For audiences like you and me who want to know more than just the juicy ‘goss’, who care for a woman who may have been wronged, and also worry about the guy who cares enough to wear the Jack Sparrow costume and visit the hospital and bring joy to children suffering from cancer.The truth perhaps lies somewhere in-between, but the documentary has insights from lawyers, friends and media persons.",[],[]
Netflix’s stumble could be a warning sign for streaming industry,21 April,"Many entertainment executives, tired of playing catch-up to a Silicon Valley interloper, have been waiting for the comeuppance of Netflix. But this may not have been the way they hoped it would happen.Netflix said this week that it lost more subscribers than it signed up in the first three months of the year, reversing a decade of steady growth. The company’s shares nose-dived 35% Wednesday while it shed about $50 billion in market capitalization. The pain was shared across the industry as the stock of companies like Disney, Warner Bros. Discovery and Paramount also declined.Netflix blamed a number of issues, ranging from increased competition to its decision to drop all its subscribers in Russia because of the war in Ukraine. To entertainment executives and analysts, the moment felt decisive in the so-called streaming wars. After years of trying, they may see a chance to gain ground on their giant rival.But Netflix’s stunning reversal also raised a number of questions that will have to be answered in the coming months as more traditional media companies race toward subscription businesses largely modeled after what Netflix created. Is there such a thing as too many streaming options? How many people are really willing to pay for them? And could this business be less profitable and far less reliable than what the industry has been doing for years?“They switched from a sound business model to an unsound one,” veteran entertainment executive Barry Diller said Wednesday, referring to many legacy companies that have recently debuted streaming options. “I would guess today they’re saying, ‘Maybe trees don’t grow to the skies.’”The media industry, worried about declining movie theater ticket sales and broadcast television ratings, has been reshaping itself on the fly to go all-in on streaming and compete with Netflix. Disney has invested billions. Discovery Inc. and WarnerMedia completed a merger this month to better compete with streaming behemoths. CNN even introduced a streaming version of itself, which has so far drawn underwhelming interest from subscribers.But Netflix’s sudden problems show that those investments come with a lot of risk. The streaming market may still be a giant one over the long term, but the next few years could be difficult, said Rich Greenfield, an analyst at LightShed Partners and a longtime streaming booster.“No matter what, it looks far less profitable, and that’s a problem for everybody,” he said. Fewer subscribers coupled with increased costs because of fiercer competition to create original content mean less profit for everyone.Another concern, some analysts say, is the so-called churn rate. Consumers are growing warier of rising prices for streaming services and becoming more likely to cancel a service when a favorite show comes to an end, said Kevin Westcott, vice chairman of consulting firm Deloitte. According to Deloitte, 25% of U.S. customers have canceled a streaming service only to resubscribe to it within a year.“They’re frustrated that they have to have so many subscriptions to get all the content they want,” Westcott said.Netflix’s issues increase pressure on Disney, which will report subscriber numbers May 11. If Disney’s figures fail to live up to expectations, the distress signals surrounding the streaming business will grow louder.There was also fear among Hollywood talent agents Wednesday that the Netflix gravy train could slow and that the company’s willingness to pay whatever it took for scripts and talent deals could vanish. The same went for producers. Netflix has spent hundreds of millions of dollars over the past five years in pursuit of Academy Awards. It has yet to nab a best picture Oscar, but its commitment to prestige filmmaking has been praised.“The effect on us will be if the new reality forces them to cut back on their $17 billion-a-year programming budget,” said Michael Shamberg, whose four-part documentary on the Three Mile Island nuclear plant crisis will debut on Netflix next month. “As a producer, I always think of them as a first stop for pitching original ideas. If their subscriber growth levels off and it forces them to cut back on programming, will they stop taking risks on innovative TV shows and Oscar films?”Netflix acknowledged that ferocious competition was partly a reason that growth had stalled. The company used to say its primary competition was not from other streaming services but from diversions like sleep and reading.Now there is a question about whether Netflix’s original content is strong enough to set it apart, as even deeper-pocketed companies like Apple and Amazon continue to increase their spending on critically acclaimed shows like “Severance,” which is carried on Apple TV+, and the upcoming first season of a “Lord of the Rings” prequel, for which Amazon is said to be spending more than $450 million.“The reality is with so much alternative content out there, where is the new stuff that is just crushing it? Where are the new franchises?” asked Greenfield, the analyst. He noted that popular shows like “Ozark,” “Stranger Things” and “The Crown” would soon be ending their runs.Indeed, interest in Netflix’s vast library has been showing signs of plateauing.“For every single title on the Netflix catalog, the demand is pretty much flat,” said Alejandro Rojas, vice president of applied analytics at Parrot Analytics, a research firm. “The catalog for HBO Max and Disney+ is growing double digits. That’s a big difference.”Netflix’s performance could also cause rivals to reconsider their own international expansion plans, potentially making more targeted efforts overseas. Netflix’s subscriptions declined not just in the United States and Canada but also in Europe and Latin America.“Netflix has thrown the kitchen sink at this,” industry analyst Michael Nathanson said. “They were a first mover. They spent a ton on content, and they are making more localized content. They’ve done the right things and yet they’ve hit a wall.”Netflix executives, normally self-assured, seemed notably unsteady Tuesday, when the first-quarter results were released. Co-CEO Reed Hastings, who once swore there would never be ads on Netflix, said the company would consider introducing a lower-priced, advertising-supported tier in the next year or two. Netflix also said it would crack down on password sharing, a practice that in the past it said it had no problem with.“We’ve been thinking about that for a couple of years, but when we were growing fast it wasn’t a high priority to work on,” Hastings said. “And now, we’re working superhard on it.”Netflix has no advertising sales experience, while rivals like Disney, Warner Bros. Discovery and Paramount have vast advertising infrastructure. And the password crackdown led some analysts to wonder whether Netflix has already reached market saturation in the United States.Hastings tried to reassure everyone that Netflix had been through tough times before and that it would solve its problems. He said the company was now “superfocused” on “getting back into our investors’ good graces.”This article originally appeared in The New York Times.By John Koblin and Nicole Sperling",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/companies/netflixs-stumble-could-be-a-warning-sign-for-streaming-industry-8388611.html,Research,"If Disney’s figures fail to live up to expectations, the distress signals surrounding the streaming business will grow louder.There was also fear among Hollywood talent agents Wednesday that the Netflix gravy train could slow and that the company’s willingness to pay whatever it took for scripts and talent deals could vanish.The company used to say its primary competition was not from other streaming services but from diversions like sleep and reading.Now there is a question about whether Netflix’s original content is strong enough to set it apart, as even deeper-pocketed companies like Apple and Amazon continue to increase their spending on critically acclaimed shows like “Severance,” which is carried on Apple TV+, and the upcoming first season of a “Lord of the Rings” prequel, for which Amazon is said to be spending more than $450 million.“The reality is with so much alternative content out there, where is the new stuff that is just crushing it?","['Disney', 'Netflix', 'Apple', 'Amazon', 'Apple', 'Rings', 'Amazon']","['about $50 billion', 'billions.', 'hundreds of millions of dollars', '$17 billion', 'more than $450 million']"
"Dark Mysteries review: Heebie jeebies, because truth is stranger than fiction",12 February,"No matter how educated you are, how rational you claim to be, there’s something about stories of sorcery, witches, tall ghosts with lights, people possessed, places that repel visitors, shamans, tantrics, temples for exorcism and events that are inexplicable have always fascinated us. discovery+ should air these six episodes called Dark Mysteries with a disclaimer: do not watch when you’re alone and if it’s late into the night.Seemingly innocuous, the first episode of Dark Mysteries starts off with two stories of reincarnation. Of course, we’ve all had a great laugh at men trying to evade taxes by claiming to be the reincarnation of Radha. We’ve all laughed also at news articles about men who claim to have been kidnapped by aliens and lost all memory just to evade being caught in an extramarital affair. So when two kids insist that they are different and seem to want to meet their real family, you think they’re doing that to avoid homework.But there are two kids who remember more than just their names from a past life. They remember horrific details about how they lost their lives and things you’d know only if you were a part of the family. Hard to believe, but there they are! This story takes us to two separate villages in Haryana and Uttar Pradesh.It’s the second episode that begins to take you to places you’d best stay away from. It takes you to the hills near Dehradun: Lambi Dehar Mines, and to Srinagar’s Dal Lake. You’ve been to Srinagar and perhaps even stayed in a houseboat. But did you know strange deaths have happened in this beautiful lake? Imagine hearing about something strange upturning a boat and people being sucked into the depths? Or a strange apparition of a tall man draped in white staring at your boat… And Mussoorie and Dehradun hills? How many times has one driven down from Delhi on those winding roads? But there are abandoned buildings of an abandoned mine inhabited by ghosts of miners and the ghost of a woman? Imagine that a man trained in paranormal things Akshay Sthalekar feels like something is pushing him away from this evil, sad place?The third episode is about two abandoned places: Kuldhara in Rajasthan and Talakadu in Karnataka. How do you apologise for a woman who was chased for her jewellery by soldiers and she vanished into the river after cursing? This episode will make you think hard about curses and picking up mementos from places that have history. Remember reading the TinTin comic called Seven Crystal Balls where the Rascar Capac mummy curses the archaeologists who dug up the tomb? But this is real, and a historian and archaeologist from Aligarh Muslim University, Dr Rezavi, knows that there’s something bad in the abandoned village that they brought back when they did not heed the warning about not touching a single stone from Kuldhara. Also, movie-mad people will love the fact that there really lived a person called Zalim Singh.The fourth episode will remind you about little newspaper ads you have seen or posters stuck on walls and trains about Baba Bengali and black magic. This episode is scary, so make sure there are no kids watching the show. Purulia in West Bengal has cases of women suffering from strange afflictions and only a visit and efforts by Tantric priests have cured them of the black magic that binds them. What was horrible was a scene where the tantric priest performs some ceremony for the younger brother who had been cheated of ancestral property by his older brother, and surprise, the older brother when driving with his family dies in an accident. How matter of fact can you be?There’s a temple in Bihar’s Chainpur in the fifth episode where they exorcise spirits that have possessed people’s bodies. This temple of ‘Baba Harsudham’ (actually pause the video and discover the name of the temple is ‘Baba Harsu Brahm Dham’. Perhaps the very non-Indian voiceover and the writer did not get it right). The priests there help a singer get back her voice and help a young man driven crazy by spirits occupying his body. The second part of the episode is about shamans in Uttarakhand who solve local problems.Last (in the first instalment) but not the least is the story of black magic to harm people. One is in Aligarh where an entire family of an up and coming businessman suffers because someone is jealous of his success. He’s Muslim and the maulana helps him figure out how the black magic was done. He also takes heed of the warning given to him by an Aghori ascetic. A young woman attends the funeral prayer in her own home and the spirit of the dead relative enters her body making her fragile and weak.

"First ever true millipede with over 1,000 feet found in Australia",16 December,"Scientists have discovered the world's first true millipede, a study said Thursday, describing a long, thin, and segmented creature with a whopping 1,306 legs -- more than any other animal ever.Worm-like creepy critters with hundreds of legs are commonly known as millipedes, a name that roughly translates to ""thousand feet"" -- but until now none has ever been found with more than 750.The record-setting species was discovered 60 metres underground in a drill hole in a mining area in Western Australia and has been dubbed Eumillipes persephone.""The species name is from the Greek mythological goddess of the underworld, Persephone, who was originally from the surface but was taken to the underworld by Hades,"" study author Paul Marek of Virginia Tech University told AFP.The string-like creature is less than a millimetre wide but nearly 10 centimetres long and has ""a cone-shaped head with enormous antennae and a beak for feeding"", the study says.It also has no eyes and is colourless, traits characteristic of animals that spend their entire lives underground.""The millipede burrows by stretching out its extensible body thereby making it thinner to fit small cracks,"" Marek said.""The many legs propel the body and force open small fissures and crevices.""Commenting on the findings, insect specialist Andre Nel, who was not involved in the research, described the new critter as remarkable.""In cavity-dwelling insects you usually find elongated legs, rather than elongated bodies,"" he told AFP.He added that the discovery was a hopeful one for biodiversity, especially in an area that has probably been damaged by mining activity.""It recolonised artificial cavities, which is pretty encouraging,"" Nel said.He said the so-called micro-cavities are a largely unknown habitat where new species are often discovered.""There is probably a whole range of animal life to discover in the area,"" he said.Millipedes were some of the earliest air-breathing animals on Earth, the study notes, and some extinct species grew to be over two metres long.They play a vital role in the ecosystems they inhabit by eating detritus and recycling nutrients.Baby millipedes hatch with just four legs but can continue to grow new segments with new legs into adulthood.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/science/first-ever-true-millipede-with-over-1000-feet-found-in-australia-7834371.html,Research,"Scientists have discovered the world's first true millipede, a study said Thursday, describing a long, thin, and segmented creature with a whopping 1,306 legs -- more than any other animal ever.Worm-like creepy critters with hundreds of legs are commonly known as millipedes, a name that roughly translates to ""thousand feet"" -- but until now none has ever been found with more than 750.The record-setting species was discovered 60 metres underground in a drill hole in a mining area in Western Australia and has been dubbed Eumillipes persephone.""The species name is from the Greek mythological goddess of the underworld, Persephone, who was originally from the surface but was taken to the underworld by Hades,"" study author Paul Marek of Virginia Tech University told AFP.The string-like creature is less than a millimetre wide but nearly 10 centimetres long and has ""a cone-shaped head with enormous antennae and a beak for feeding"", the study says.It also has no eyes and is colourless, traits characteristic of animals that spend their entire lives underground.","['Western Australia', 'Persephone', 'Hades', 'Virginia Tech University']",[]
Review | 'India’s Space Odyssey' reminds me of Films Division newsreels of yore,07 October,"Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro) is the only government agency in India that’s made a profit of Rs 5,600 crore from 2016 to 2018.Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru, Vikram Sarabhai and Homi Bhabha created Isro under the Department of Atomic Energy (DAE) in 1962. Until 1969, the agency was called INCOSPAR: Indian National Committee for Space Research and it split). Ever since its formal inception in 1969, Isro has launched 100 spacecraft missions, 70 launch missions, nine student satellites, two re-entry missions, and 269 foreign satellites of 32 countries.These are impressive numbers. Yet the Discovery+ documentary on Isro does not have such awesomeness. Instead, it follows an interview format with G. Madhavan Nair, former head of Isro; Anuradha T.K., the celebrated head of missions, a space historian; and journalists with footage and animation of rockets and satellites. It’s got fabulous information, no doubt, but this is 2021! Why do we get the feeling that school kids will troop into the auditorium and be forced to watch it.It gets me asking, ‘Why are lessons for the UPSC exams about Isro on YouTube sharper and smarter than this documentary?’It’s like Discovery+ was sitting on a goldmine, and then decided to just concentrate on the local tea shop outside the mine instead. Come to think of it, even the tea shop scene in Kala Patthar (a movie that is set in a coal mine) is more memorable and better written.If you are a space nerd, you probably love the animation of satellites unfurling their solar panels like wings. Movies with astronauts repairing a stuck arm leave you stunned, no matter how many times you watch the scenes. Chandrayaan 1 also had nail biting sessions of a unmanned mission that settled into orbit rather than directly landing in the trajectory. The documentary does not show us the nail-biting moments, but tells us about them, with rows of scientists in the mission control room either raising their fists in the air out of joy, or looking down morosely. I want to say to the makers, take your time, your audience is hooked by the very name!The show is named Indian Space Odyssey, and we space nerds hope that it will tell us all about Isro like Homer told us about Odysseus’ journey across the oceans. How could they forget that we grew up on the never-ending Sunday Morning Star Trek shows about the voyages of the Spaceship Enterprise, boldly going where no man (now they say ‘no one’) has gone before… And today’s generation has watched and discussed movies like Interstellar and Jodie Foster’s Contact for years. Give us more details, I say, give us more!And Isro has had amazing successes. We have loved the stories and the books about scientists riding bicycles with the payload, and rockets being transported in bullock carts. This documentary just touches on this awesomeness for a throwaway fact. Perhaps someone decided that too much has been written about it, and it doesn’t deserve more than a passing mention.But it was superb to learn about Thumbi, and how the priest asked the faithful if they’d let the scientists assemble a rocket in the church. How cool is that! The documentary says that Thumbi is the best place to study cosmic phenomena, but what are we doing there today? I am convinced that there are many tales like the church which we haven’t heard which could have been included! More research needed, I say!Isro has so many female scientists that there were not one but two movies made on them. Surely the documentary that celebrates 60 years of Isro could have used the fact with pride?Squadron Leader Rakesh Sharma who made everyone’s hearts swell with pride and gave us goosebumps (we were wide-eyed kids) when he replied, ‘Saare jahan se accha!’ to the then Prime Minister’s question, ‘What does India look like from space?’ He just shows up as his older version talking about that historic flight without any fanfare. Most of us wanted to be like him when we were kids, and I did not even recognise the man!If we’re talking rocket science, then shouldn’t there be talk of spies? Isro scientist S. Nambi Narayanan and his deputy, plus the Indian representative of Soviet company Glavkosmos were arrested because a Maldivian woman (Rasheeda) and her companion told the cops that these scientists had sold ‘super secret’ cryogenic technology to Pakistan. The event changed the way we deal with technology and how the world looks at India. Missile technology is now under the defence department, and as the space historian Siddique explains in the film, the deal with the Soviets had fallen through and Nambi Narayanan was brought in to develop this technology indigenously. So there were no secrets to sell, nor could this cumbersome cryogenic technology launch military grade missiles.This huge story is told so badly that I’m grateful that R. Madhavan (who narrates the documentary in Hindi) is making a movie on Nambi Narayanan called Rocketry: The Nambi Effect (slated for release in April 2022).We see more footage of politicians in this film than the men and women who make Isro such an amazing organisation. And not a word about what a momentous journey of 60 years this has been. I am sure the filmmakers have more historic footage than they have used. It should have been a celebration of an agency that has put India on the world map dominated by the US, Russia, China, Japan and the EU, but the documentary looks like a last-minute anniversary present.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/trends/entertainment/review-indias-space-odyssey-will-remind-you-of-films-division-newsreels-of-yore-7555211.html,Research,"Why do we get the feeling that school kids will troop into the auditorium and be forced to watch it.It gets me asking, ‘Why are lessons for the UPSC exams about Isro on YouTube sharper and smarter than this documentary?’It’s like Discovery+ was sitting on a goldmine, and then decided to just concentrate on the local tea shop outside the mine instead.So there were no secrets to sell, nor could this cumbersome cryogenic technology launch military grade missiles.This huge story is told so badly that I’m grateful that R.

"Review | 'Money Mafia': Episode 1 feels like a 30-minute teaser on the Rs 32,000 crore Telgi Stamp Paper Scam",04 August,"‘We could recover only 100 crore worth of property,' says R. Srikumar, chief of the investigating team (retired DG Police, Karnataka). According to the reports, Abdul Karim Telgi started out as just a simple fruit seller at the Khanapur railway platform (Belgaum now Belagavi district of Karnataka) with his brothers. But he was not happy selling fruit and peanuts to the passengers of the 12 trains that stopped at the station. He completed his education, and took his dreams of getting rich quickly to Bombay (Mumbai).***We are remote-control warriors. We live by laws, and have grown up to fear the wrath of the all-knowing Gods and Karma. Perhaps that is why we watch shows like Scam 1992 and Bad Boy Billionaires (which tell us how Vijay Mallya, Nirav Modi, and Subrata Roy got away with their schemes and plans), and movies like The Big Bull. When Satyam sues Netflix and they do not air that episode, we seek out details elsewhere. We are obsessed with people who make millions, and we secretly love it when they are caught doing something wrong. I watch these shows obsessively, and wonder why even men like John Delorean, who designed a beautiful car, was happy to fuel his extravagant lifestyle by skimming off his own company, thousands of people working in a war torn city, and even governments. What drives them?So when Discovery+ chose to air Money Mafia, I watched with complete attention. The story of mind-bending scam hatched and run successfully for years by a fruit seller absorbed me.Fun fact from the journalist this documentary credits as someone who investigated the scam - Mandar Parab: Everyone thinks that we send criminals to jail to repent and become better citizens. Far from the truth. Petty criminals meet hardened criminals, and they form teams and plan even more crimes.Reporter Sanjay Singh from Zee who has been acknowledged as the one who broke the story gets no mention at all. And once you begin to wonder why about one fact, then the show sort of unravels.Very dramatically the whistleblower Jayant Tinaikar makes his entry and tells us how he was turned away from every police station because no one believed his story, how he wrote to the then President of India about the scam and so on. I want to know three things that the documentary makers should have asked Tinaikar: how did he hear about the scam? If the forgeries were so good that no one could make out which was real and which was fake, how did Jayant Tinaikar know the stamp papers were fake? Which police officer did finally accept his ‘khabar’ about the fake stamp papers?The documentary would have been ‘cooler’ had they followed up on Ratan Soni who showed Telgi in jail that fake stamp papers were a bigger money making enterprise than forging passports and sending people to the Middle East.YouTube has more information than the documentary does, which is a pity, because you want to know how his need to make money quickly drove him from a failed sales guy in Bombay and in Saudi to someone who could make and sell forged passports and job documents only to be caught by the cops.The documentary says he was charming and well-spoken, and he used that to get people from the Indian Security Press in Nashik to comply with his request for a supposedly ‘junked’ stamp paper printing machine, paper and even the special inks they used to print the stamp papers authorised by the government.The documentary even has interviewed two-time MLA Anil Gote (who has spent four years in prison for counterfeiting) who insists Telgi was the fall guy for politicians and police and bureaucrats who were actually part of the scam. One thing that he said resonated: If the people from the government-authorised printing press were helping him with everything, and Telgi’s associates were stopping the goods trains and stealing boxes of real stamp paper, why would anyone want to print fake ones?A blink and you’ll miss appearance of the female DIG police Rupa Moudgil who reports about Telgi’s lavish lifestyle inside the prison and is transferred immediately afterwards, is never followed through.I loved Telgi’s challenge to the police that he will never tell them about the four Ps: the involvement of the police, the politicians, the press and about the properties that have been converted. But then the documentary doesn’t explain why Telgi begins to spill names of the police officers and others complicit in his scam.All in all, this episode of Money Mafia feels like a very poorly written summary of movies you see on OTT platforms. Will I watch the others in the weekly series? Of course I will!Kudos to Discovery+; they feel new in the game that is dominated by Amazon Prime Video, Netflix and the others, but this is a brave foot in the door. Like I said, who wouldn’t want to make money? But Karma sits besides us, watching us wish for that little windfall, that little more than what we have to pay our bills, and making sure we stick with the straight and narrow.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/trends/entertainment/review-money-mafia-episode-1-feels-like-a-30-minute-teaser-on-the-rs-32000-crore-telgi-stamp-paper-scam-7274941.html,Research,"Which police officer did finally accept his ‘khabar’ about the fake stamp papers?The documentary would have been ‘cooler’ had they followed up on Ratan Soni who showed Telgi in jail that fake stamp papers were a bigger money making enterprise than forging passports and sending people to the Middle East.YouTube has more information than the documentary does, which is a pity, because you want to know how his need to make money quickly drove him from a failed sales guy in Bombay and in Saudi to someone who could make and sell forged passports and job documents only to be caught by the cops.The documentary says he was charming and well-spoken, and he used that to get people from the Indian Security Press in Nashik to comply with his request for a supposedly ‘junked’ stamp paper printing machine, paper and even the special inks they used to print the stamp papers authorised by the government.The documentary even has interviewed two-time MLA Anil Gote (who has spent four years in prison for counterfeiting) who insists Telgi was the fall guy for politicians and police and bureaucrats who were actually part of the scam.One thing that he said resonated: If the people from the government-authorised printing press were helping him with everything, and Telgi’s associates were stopping the goods trains and stealing boxes of real stamp paper, why would anyone want to print fake ones?A blink and you’ll miss appearance of the female DIG police Rupa Moudgil who reports about Telgi’s lavish lifestyle inside the prison and is transferred immediately afterwards, is never followed through.I loved Telgi’s challenge to the police that he will never tell them about the four Ps: the involvement of the police, the politicians, the press and about the properties that have been converted.","['YouTube', 'the Indian Security Press', 'DIG']",[]
How WarnerMedia and Discovery plan to forge a media behemoth,18 May,"                        Anna Nicolaou, Alex Barker and James Fontanella-Khan

Lockdowns spurred many Americans to invest in home renovation projects or new hobbies. For David Zaslav, late-pandemic boredom spawned another idea: buying a $100bn company.

In February, the Discovery chief executive had arranged to play golf with AT&T chief John Stankey at the Pebble Beach Pro-Am tournament in California. But a Covid-19 surge wrecked the plan and Zaslav, “feeling bummed”, sent Stankey an email instead: “Give me a buzz: I got an idea.”

AT&T set to end media voyage with $43 billion Discovery deal,18 May,"AT&T, owner of HBO and Warner Bros studios, and Discovery, home to lifestyle TV networks such as HGTV and TLC, said they will combine their content to form a standalone global entertainment and media business.Discovery Chief Executive David Zaslav will lead the proposed new company, which will comprise one of Hollywood's most powerful studios, including the Harry Potter and Batman franchises, news network CNN, sports programming and Discovery's unscripted home, cooking and nature and science shows.Monday's move marks the unwinding of AT&T's ambitious plan to forge a telecoms and media powerhouse through a flurry of deals including the 2018 $108.7 billion acquisition of US media conglomerate Time Warner and the 2015 purchase of satellite TV service DirecTV for $68 billion.Shares in Discovery climbed about 16 percent to $41.3 in premarket trade but later fell 2 percent as investors digested that it would take time for Discovery to scale up in streaming, Rich Greenfield, partner at LightShed Partners, said.""This company is going to take a year to be in position to take control of the assets,"" he said.

AT&T-Discovery deal would create a media juggernaut,17 May,"Less than three years after AT&T spent more than $85 billion and millions more fending off a government challenge to buy Time Warner, one of the biggest prizes in media, the phone company has decided on a completely different strategy.AT&T is in advanced talks to create a new company that would merge its media business, including CNN, with Discovery Inc., two people briefed on the deal said Sunday. The plan would incorporate all of AT&T’s WarnerMedia assets, which include HBO and Warner Bros., one of the people said. The parties could announce a deal as soon as Monday, this person said, saying that the talks were not yet complete and final details were being worked out.Should AT&T and Discovery agree on a deal, it would join together two of the largest media businesses in the country. AT&T’s WarnerMedia group includes the sports-heavy cable networks TNT and TBS. Discovery has a strong lineup of reality-based cable channels, including Oprah Winfrey’s OWN, HGTV, the Food Network and Animal Planet.WarnerMedia is run by Jason Kilar, 50, one of the early pioneers of streaming and the first chief executive of Hulu. David Zaslav, 60, has been the head of Discovery for 14 years and helped it grow into a reality behemoth. It’s unclear who would lead the new business.AT&T and Discovery declined to comment. Bloomberg News first reported on the possible deal.The transaction would create a new company bigger than Netflix or NBCUniversal. WarnerMedia and Discovery together generated more than $41 billion in sales last year, with an operating profit of more than $10 billion. That would have vaulted the combined company ahead of Netflix and NBCUniversal and behind the Walt Disney Co.In other words, to compete for audiences increasingly glued to Facebook, YouTube or TikTok, media companies need to get even bigger. It could set off another round of media deals.Both AT&T and Discovery have invested heavily in streaming to compete with Netflix and Disney. AT&T has plowed billions into creating HBO Max, a streaming platform that now has about 20 million customers. Discovery has 15 million streaming subscribers around the world, most of them for its Discovery+ app.The merger would also be a significant about-face for AT&T, a telecommunications giant better known for servicing fiber lines and cell towers than producing entertainment and courting Hollywood. Industry experts questioned AT&T’s daring purchase of Time Warner at a time when cord-cutting was only accelerating. The spinoff indicates a failed acquisition strategy.“AT&T didn’t know what they were buying,” said Brian Wieser, a longtime Wall Street analyst. “The strategy underpinning” the acquisition “was probably flawed.”Wieser said AT&T deserved credit for slimming down WarnerMedia’s operations and putting money into HBO Max. Shortly after AT&T closed on the deal in 2018, the company quickly worked to consolidate the media giant’s various divisions, ultimately laying off about 2,000 employees. “They were genuinely reorganizing the business to give it the clarity to be able to compete with Netflix,” he said.At the same time, AT&T is no longer best positioned to continue investing in its media business, Wieser said. The wireless giant is one of the most heavily indebted companies, with long-term debt topping $159 billion. That includes the $23 billion it agreed to spend in February to license additional airwaves for its 5G technology.A rival cellphone carrier, Verizon, has been shedding its media assets as it, too, has had to invest in 5G technology. This month, it sold off Yahoo and AOL to a private equity group, not long after it sold HuffPost to BuzzFeed.John Stankey, the chief executive of AT&T, has looked at its media business as a way to keep its phone customers glued to its cell service. AT&T Wireless subscribers get discounts and free access to HBO Max. A deal with Discovery could include stipulations that would maintain those benefits.Before he took over as chief executive last year, Stankey was known as the company’s chief mergers strategist. But his track record has been spotty. In addition to planning AT&T’s purchase of Time Warner, he was behind the company’s $48 billion acquisition of the satellite operator DirecTV in 2015. The service has been bleeding customers for years; in February, AT&T sold part of the business to the private equity firm TPG for about $16 billion, a third of what it originally paid.For Discovery, the deal could finally give Zaslav the size and scale he has long sought. A swashbuckling executive who can recall ratings figures off the top of his head, Zaslav represents the last of the old guard in media, a hobnobbing mogul known for hosting lavish get-togethers at his house in the Hamptons.A combination with WarnerMedia suggests he may have had a recent change of heart about taking over CNN. In an interview in February with The New York Times media columnist Ben Smith, Zaslav said CNN wouldn’t necessarily make a good fit with Discovery. “News is very overplayed and excoriated here in the U.S.,” he said then.Zaslav remains one of the highest paid executives in the country. In the past three years, his average annual compensation topped $70 million.John Malone, the cable pioneer and one of the fiercest competitors in media (once referred to by Al Gore as “Darth Vader”), is one of Discovery’s biggest investors and a merger with AT&T would be a homecoming of sorts. Malone began his career at the Bell Labs division of AT&T before going on to become one of the biggest cable entrepreneurs in the country.The deal could also benefit Advance Publications, the publisher of Condé Nast, as Discovery’s biggest shareholder.The new company would create a new kind of media behemoth, one that is still living off the fat profits of old-school cable, while spending those profits (and more) on streaming.Even with increased competition, HBO remains a standout in television, and last year, once again, captured more Emmys than any other network, studio or platform, including Netflix. It has several hit shows, including “Succession,” “Curb Your Enthusiasm,” “Barry” and “Last Week Tonight With John Oliver.” It also has a huge library that includes “The Sopranos,” “Game of Thrones” and “Sex and the City.”The Warner Bros. TV studio likewise has produced successful shows for both its parent company, WarnerMedia, and outside studios with series like “Ted Lasso” (Apple TV+), “Riverdale” (CW), “The Flight Attendant” (HBO Max) and “The Bachelor” (ABC). The Warner Bros. movie studio recently released movies like “Godzilla vs. Kong,” “Mortal Kombat” and has big coming releases like “Dune” and “The Matrix 4.”The disruption would extend to Warner Bros., the nearly century-old movie and television studio. It serves as a content engine for HBO Max while also making shows for networks owned by other companies, including ViacomCBS and Disney.At the very least, senior Warner Bros. executives — caught by surprise by Sunday’s news — would have to endure another destabilizing corporate reshuffling; they had just started to get used to one put in place by AT&T.There is also the question of how much producing Warner Bros. will continue to do for outside networks and whether its film-releasing strategy will again change. Since January, AT&T has been releasing all Warner Bros. films simultaneously on HBO Max and in theaters, with plans to return to a more traditional model — first in theaters for an exclusive run followed by availability on HBO Max — in 2022 for its biggest movies.Discovery has long been known for its array of unscripted fare from its cable networks like HGTV, the Food Network, TLC, ID, Animal Planet and the company’s flagship, Discovery. The company introduced a new streaming service in January, built on the backs of cooking shows, nature shows and home improvement shows.But perhaps Discovery’s biggest advantage is its huge footprint in sports internationally. It is the owner of Eurosport, and a combination with Turner would also give it space to run domestically. Turner has rights with Major League Baseball, the National Basketball Association, the NCAA and the National Hockey League.CNN would also give Discovery a foothold into news, and Zaslav and CNN’s president, Jeff Zucker, are longtime golfing buddies.By Edmund Lee and John Koblinc.2021 The New York Times Company",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/trends/att-discovery-deal-would-create-a-media-juggernaut-6901731.html,Research,"Malone began his career at the Bell Labs division of AT&T before going on to become one of the biggest cable entrepreneurs in the country.The deal could also benefit Advance Publications, the publisher of Condé Nast, as Discovery’s biggest shareholder.The new company would create a new kind of media behemoth, one that is still living off the fat profits of old-school cable, while spending those profits (and more) on streaming.Even with increased competition, HBO remains a standout in television, and last year, once again, captured more Emmys than any other network, studio or platform, including Netflix.It has several hit shows, including “Succession,” “Curb Your Enthusiasm,” “Barry” and “Last Week Tonight With John Oliver.” It also has a huge library that includes “The Sopranos,” “Game of Thrones” and “Sex and the City.”The Warner Bros.

Scientists discover rare solar system with planets rotating in opposite direction of star,17 February,"Scientists have discovered a planetary system that has questioned mankind’s understanding of the universe. In the newly found solar system, two planets orbit in the opposite direction of the star.Unlike in our solar system, where the sun and the planets all rotate in the same direction, the system works in reverse in this newly discovered solar system. Scientists believe this happens because of the presence of a second star in the vicinity of the planetary system.The unique solar system was discovered by a team of researchers led by Maria Hjorth and Simon Albrecht from the Stellar Astrophysics Centre, Aarhus University, Denmark. Their findings were published in the science journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.The paper titled A backward-spinning star with two coplanar planets states that the two planets orbit in a direction nearly opposite to that of the star’s rotation around its own axis.This is not the first time scientists have chanced upon such a unique system in the universe. Similar discoveries were made in the past too, but scientists were unable to explain what caused it.A report by Phys Org quoted Princeton University’s Joshua Winn as saying: “This is not the first known case of a ‘backwards’ planetary system—the first ones were sighted more than 10 years ago. But this is a rare case in which we think we know what caused the drastic misalignment, and the explanation is different from what researchers have assumed might have happened in the other systems.”However, in case of the K2-290 system, scientists could point out at a possible causal phenomenon.The study read: “Here, we show that the star K2-290 A is tilted by 124 ± 6 degrees compared to the orbits of both of its known planets and has a wide-orbiting stellar companion that is capable of having tilted the protoplanetary disk.”Rebekah Dawson, the co-author of the study explained: “In any planetary system, the planets are thought to form in a spinning, circular disk of material that swirls around a young star for a few million years after the star itself is born, the so-called protoplanetary disk. Usually, the disk and the star are spinning the same way. However, if there is a neighbouring star, the gravitational force from the neighboring star might tilt the disk.”This means, in the K2-290 system, the planets are being pulled by the gravitational force of another star.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/science/scientists-discover-rare-solar-system-with-planets-rotating-in-opposite-direction-of-star-6535081.html,Research,"In the newly found solar system, two planets orbit in the opposite direction of the star.Unlike in our solar system, where the sun and the planets all rotate in the same direction, the system works in reverse in this newly discovered solar system.But this is a rare case in which we think we know what caused the drastic misalignment, and the explanation is different from what researchers have assumed might have happened in the other systems.”However, in case of the K2-290 system, scientists could point out at a possible causal phenomenon.The study read: “Here, we show that the star K2-290 A is tilted by 124 ± 6 degrees compared to the orbits of both of its known planets and has a wide-orbiting stellar companion that is capable of having tilted the protoplanetary disk.”Rebekah Dawson, the co-author of the study explained: “In any planetary system, the planets are thought to form in a spinning, circular disk of material that swirls around a young star for a few million years after the star itself is born, the so-called protoplanetary disk.",[],[]
Australian scientists discover ‘glowing balls’ in space,10 July,"Australian scientists have found some never-see-before objects in space, tentatively titled ‘odd radio circles’ (ORCs), reported Times Now .There is still an incredibly-large domain of space yet to be discovered, which is why scientists are always on the prowl looking for the next big thing that could give them clues that reveal what exists in deep space.Taking this never-ending journey of discovery in the realm of space forward is this group of scientists from Western Sydney University led by Ray Norris, who has uncovered a unique class of space objects that have never been seen before.Using a radio telescope array located in the Australian midwest, known as the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder telescope, this team identified four objects, with three of them being circular objects with a brightly lit circle around them.The researchers are calling the objects ‘glowing balls’.They first encountered them while surveying the night sky, according to a New York Post report. Explaining that one unknown object can be considered a glitch, but three or more of them may suggest a pattern, which is what prompted the confirmation. The researchers are currently working on finding the origin of these objects.Circles can represent multiple things, including everything from leftovers of a supernova to a planetary nebula, according to this report in the Independent. ""We have found an unexpected class of astronomical objects which have not previously been reported, in the Evolutionary Map of the Universe Pilot survey, using the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder telescope.

Scientists discover new mineral that has never been found in nature before,27 December,"A new mineral named Edscottite has become the cause of celebration in the scientific community. Found lying unnoticed by the road of an Australian town, the unforeseen nugget took a while before it became the object of attention.The Wedderburn meteorite as it is also referred to had been lying in Australia since 1951. The small odd-looking space rock that barely weighs a little above 200 grams, is being studied for decades, but its most striking property wasn’t discovered until now.Technically, Edscottite is just a phase that iron goes through while cooling down on its way to getting smelted into steel. But this Edscottite is extraordinary by virtue of its origin. Instead of being a phase in a man-made process, this one was formed naturally.Scientists analysed it and confirmed it to be a natural occurrence of the iron-carbide mineral a few months ago, reported CNN.Only a part of the black and red space rock can still be found shelved with other geological finds at Museums Victoria in Australia. The rest was used up while conducting multiple scientific pieces of research on its properties aiming to ascertain its peculiarities. In the process, traces of gold and iron have also been found in the meteorite, along with other minerals like kamacite, taenite, troilite, and schreibersite – all of which are rare finds.The discovery of this mineral is crucial as it wasn’t known to mankind until now that this form of iron carbide mineral can occur in nature. The synthetic version of it has existed for ages, however.Thanks to this discovery, now Edscottite has also been officially recognised by the International Mineralogical Association (IMA).One must note here, there is yet no certainty over how this sliver of natural Edscottite wound up on rural Wedderburn. Some scientists believe it to have formed inside the immensely pressurised and heated core of an ancient planet that may have blasted apart due to a massive cosmic collision.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/trends/scientists-discover-new-mineral-that-has-never-been-found-in-nature-before-4766671.html,Research,"Instead of being a phase in a man-made process, this one was formed naturally.Scientists analysed it and confirmed it to be a natural occurrence of the iron-carbide mineral a few months ago, reported CNN.Only a part of the black and red space rock can still be found shelved with other geological finds at Museums Victoria in Australia.In the process, traces of gold and iron have also been found in the meteorite, along with other minerals like kamacite, taenite, troilite, and schreibersite – all of which are rare finds.The discovery of this mineral is crucial as it wasn’t known to mankind until now that this form of iron carbide mineral can occur in nature.",[],[]
Saturn found to have more Moons than Jupiter and you have a chance to name them,10 October,"American scientist Scott Sheppard announced this week that his team at the Carnegie Institution of Science have discovered 20 new natural satellites of the Saturn. The team, which also included David Jewitt of the University of California and Jan Kleyna of the University of Hawaii, used Subaru telescope atop Mauna Kea in Hawaii to make this discovery.Their findings have earned Saturn the top spot among planets in this solar system, for having the maximum number of moons. It was confirmed by the International Astronomical Union's Minor Planet Centre, said a report by The Weather Channel.Earlier, it was believed that Jupiter has the maximum number of permanent natural satellites. As of now, Saturn has 82 moons around it, while Jupiter has only 79. It probably took the scientific community so long to discover the twenty-odd moons circling Saturn is because of the great distance of the planet from the Earth.Scientists are now claiming to have finally completed preparing the list of satellites as small as 5-km diameter around Saturn and 1.6 km around Jupiter. These small satellites are believed to be born out of bigger moons while the Saturn was taking shape.Studying the formation of these tiny moons may reportedly enhance our understanding of the formation of the solar system. Astronomer Sheppard said: “Studying the orbits of these moons can reveal their origins, as well as information about the conditions surrounding Saturn at the time of its formation.”Also, interestingly, only three of the new moons orbit Saturn in the same direction as it spins, the rest are retrograde and spin in the opposite direction.After making this discovery, the institute promptly threw open a contest to name the twenty new-found celestial bodies. People from all over the world can be a part of this naming contest that was thrown open on October 7 and will go on till December 6.Anybody who wishes to participate in the process will have to tweet the suggestions to @SaturnLunacy, explaining why they want to go with that particular name. The hashtag to be used for all such posts is #NameSaturnMoons.Team led by @CarnegiePlanets' Scott Sheppard has found 20 new moons orbiting Saturn, bringing its total number to 82, surpassing Jupiter. These moons can reveal their origins and the conditions surrounding Saturn during its formation. https://t.co/QvzV1oA4aF pic.twitter.com/x0PV9rkzKD— Carnegie Science (@carnegiescience) October 7, 2019However, one must remember, two of these moons ought to be named after characters of the Inuit mythology, given they belong to the Inuit group. The other 17 moons must be named after giants from Norse mythology, while one ought to be named after a giant from the Gallic mythology.Notably, a similar such contest was held earlier this year, between the months of February and April, to name the 12 new moons of Jupiter that had been discovered.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/trends/saturn-found-to-have-more-moons-than-jupiter-and-you-have-a-chance-to-name-them-4518671.html,Research,"It probably took the scientific community so long to discover the twenty-odd moons circling Saturn is because of the great distance of the planet from the Earth.Scientists are now claiming to have finally completed preparing the list of satellites as small as 5-km diameter around Saturn and 1.6 km around Jupiter.Astronomer Sheppard said: “Studying the orbits of these moons can reveal their origins, as well as information about the conditions surrounding Saturn at the time of its formation.”Also, interestingly, only three of the new moons orbit Saturn in the same direction as it spins, the rest are retrograde and spin in the opposite direction.After making this discovery, the institute promptly threw open a contest to name the twenty new-found celestial bodies.",[],['#NameSaturnMoons']

Loss hit investors in Adani Ent shares complain to Sebi,04 June,"Moneycontrol BureauThe Investors Grievances Forum (IGF) has complained to Sebi that many investors in Adani Enterprises suffered losses on Wednesday because of stock exchanges not following the normal practice for trading in shares after a demerger of business.Adani Enterprises opened at Rs 574 on Wednesday and then plunged over 80 percent percent  as the stock price adjusted for demerger of its port, power and transmission businesses. Investors who were unaware of demerger becoming effective bought the shares at higher levels and lost money when the price crashed, IGF wrote to Sebi.“As a normal practice and considering the interest of investors, the shares of Adani Enterprises should have been allowed for trading at an adjusted price considering the hiving off its businesses into separate companies or there should have been special session for discovery of price of the shares of Adani Enterprises as it was done in the past for the shares of Reliance Industries,” the IGF letter to Sebi said. Following is the full text of the letter:Dear Sir, Sub: Trading in demerged shares of ADANI ENTERPRISE (Scrip Code 512599) without adjustment of price or calling for special session for proper discovery of price.Investors Grievances Forum (IGF) has been taking up issues concerning investors with SEBI and other authorities so as to protect the interest of investors. The IGF is at pain to bring to your notice about the gross irregularities (which appears to be deliberate and mala fide) seen in the trading of demerged shares of Adani Enterprises.Today i.e. on June 03, 2015, the shares of Adani Enterprises were listed for trading after the implementation of composite scheme of arrangement and demerger. Hence, the listing of Adani Enterprises today is as a demerged company having hived off its port, power, power transmission businesses into separate companies. As a normal practice and considering the interest of investors, the shares of Adani Enterprises should have been allowed for trading at an adjusted price considering the hiving off its businesses into separate companies or there should have been special session for discovery of price of the shares of Adani Enterprises as it was done in the past for the shares of Reliance Industries.However, today as a sudden shock and surprise to investors as well as to IGF, the shares of Adani Enterprises were allowed to be traded without any adjustment of price of shares or without calling for special session for proper discovery of share prices. According to the sources having expertise in the valuation of shares, the fair value of shares of Adani Enterprises is not more than Rs.120/= and as such the trading in the shares of Adani Enterprises should not have been allowed at the maximum of Rs.120/= per shares or special session should have been called for the purpose of determining fair value of shares through the price discovery mechanism.However, by brushing aside and throwing all the norms which should have been observed by the Stock Exchanges, the shares of Adani Enterpirses were allowed to be traded by the Stock Exchanges in a most shocking manner. The shares of the Adani Enterprises opened at whopping high of Rs.537/=, touched a drastic low of Rs.116/= and currently trading at around Rs.120/=. It is pertinent to mention that the large number of gullible innocent investors (being not aware of adjusted share prices after demerger or having no knowledge of the cunning way in which Exchanges allowed trading of share of Adani Enterprises) who have bought shares at the higher prices have been trapped resulting into losses to them. The IGF is of the considered view that the Exchanges should have held special session for discovery of shares prices of Adani Enterprises or should have sought proper valuation of shares for adjusting the share prices.Needless to mention that the SEBI is having primary duty to protect the interest of investors, hence, it is necessary that a thorough investigation is carried out to examine the role of the Exchanges in allowing shares to be traded with such a high and vide trading price zones. We apprehend that the vested interests in Exchanges with connivance of manipulators allowed trading in Adani Enterprises in such a high and vide trading price zone with mala fide intentions to cause loss to large number of investors. The IGF feels that the manner in which trading took place in Adani Enterprises, addition of scrips in F&O, changes in Nifty components etc., the state of affairs at the Exchanges needs to be examined so as to avoid the possibility of instutionalised scams orchestrated and executed by the unethical highly qualified professionals.Therefore, IGF demands a time bound investigations into the above so as to ensure that the sanctity of the trading platform is always maintained and investors are not put to any loss by discriminatory treatments. This is necessary to maintain the confidence of investors into the regulatory systems and also to stop further desertion of investors from stock market.Immediate action by SEBI shall be highly appreciated.Thanking you,Yours truly,For INVESTORS GRIEVANCES FORUMSANDEEP SHAHMEMBER – CORE COMMITTEE",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/loss-hit-investorsadani-ent-shares-complain-to-sebi-1556317.html,Research,"As a normal practice and considering the interest of investors, the shares of Adani Enterprises should have been allowed for trading at an adjusted price considering the hiving off its businesses into separate companies or there should have been special session for discovery of price of the shares of Adani Enterprises as it was done in the past for the shares of Reliance Industries.However, today as a sudden shock and surprise to investors as well as to IGF, the shares of Adani Enterprises were allowed to be traded without any adjustment of price of shares or without calling for special session for proper discovery of share prices.According to the sources having expertise in the valuation of shares, the fair value of shares of Adani Enterprises is not more than Rs.120/= and as such the trading in the shares of Adani Enterprises should not have been allowed at the maximum of Rs.120/= per shares or special session should have been called for the purpose of determining fair value of shares through the price discovery mechanism.However, by brushing aside and throwing all the norms which should have been observed by the Stock Exchanges, the shares of Adani Enterpirses were allowed to be traded by the Stock Exchanges in a most shocking manner.","['Adani Enterprises', 'Adani Enterprises', 'Reliance Industries', 'Adani Enterprises', 'Adani Enterprises', 'Adani Enterprises', 'Adani Enterpirses']",[]

As this report highlights, the initial opportunities arise as founders onboard the early team to help establish the business. A multiplier impact on job creation is seen in the growth and expansion stage when operations expand, and various initiatives mature. The dynamic working environment in startups provides the ideal training ground for aspiring entrepreneurs who then move on to create their own startups,” said Rohit Bansal, chairman of FICCI Startup Committee.

88% Indians would trade high-paying jobs for mental wellbeing: Survey,11 March,"A majority of Indians would rather take a lower-paying job if it meant less stress and better mental health, a survey conducted by UKG has found. UKG, a US-based workforce management firm, found that 88% of employees in India would give up their high-paying jobs for mental wellbeing, as compared to 70% employees in the US.The Financial Express reported these findings earlier this week, noting that long hours spent in office is the primary cause for work-related stress.33% Indian employees said that working long hours is the primary trigger for stress, which in turn affects their professional performance. 34% said they experience decreased concentration, while 31% are unable to build healthy relationships with colleagues.

"Electronics industry on song, says survey",31 January,"The PLI (production-linked incentive) scheme seems to have done well for the electronics industry.As of FY20 the domestic electronics industry was valued at $118 billion. India aims to grow this to a  $300 billion industry, including $120 billion in exports, by FY26. This is in line with the grand vision of becoming a $1 trillion digital economy by 2025.Electronics exports were among the top five sectors that demonstrated strong growth in November 2022, expanding 55.1 percent year-on-year (YoY).Key driversMobile phones, consumer electronics, and industrial electronics are key drivers for the growth of this sector. In the mobile phone segment, India has become the second-largest mobile phone manufacturer globally, with the production of handsets going up from six crore units in FY15 to 31 crore units in FY22. The numbers are expected to improve as more domestic and global players set up shop and expand their bases in India.According to the latest economic survey, “Two major global and domestic players in electronic manufacturing services have already embraced the PLI scheme. Israel-based International Semiconductor Consortium has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to invest ₹22,900 crore in Karnataka to set up India’s first chip-making plant. Domestic players such as Vedanta and Tata have also indicated plans to establish semiconductor fabs in the country. The scheme will help many more domestic players attain economies of scale in production through localising. Consequently, this will further enhance export competitiveness and increase India’s participation in the global value chain.”Among the initiatives and incentives provided by the government for the electronics industry are:PLI scheme for large scale electronics manufacturingPLI scheme for IT hardwareScheme for the Promotion of Manufacturing of Electronic Components and Semiconductors (SPECS)Programme for development of semiconductors and the display manufacturing ecosystem",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/budget/electronics-industry-on-song-says-survey-9973491.html,Research,"The numbers are expected to improve as more domestic and global players set up shop and expand their bases in India.According to the latest economic survey, “Two major global and domestic players in electronic manufacturing services have already embraced the PLI scheme.Consequently, this will further enhance export competitiveness and increase India’s participation in the global value chain.”Among the initiatives and incentives provided by the government for the electronics industry are:PLI scheme for large scale electronics manufacturingPLI scheme for IT hardwareScheme for the Promotion of Manufacturing of Electronic Components and Semiconductors (SPECS)Programme for development of semiconductors and the display manufacturing ecosystem",['the Promotion of Manufacturing of Electronic Components and Semiconductors'],"['$118 billion', 'a \xa0$300 billion', '$120 billion', '$1 trillion']"
"Govt steps moderated pandemic impact on small businesses, says Survey",31 January,"Small businesses in India have recovered from the Covid-19-induced shock, as was evident in their payment of goods and services tax, which crossed the pre-pandemic level in FY22, according to the Economic Survey for FY23.Credit to micro, small and medium enterprises increased significantly, in part assisted by the Emergency Credit Linked Guarantee Scheme (ECLGS).“Growth in credit to MSME was buttressed by rebounding consumption levels, particularly in the services sector. Consequently, the share of MSMEs in gross credit offtake to the industry rose from 17.7 per cent in January 2020 to 23.7 per cent in November 2022,” the Survey said.Additionally, there was a bouquet of measures introduced by the government to boost MSMEs.The Centre introduced several measures as part of its Aatmanirbhar Bharat Package to moderate the impact of the pandemic effect on the MSME sector, including modification of the definition of MSMEs, a provision of Rs 20,000 crore subordinate debt for stressed MSMEs, Rs 50,000 crore equity infusion through Self-Reliant India Fund, waiving of the global tender requirement for procurement of up to Rs 200 crore, and the launch of the Udyam portal for MSME registration, a paperless, zero-cost registration portal that is based on self-declaration and only requires Aadhaar.Registrations on the Udyam portal crossed the 10 million mark in August 2022, surpassing the total registration of the past 14 years under the old regime in just 2.5 years.Enterprises registered on the portal employ 96 million people, of which 23 million are women. There are 150,000 exporting units, which have contributed a cumulative Rs 9.7 lakh crore worth of shipments.Cashflow problemsThe Samadhaan portal, set up under the Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises Development (MSMED) Act to monitor outstanding dues to the sector, is helping to resolve their cashflow difficulties.“As of January 7, 2022, the portal has received 1.3 lakh applications, of which 16.8 percent have been disposed of, 25 percent are under consideration, and 25.1 per cent have been rejected. In order to fast-track this process, the government has instructed central public sector enterprises and all companies with a turnover of Rs 200 crore or more to get themselves onboarded on the Trade Receivables Discounting System (TReDS) platform for facilitating the discounting of trade receivables of MSMEs through multiple financiers,” the Survey pointed out.The government also started the Raising and Accelerating MSME Performance Scheme (RAMP), according to the Survey, which was intended to strengthen institutions and governance at the Centre and states. A World Bank-supported scheme, it is proposed to be implemented over a period of five years.The total outlay for the scheme is Rs 6,062.4 crore, of which Rs 3,750 crore would be a loan from the World Bank and the government would fund the remaining Rs 2,312.4 crore.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/govt-steps-moderated-pandemic-impact-on-small-businesses-says-survey-9973321.html,Research,"Consequently, the share of MSMEs in gross credit offtake to the industry rose from 17.7 per cent in January 2020 to 23.7 per cent in November 2022,” the Survey said.Additionally, there was a bouquet of measures introduced by the government to boost MSMEs.The Centre introduced several measures as part of its Aatmanirbhar Bharat Package to moderate the impact of the pandemic effect on the MSME sector, including modification of the definition of MSMEs, a provision of Rs 20,000 crore subordinate debt for stressed MSMEs, Rs 50,000 crore equity infusion through Self-Reliant India Fund, waiving of the global tender requirement for procurement of up to Rs 200 crore, and the launch of the Udyam portal for MSME registration, a paperless, zero-cost registration portal that is based on self-declaration and only requires Aadhaar.Registrations on the Udyam portal crossed the 10 million mark in August 2022, surpassing the total registration of the past 14 years under the old regime in just 2.5 years.Enterprises registered on the portal employ 96 million people, of which 23 million are women.In order to fast-track this process, the government has instructed central public sector enterprises and all companies with a turnover of Rs 200 crore or more to get themselves onboarded on the Trade Receivables Discounting System (TReDS) platform for facilitating the discounting of trade receivables of MSMEs through multiple financiers,” the Survey pointed out.The government also started the Raising and Accelerating MSME Performance Scheme (RAMP), according to the Survey, which was intended to strengthen institutions and governance at the Centre and states.","['Centre', 'MSME', 'Self-Reliant India Fund', 'Aadhaar', 'Udyam', 'the Trade Receivables Discounting System']","['17.7 per cent', '23.7 per cent', '25.1 per cent']"
Export outlook may remain flat in coming year if global growth does not pick up: Survey,31 January,"India's export growth is likely to be flat in the next fiscal if the global economy does not pick up, the Economic Survey said on Tuesday.The Survey said that though India's merchandise exports have touched an all-time high of USD 422 billion in 2021-22, the world economy has started facing formidable headwinds and the ripple effect of the global trade slowdown has started reflecting in India's goods export growth.India's exports contracted by 12.2 per cent to USD 34.48 billion in December 2022 due to the global demand slowdown, and the trade deficit widened to USD 23.76 billion during the same period, according to government data.During April-December this fiscal, the country's overall exports rose 9 per cent to USD 332.76 billion while imports increased 24.96 per cent to USD 551.7 billion.The trade deficit during April-December 2022 period widened to USD 218.94 billion as against USD 136.45 billion in April-December 2021.""The export outlook may remain flat in the coming year if global growth does not pick up in 2023, as indicated by many forecasts,"" the survey said.In such cases, it said, diversification in export destinations and the product basket through free trade agreements (FTAs) would be useful to enhance trade opportunities.At times when the base (global growth and global trade) is not growing, export growth will have to come predominantly through market share gains, it noted.""In turn, that comes from the focus on efficiency, productivity, technology, and innovation. That game has to be lifted. Governments can try and open markets through FTAs. But, to take advantage of that is in the hands of private sector participants,"" it added.The World Trade Organisation (WTO) has projected a growth of only 1 per cent in global trade in 2023.In December 2022, key export sector have recorded negative growth and that include engineering goods, gems and jewellery, leather goods, pharma, carpet, and petroleum products.""The slowdown in Indian exports is inevitable in a slowing global economy, characterised by slowing global trade,"" it said.India's external sector has been impacted due to volatility in global commodity prices; tightening international financial conditions; heightening financial market volatility; reversal of capital flows; currency depreciation, and looming global growth and trade slowdown.""However, it has been able to face these headwinds from a position of strength on the back of strong macroeconomic fundamentals and buffers,"" it added.The government is expecting that measures like announcement of National Logistics Policy, and recently implemented FTAs (UAE and Australia) would address the external frictions by creating opportunities for exports.""Thus, the whole ecosystem would evolve in an export-friendly manner over time,"" the survey said adding the risk of supply chain shocks has never been more palpable than today, following compounding crises from the US-China trade war, the Covid-19 pandemic, and the war in Ukraine.In this fast-evolving context, as global companies adapt their manufacturing and supply chain strategies to build resilience, India has a unique opportunity to become a global manufacturing hub this decade, it said.The three primary assets to capitalise on this unique opportunity are the potential for significant domestic demand, the government's drive to encourage manufacturing, and a distinct demographic edge, including a considerable proportion of the young workforce, the survey suggested.It said that the FTAs would help provide greater market access with a reduction in tariff (customs duties) and non-tariff barriers on goods and services and make the exporters competitive.Recognising that FTAs would continue to feature permanently in world trade, India has engaged with its trading partners/blocs with the intention of expanding its export market.""The economic rationale for FTAs was the diversification and expansion of India's exports to its trading partners, providing a level playing field vis-à-vis the competing countries having preferential access in our trading partners, as well as gain easier access to raw materials and intermediate products, at lower costs, for stimulating value-added domestic manufacturing,"" it said.India has so far concluded 13 FTAs and six preferential trade agreements. The country is presently engaged in negotiations with the UK, Canada, and European Union.The limited progress in the multilateral trade negotiations at the WTO is one of the reasons responsible for the increase in FTAs.

"Investors hoard dollars on a bleak outlook, shows Bank of America survey",14 September,"To rephrase Oscar Wilde’s words, everyone is in the gutter and no one is looking at the stars.Global fund managers have only turned more bearish on global growth and expect the US Federal Reserve to raise the Fed funds rate by 200 basis points more, disregarding recessionary forces at work in the country. One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.A survey of fund managers by Bank of America shows that cash levels have risen to the highest since the terror attacks on the twin towers in September 2001, more than two decades ago. More than half the fund managers surveyed said they were underweight on equities and overweight on cash in the latest survey.Cash levels are now at 6.1 percent and the most extended fund managers’ position is long on the US dollar; a similar extent was seen in US tech companies in November 2020.In other words, investors are choosing the dollar over every other asset to buy. This is also evident from the fact that the dollar index is testing fresh multi-decadal highs after the August retail inflation rate came in more than expected at 8.3 percent.“A net 92 percent of FMS (fund managers’ survey) investors see profits declining in the next year, suggesting further deterioration ahead in the manufacturing PMI (Purchasing Managers Index) survey,” Bank of America said in a statement.Also read: Stock market crashes as inflation spooks investors. Factors dragging equities lowerRecession worriesExpectations of a recession are very close to the highs seen when the coronavirus pandemic broke two years ago.

"Confidence level among students of CBSE, ICSE marginally higher than those of state boards: Survey",08 September,"Confidence level among students studying in CBSE and ICSE schools is marginally higher than those enrolled under state boards, a new survey has claimed.The survey was conducted by the Tata Institute of Social Sciences (TISS) and edtech company LEAD. A total of 2,807 students were surveyed in six metro cities and as many non-metro cities spread across the four major regions of India.”Thirty-six per cent of students have indicated top-bracket confidence levels (81-100),” the survey claimed, adding that students studying in CBSE and ICSE schools have marginally higher confidence than state board students.”However, in Delhi, the confidence index is marginally higher for state board students,” it further said. The results have been divided into four categories: Aspirant, Leader, All-rounder and Influencer.”At an all-India level, one in every two respondent students is in the all-rounder segment, with a little over one-third of students finding space in the influencer segment. Interestingly, the trend is similar in metro and non-metro cities, although the size of the influencer segment in metros (44 pc) is significantly higher when compared to non-metro students (28 pc),” it said.The survey took into account five factors that contribute to confidence-building in students conceptual understanding, critical thinking, communication, collaboration and exposure to opportunities.”The study captures students’ ratings on 20 statements that focus on activities done in schools. Activities were rotated and each statement was given equal weightage to eliminate order bias,” the report said.”Self-confidence in children has never been more important. It is the foundation of all success and achievement in life. It also impacts academic motivation and educational outcomes,” it added.In terms of region-wise comparison, west India (81) has topped the confidence index, while the south (75) and the east (74) regions hover near the national average and the north (70) region comes last, the survey said.Hyderabad has emerged as the top city in terms of confidence index with 87 per cent, followed by Delhi at 80, Mumbai and Kolkata at 78, Bengaluru at 75 and Chennai at 71, it added.”It was also observed that the confidence index of students in classes 9 and 10 (75 per cent) is only slightly higher when compared to students in classes 6-8 (74 per cent),” the report claimed.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/india/confidence-level-among-students-of-cbse-icse-marginally-higher-than-those-of-state-boards-survey-9149771.html,Research,"A total of 2,807 students were surveyed in six metro cities and as many non-metro cities spread across the four major regions of India.”Thirty-six per cent of students have indicated top-bracket confidence levels (81-100),” the survey claimed, adding that students studying in CBSE and ICSE schools have marginally higher confidence than state board students.”However, in Delhi, the confidence index is marginally higher for state board students,” it further said.It also impacts academic motivation and educational outcomes,” it added.In terms of region-wise comparison, west India (81) has topped the confidence index, while the south (75) and the east (74) regions hover near the national average and the north (70) region comes last, the survey said.Hyderabad has emerged as the top city in terms of confidence index with 87 per cent, followed by Delhi at 80, Mumbai and Kolkata at 78, Bengaluru at 75 and Chennai at 71, it added.”It was also observed that the confidence index of students in classes 9 and 10 (75 per cent) is only slightly higher when compared to students in classes 6-8 (74 per cent),” the report claimed.","['CBSE', 'ICSE', 'Bengaluru', 'Chennai']","['87 per cent', '74 per cent']"
"66% Mumbaikars, 78% Puneris support Maharashtra’s latest EV policy: Survey",05 September,"A recent survey has found that 66 percent Mumbaikars and 78 percent Puneris ""strongly support"" the latest electric vehicle (EV) policy of Maharashtra that requires time-bound transition plans from delivery companies vis-à-vis last-mile delivery. The respondents also indicated a strong preference to prioritise purchases from progressive companies that are in line with and make commitments to the state government targets to rapidly decarbonise their fleets.Under the nationwide survey that was conducted across six cities, 1,508 consumers were questioned from Pune and Mumbai each. The other cities that were surveyed for the consumer study titled ‘Delivery Fleets & EV Transition in Key Indian Cities’ are Delhi, Kolkata, Bengaluru, and Chennai.As many as 83 percent of the respondents from Mumbai attributed last-mile delivery vehicles as one of the reasons for rising air pollution in the cities, with 88.7 percent affirming a switch to EV vehicles by the delivery companies as important to addressing air pollution issues and mitigating climate change. In Pune, 84.5 percent respondents attributed last-mile delivery vehicles as one of the reasons for rising air pollution in the cities, with 97.2 percent affirming a switch to EV vehicles by the delivery companies as important to addressing air pollution issues and mitigating climate change.Notably, the Maharashtra government, as part of its overall EV policy, has set a 25 percent target for EV vehicles among e-commerce, delivery and logistics service providers in the state by 2025.Commenting on the findings of the survey, Bhagwan Keshbhat, CEO of Waatavaran Foundation, said: “The findings indicate strong support for the policy direction on delivery sector emissions in Maharashtra. Along with the central government Niti Aayog’s Shoonya campaign, which actively looks to decarbonize the last mile delivery sector, delivery companies should come forward to work closely with our government to ensure rapid transition of their fleets.”Respondents nationwide stressed on the need for a socially just transition of their delivery fleets by companies with 38 percent stressing that companies should either lease or purchase electric vehicles for their delivery partners/workers, 31 percent saying companies should provide financial incentives to delivery partners for buying electric vehicles and another 19 percent stating that support should be provided to the delivery partners to retrofit their existing delivery vehicles.Atul Mudaliar, Head of Business Initiatives, Climate Group India, said: “It is time that all e-commerce and food companies find cleaner ways to deliver goods. The survey clearly shows that two out of three consumers acknowledge that the goods they purchase add to air pollution and are responsible for climate change in some way. Consumers believe that companies can do more by proactively switching over to electric vehicles for delivery.”Mudaliar added: “While prominent companies like Flipkart and Zomato have announced a massive shift to 100 percent electric vehicles by 2030 in line with EV100, state policies in India have now started introducing mandates. Soon, delivery companies will have no choice but to change.”",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/city-business/66-mumbaikars-78-puneris-support-maharashtras-latest-ev-policy-survey-9134861.html,Research,"In Pune, 84.5 percent respondents attributed last-mile delivery vehicles as one of the reasons for rising air pollution in the cities, with 97.2 percent affirming a switch to EV vehicles by the delivery companies as important to addressing air pollution issues and mitigating climate change.Notably, the Maharashtra government, as part of its overall EV policy, has set a 25 percent target for EV vehicles among e-commerce, delivery and logistics service providers in the state by 2025.Commenting on the findings of the survey, Bhagwan Keshbhat, CEO of Waatavaran Foundation, said: “The findings indicate strong support for the policy direction on delivery sector emissions in Maharashtra.Along with the central government Niti Aayog’s Shoonya campaign, which actively looks to decarbonize the last mile delivery sector, delivery companies should come forward to work closely with our government to ensure rapid transition of their fleets.”Respondents nationwide stressed on the need for a socially just transition of their delivery fleets by companies with 38 percent stressing that companies should either lease or purchase electric vehicles for their delivery partners/workers, 31 percent saying companies should provide financial incentives to delivery partners for buying electric vehicles and another 19 percent stating that support should be provided to the delivery partners to retrofit their existing delivery vehicles.Atul Mudaliar, Head of Business Initiatives, Climate Group India, said: “It is time that all e-commerce and food companies find cleaner ways to deliver goods.","['EV', 'EV', 'EV', 'Waatavaran Foundation', 'Niti Aayog’s', 'Business Initiatives', 'Climate Group India']",[]

3 out of 4 fliers on domestic routes worried about flight safety: Moneycontrol-LocalCircles poll,08 July,"About three out of every four Indians travelling on domestic flights are worried about air safety following a number of incidents over the last few months, reflects a survey by Moneycontrol and LocalCircles.The poll was conducted on July 6 and 7, within days of three aircraft belonging to IndiGo, Vistara and SpiceJet reported smoke or engine-shut issues or technical malfunction during their flight. About 21,000 people participated in the poll.Only 16 percent of fliers said they were not concerned at all about flight safety. While 42 percent said that they were concerned while travelling by a domestic airline in general, 35 percent said they were only concerned if they were travelling on a select few airlines.Financial crunch leading to poor maintenanceCOVID-19 VaccineFrequently Asked QuestionsA vaccine works by mimicking a natural infection. A vaccine not only induces immune response to protect people from any future COVID-19 infection, but also helps quickly build herd immunity to put an end to the pandemic. Herd immunity occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population becomes immune to a disease, making the spread of disease from person to person unlikely. The good news is that SARS-CoV-2 virus has been fairly stable, which increases the viability of a vaccine.There are broadly four types of vaccine — one, a vaccine based on the whole virus (this could be either inactivated, or an attenuated [weakened] virus vaccine); two, a non-replicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of SARS-CoV; three, nucleic-acid vaccines that have genetic material like DNA and RNA of antigens like spike protein given to a person, helping  human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine; and four, protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombinant proteins of SARS-COV-2 along with an adjuvant (booster) is given as a vaccine.Vaccine development is a long, complex process. Unlike drugs that are given to people with a diseased, vaccines are given to healthy people and also vulnerable sections such as children, pregnant women and the elderly. So rigorous tests are compulsory. History says that the fastest time it took to develop a vaccine is five years, but it usually takes double or sometimes triple that time.Nearly half the respondents to the survey said that the rising airline safety incidents were due to the financial crunch being faced by some of the airlines leading to inadequate maintenance. After two years of the pandemic and subsequent lockdowns hit the aviation industry hard, carriers are now facing rising operating costs owing to inflation, especially in the price of crude oil.Around 18 percent of Indians blamed the aviation regulator Directorate General of Civil Aviation for “ineffective oversight”. Five percent of the respondents said it was due to the lack of technical knowhow at some airlines, while 10 percent attributed it to poor management of assets and resources, the survey found. Around 15 percent of the respondents said that weak internal and/or external safety audit systems have been the major cause of rising airline safety incidents.The survey's finding come just after the DGCA slapped a show-cause notice on SpiceJet after eight incidents involving the airline have surfaced in the past 20 days. The aviation watchdog had last month also suspended two certified flying instructors for one year.Fliers avoid specific airlinesFliers were also asked if they were avoiding any particular airlines due to safety concerns. In this particular question, respondents were given the option of selecting one of more airlines if they were avoiding them when making a booking.Around 44 percent of the respondents to the LocalCircles survey traveling on domestic routes said that they were avoiding SpiceJet flights over safety concerns.Another 21 percent each said that they were avoiding travel on Air India and Indigo, while 18 percent said that they were avoiding traveling by GoFirst.Six percent of respondents said they have been avoiding travel on Vistara and some 12 percent said they give Air Asia a pass. This question in the survey received 16,128 responses.Moneycontrol has reached out to Indigo, Air India and GoFirst for comment. This story will be updated as and when we receive their responses.SpiceJet in a response to queries sent by Moneycontrol said that the airline has reported the highest load factor in the industry for more than 30 consecutive months, which shows that the airline is the most preferred and trusted airline in the country.The budget carrier also said that its flights were absolutely safe and that the safety of its passengers, crew and aircraft is paramount to them.""The DGCA had only last month audited all our aircraft and found them to be absolutely safe,"" a SpiceJet spokesperson said.Overall, the three poll questions received 45,000 responses from citizens residing in 302 districts of India.

"Ecommerce platforms should publish negative ratings, restrict low-rated products from re-listing: Survey ",04 July,"About 58 percent of consumers in a survey said their negative ratings and reviews were not published by e-commerce platforms. Ninety percent of the respondents argued such platforms should restrict low-rated products by sellers from re-listing as another product, according to a survey conducted by community social media platform LocalCircles.The survey results come at the back of the government’s announcement to develop a framework for keeping a check on fake reviews posted on e-commerce websites in a bid to protect consumer interest.The consumer affairs ministry along with the Advertising Standards Council of India (ASCI) held a virtual meeting on May 27 with stakeholders, including e-commerce entities, to discuss the magnitude of fake reviews on their platforms, before making the announcement.In the survey, 90 percent of consumers who shop on e-commerce platforms responded negatively when asked if a product with a large number of low ratings and negative reviews, should be allowed to re-list without a review of the issues.Only 2 percent said “Yes, they should be permitted to create a new listing of the product if they choose to” and 8 percent did not have an opinion. The question received 11,624 responses.LocalCircles conducted the national study to understand consumers’ experience with reviews and ratings on e-commerce sites.

Fewer women decide by themselves how to spend their incomes: National survey,30 May,"Fewer married women are deciding for themselves on how they should spend their earnings now than 15 years ago, while an increasing proportion of them making that decision jointly with their husbands.At the same time, one in six married women with an income reported that they have no say in how their earnings are used, and this proportion remains unchanged from a decade and a half ago, data collected by the National Family Health Survey (NFHS) shows. The decisions in such households continue to be taken by the husbands.The decline in the proportion of women deciding independently on how to use their earnings was seen when in a parallel move hordes of women withdrew from the workforce.The national report of the latest round of the NFHS, or the fifth round conducted between 2019 and 2021, published earlier this month shows that just about 18 percent of married women with an income were making decisions independently on how to spend their earnings. When the third round of the survey was conducted in 2005-06, that proportion stood at 24 percent. The proportion of women who said that these decisions were made jointly with their husbands climbed 10 percentage points to 67 percent over the same period.The 2005-06 round of the survey had estimated the share of married women in the age group 15-49 years in employment at 43 percent. That proportion had declined to 32 percent during the fifth round, which was slightly better than 31 percent recorded in 2015-16.The drop in the proportion of married women who decided themselves how their earnings were spent was visible across both urban and rural India as also among those with different levels of education. Only women from the wealthiest section defied the trend – the proportion of such women making an independent decision on spending saw a tiny decline.Decision on men's earningsOn wives’ getting a say in how men’s earnings were used, a larger proportion of women said that decisions were taken jointly compared to 15 years earlier. Compared to 62 percent of women reporting in 2005-06 that these decisions were taken jointly, the share had climbed to 71 percent. Also, there was a small drop in the proportion stating that their husbands decided themselves – from 25 percent in 2005-06 to 21 percent in 2019-21. Just a little more than six percent of married women say that they could decide themselves how their husbands’ earnings were used.When the men were asked same question - who decided on how their incomes were used - there wasn’t any change between the two rounds of the survey. The proportion that said that decisions were taken jointly was almost unchanged at 66 percent. The proportion of men who said that they alone decided how their income was used stood at around 28 percent in both rounds - which incidentally was a higher than was reported by women. That indicates that many men were either unwilling to acknowledge that joint decisions were taken or that the women were made to believe that they had a say in how their husband's income was used. The proportion of men who said that their wives decided independently how their incomes were used rose – from 2 percent to 6 percent.Shopping decisionsThe most significant change in women’s participation in decision making was seen when major household purchases were made. Fewer men were making that decision themselves. As a result, the proportion of households where the decision was made jointly by the husband and wife jumped from 44 percent in 2005-06 to 72 percent in 2019-21. The proportion of men taking the decision unilaterally halved from 32 percent in 2005-06.Men were also questioned on their attitudes towards their wives’ participation in decision making. The proportion of men who felt that wives should decide themselves how they used their earnings dropped from 20 percent to about 18 percent in 15 years and the proportion of those who felt that the husband should decide rose by two percentage points. A majority of the men wanted decisions taken jointly.On major household purchases, very few men were willing to let that decision be made by their wives (less than 10 percent) but more than a fourth wanted to take that decision by themselves.

Markets are on a roll as the BSE Sensex rose to 58,247.09 and the Nifty50 hit a fresh record high of 17,438.55 before closing at 17,380 on September 14, 2021.Nineteen fund managers managing Rs 3.84 lakh crore of assets participated in the fourth edition of the survey.About 74 percent of the fund managers surveyed believe that equities will generate the best return over the next year with Nifty expected to reach 18,000 during the same period. Internet companies and 'Make in India' will be the two big investment themes over the next 12 months, the survey revealed.While the majority of the experts think that it is the financial sector that has the potential to take the markets further up, the US Federal Reserve raising interest rates earlier than expected is seen as the biggest risk to the present market rally.Slightly over half of the respondents expect the quantitative easing to end soonest by end-FY22, and nearly a third expect it to end by the middle of FY22, indicating risk to the market is equally stacked from possible easing ahead of end-FY22.Meanwhile, for the long-term investors, the biggest worry is the long absence of meaningful Capex thwarting growth, followed by the overvaluation of equities and rising interest rates.Here’s what the survey findings revealed:",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/september-2021-moneycontrol-market-sentiment-survey-equities-remain-preferred-asset-class-among-investors-7468681.html,Research,"Markets are on a roll as the BSE Sensex rose to 58,247.09 and the Nifty50 hit a fresh record high of 17,438.55 before closing at 17,380 on September 14, 2021.Nineteen fund managers managing Rs 3.84 lakh crore of assets participated in the fourth edition of the survey.About 74 percent of the fund managers surveyed believe that equities will generate the best return over the next year with Nifty expected to reach 18,000 during the same period.Internet companies and 'Make in India' will be the two big investment themes over the next 12 months, the survey revealed.While the majority of the experts think that it is the financial sector that has the potential to take the markets further up, the US Federal Reserve raising interest rates earlier than expected is seen as the biggest risk to the present market rally.Slightly over half of the respondents expect the quantitative easing to end soonest by end-FY22, and nearly a third expect it to end by the middle of FY22, indicating risk to the market is equally stacked from possible easing ahead of end-FY22.Meanwhile, for the long-term investors, the biggest worry is the long absence of meaningful Capex thwarting growth, followed by the overvaluation of equities and rising interest rates.Here’s what the survey findings revealed:","['BSE Sensex', 'Nifty50', 'Nifty', 'the US Federal Reserve', 'Capex']",[]
Urban India’s perception of government’s handling of the pandemic improves: Report,18 August,"Post the deadly second wave of COVID-19 in India, the perception of urban population regarding the Centre’s handling of the pandemic has improved, according to a release by YouGov. However, the worry about the third wave is strong among people, the report said. The YouGov’s Covid-19 Public Monitor has been tracking public sentiment since the outbreak in 2020. The findings are based on responses collected from 5,977 urban adult individuals between June 1 and July 23, 2021.Between June 1 and 8, about 56 percent of the respondents said the government’s handling of the rollout of vaccines has been very or somewhat well. With the vaccination drive picking up pace, covering the 18+ population, this number has increased to 64 percent at the end of July (between 16-23 July). Likewise, the percent of people saying the government is doing a good job in ensuring those infected receive the best healthcare has increased from 54 percent to 61 percent during this period.The perception regarding the economic situation too has improved, findings show. Between 1-8 June, 38 percent respondents opined that the government is doing good in protecting jobs and 46 percent felt the same about the government protecting the economy. This number increased to 42 percent and 54 percent by the end of July.Respondents’ perception of the state government’s handling of the crisis is similar. However, there are differences within regions. In all, the percentage of respondents saying compared to a month ago the COVID-19 situation in India is getting better has gone up from 68 percent during the first wave in June to 76 percent at the end of July. Despite the improvement in confidence with respect to recovery since June, almost all the respondents are concerned about the third wave to some extent.About three in ten (29 percent) are extremely concerned, with respondents from east & northeast India most likely to say this than the rest (at 33 percent). While, seven percent of all respondents are not concerned at all. A quarter (24 percent) are ‘somewhat concerned’, with residents of west India more likely than the rest to say this at 29 percent. On a question--whether the Centre’s management of the pandemic will influence their voting choice in 2024 Lok Sabha Elections, 50 percent of the respondents said it is going to affect their choice “very much”; “somewhat” effect (36 percent) and will not influence their decision at all (14 percent).",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/trends/current-affairs-trends/urban-indias-perception-of-governments-handling-of-the-pandemic-improves-report-7356571.html,Research,"In all, the percentage of respondents saying compared to a month ago the COVID-19 situation in India is getting better has gone up from 68 percent during the first wave in June to 76 percent at the end of July.Despite the improvement in confidence with respect to recovery since June, almost all the respondents are concerned about the third wave to some extent.About three in ten (29 percent) are extremely concerned, with respondents from east & northeast India most likely to say this than the rest (at 33 percent).","['COVID-19', 'east &']",[]
76% homebuyers aware of RERA; only 22% satisfied with consumer redressal mechanism: Survey,28 July,"As many as 76 percent of consumers are aware of RERA and plan to buy only RERA registered properties and five out of six homebuyers seek redressal through RERA, a survey that assesses RERA performance in five Indian states across key dimensions has said.According to stakeholder perspectives from Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Orissa, and Karnataka, RERA has been effective in increasing consumer confidence and greater accountability.The survey said that while overall consumer awareness is high, the specific provisions of the law are still not well understood. It also shows that the implementation of the grievance redressal process still has many gaps.A survey by Omidyar Network India and Boston Consulting Group titled 'Five Years On: An assessment of RERA - The Road Ahead For a Stronger On-ground Regime' gauges its impact on the crucial real estate sector since its enactment five years ago.It points out that the implementation of the grievance redressal process still has many gaps as ""only 22 per cent of the consumers involved in a grievance redressal process were satisfied due to the uncertain timelines involved"".The survey points out that as many as 77 percent of all eligible projects have been registered under RERA.It said that there is a lot of work to be done to streamline the understanding of the provisions of RERA, increase stakeholder confidence through even greater transparency and improve the grievance redressal process as 30 percent of consumers surveyed were still unaware of RERA’s role as a regulator.One in two (50 percent) consumers reported being aware of just two benefits of the Act - the mandatory registration of the relevant projects and RERA as a grievance redressal forum, it said.Only 14 percent of all potential homebuyers have visited their relevant RERA site, and 24 percent of these consumers said that they were satisfied with the online experience.Among developers, 64 percent of those surveyed were highly satisfied with the RERA authority. As many as 55 percent of developers surveyed were also able to secure loans more easily due to RERA but 45 percent of all developers surveyed reported dissatisfaction with the RERA website, it said.With RERA now having been implemented in 26 states and UTs, this data also urges state RERAs and other policy stakeholders to build on consumer education and awareness, streamline processes and drive adherence across states; evaluate and steer policy-level shifts and thereby, facilitate growth and promotion of the sector.Based on in-depth interactions with over 1300 customers, developers and regulatory authorities, the report highlights the impact of the legislation on each of these stakeholders.The report assesses RERA performance in five Indian states across key dimensions — customer awareness and education, transparency, accountability, timely grievance redressal, and overall confidence in the real estate sector. It examines whether the law has been able to address challenges of lack of transparency and efficiency at a micro (householder) and macro (real estate sector) level.The report was released on July 28 by Surendra Bagde, Additional Secretary (Housing), MoHUA, Government of India, Shilpa Kumar, Partner, Omidyar Network India and Neetu Vasanta, Managing Director and Partner, Boston Consulting Group and will be distributed to the Prime Minister’s Office, Niti Aayog, Chief Ministers, State ministries, RERA authorities and Secretaries amongst other dignitaries in the public and private sector.“An average Indian household maintains 75 percent of all its assets in real estate. Combine this with the fact that 66 percent of civil cases in India are on land and property disputes, and it is obvious that RERA has a critical role to play. Our report shows that in the last five years, RERA has begun moving in the right direction, increasing consumer confidence in the real estate sector,” said Shilpa Kumar, Partner, Omidyar Network India.The report also points to the need for more focus on greater consumer awareness, better RERA websites and focussed grievance redressal to further improve consumer confidence in the sector.  This can drive better household balance sheets as well as India’s growth trajectory. Further, the report shows the direct impact good legislation can have on its constituents, Kumar said.“It is great to see the boost in consumer confidence that has been created by RERA over the last 5 years in the Real Estate Sector. However, there is still headroom to improve customer experience and unlock efficiencies in the sector by bringing in increased transparency and systemic accountability. A well-executed RERA can further improve private investments by 5-7 percent and potentially create 4-6 million additional jobs in the sector and related industries,” Neetu Vasanta, Managing Director and Partner, Boston Consulting Group.Speaking at the report launch event, Surendra Bagde, Additional Secretary (Housing) MoHUA,  said “The real estate sector’s contribution the country’s GDP is significant and our vision is to grant further impetus to the industry and make it a 1 trillion USD sector by 2030. The real-estate industry shows immense potential to grow once regulated by norms that instill confidence in homebuyers and developers alike,” he said.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/real-estate/76-homebuyers-aware-of-rera-only-22-satisfied-with-consumer-redressal-mechanism-survey-7240161.html,Research,"It also shows that the implementation of the grievance redressal process still has many gaps.A survey by Omidyar Network India and Boston Consulting Group titled 'Five Years On: An assessment of RERA - The Road Ahead For a Stronger On-ground Regime' gauges its impact on the crucial real estate sector since its enactment five years ago.It points out that the implementation of the grievance redressal process still has many gaps as ""only 22 per cent of the consumers involved in a grievance redressal process were satisfied due to the uncertain timelines involved"".The survey points out that as many as 77 percent of all eligible projects have been registered under RERA.It said that there is a lot of work to be done to streamline the understanding of the provisions of RERA, increase stakeholder confidence through even greater transparency and improve the grievance redressal process as 30 percent of consumers surveyed were still unaware of RERA’s role as a regulator.One in two (50 percent) consumers reported being aware of just two benefits of the Act - the mandatory registration of the relevant projects and RERA as a grievance redressal forum, it said.Only 14 percent of all potential homebuyers have visited their relevant RERA site, and 24 percent of these consumers said that they were satisfied with the online experience.Among developers, 64 percent of those surveyed were highly satisfied with the RERA authority.As many as 55 percent of developers surveyed were also able to secure loans more easily due to RERA but 45 percent of all developers surveyed reported dissatisfaction with the RERA website, it said.With RERA now having been implemented in 26 states and UTs, this data also urges state RERAs and other policy stakeholders to build on consumer education and awareness, streamline processes and drive adherence across states; evaluate and steer policy-level shifts and thereby, facilitate growth and promotion of the sector.Based on in-depth interactions with over 1300 customers, developers and regulatory authorities, the report highlights the impact of the legislation on each of these stakeholders.The report assesses RERA performance in five Indian states across key dimensions — customer awareness and education, transparency, accountability, timely grievance redressal, and overall confidence in the real estate sector.","['Omidyar Network India', 'Boston Consulting Group', 'RERA', 'The Road Ahead For a Stronger On-ground', 'involved""', 'RERA', 'RERA', 'RERA', 'RERA', 'RERA', 'RERA', 'RERA', 'RERA', 'RERA']",[]

This was followed by managing costs (56 percent) and tight financial liquidity (43 percent) that emerged as other significant issues companies have to deal with in the present situation, it added.The survey however noted that about 63 percent of the companies expect the utilization rates to be over 70 percent in the next two to four quarters.""While the impact of the second wave induced lockdowns on businesses is clearly visible, there is a silver lining on the horizon. This relates to expectations about business performance over the next 6-12 months.

"How COVID-19, citizenship protests delayed crucial survey that will improve inflation data",21 June,"A crucial, nationwide official survey of household consumption and spending, which will help revamp retail inflation data, is being deferred for two years because of the COVID-19 pandemic.Pronab Sen, head of the standing committee on statistics, told Moneycontrol that the Centre had suspended the work on consumer expenditure survey which was scheduled to begin from July this year.The survey has already been postponed many times since the beginning of last year, first due to the protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act in early 2020, and then the nationwide lockdown, he said. Sen was India’s first Chief Statistician.With lockdowns and curfews being imposed by various states across the country due to the second wave, and the resultant fear that has arisen, especially in rural areas, Sen said that the survey will now probably begin next calendar year.“We've been trying to update CPI inflation by conducting a household consumption expenditure survey, which is the basis for the CPI calculation. We were unable to do it the first time around because of protests against CAA. In some parts of the country, field investigators were not allowed into the village because they from the government and people thought that they had come to do the CAA work,” Sen said.“Then after that, we had to withdraw the field workers simply because that would be exposing them to an unacceptable level of risk. This time, it’s even worse now that Covid has spread strongly in rural India,” he said.Fear in Rural IndiaSurveyors will be provided protective equipment like masks and PPE kits, and many are fully vaccinated, being central and state government frontline workers, but there is still a level of risk involved, coupled with fear factor, especially in rural India.“This survey cannot be done over the phone, unlike the existing CPI data collection. These are a new set of questions with a new methodology and will have to be carried out-door-to-door,” Sen said.He cited examples of villages which, during the deadly second wave, were not letting their returning migrants come into the village and are quarantining them outside. “Hence it is uncertain how they would react to strangers,” he said.“We were planning to launch the survey in July. Now, that's clearly not happening. We are already talking about 2022,” Sen said. He, however, added that the date of commencement of the survey remains uncertain.“Till such time as both the threat of the pandemic and the fear factor are gone. We will have a hard time getting it done, “ Sen remarked.The former chief statistician said vaccinating a large portion of the population which is expected to be done in 2022 is a critical step but it does not guarantee sufficient reduction in the fear psychosis for the survey work to begin, particularly in rural India.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/india/how-covid-19-citizenship-protests-delayed-crucial-survey-that-will-improve-inflation-data-7063321.html,Research,"A crucial, nationwide official survey of household consumption and spending, which will help revamp retail inflation data, is being deferred for two years because of the COVID-19 pandemic.Pronab Sen, head of the standing committee on statistics, told Moneycontrol that the Centre had suspended the work on consumer expenditure survey which was scheduled to begin from July this year.The survey has already been postponed many times since the beginning of last year, first due to the protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act in early 2020, and then the nationwide lockdown, he said.Sen was India’s first Chief Statistician.With lockdowns and curfews being imposed by various states across the country due to the second wave, and the resultant fear that has arisen, especially in rural areas, Sen said that the survey will now probably begin next calendar year.“We've been trying to update CPI inflation by conducting a household consumption expenditure survey, which is the basis for the CPI calculation.","['COVID-19', 'the standing committee on statistics', 'Moneycontrol', 'Centre', 'Sen']",[]
25% buyers considering purchasing property for investment purpose: Survey,18 November,"With attractive discounts and offers made available by developers during the festive season, investors are now scouting for attractive deals in the market and contribute to at least 25 percent of buyers who intend to purchase property. As many as 9 percent respondents actually bought a property during the COVID-19 period, a new survey has said.Every one in three people are looking for high discounts and distress sale opportunities, the Magicbricks Property Buyer's Sentiment Survey 3rd Edition has said.The portal claimed that it had witnessed a surge in property searches on its platform and they had surpassed the pre-COVID levels by 30 percent to 40 percent.The survey said that around 25 percent of the respondents are now looking for property as an investment as compared to 13 percent just three months ago. This bodes well for the property market.The first (April) and the second (July) edition of the sentiment survey had revealed that investors had exited the market amidst uncertainty. Now their return augurs well for the industry, which is now witnessing a renewed interest from all segments of consumers indicated by the increased traffic on the portal, Magicbricks said in a statement.The latest sentiment survey states that one third of the buyers are now looking to buy on the availability of discounts launched by many developers across the country in a bid to reduce their inventory overhang.“The onset of the festive season coincides with the time when most of the companies have started to improve their outlook and plans for growth. With uncertainties around the economy and jobs now stabilising, we are witnessing a surge in property searches on our platform and it has surpassed the pre-COVID levels by 30%-40%,” said Sudhir Pai, CEO, Magicbricks.“This bodes well for the industry and the next six months would be crucial for the real estate industry as we hope this pent-up demand converts into transactions,” he said.The survey states that ‘Opportunist Searches’ have increased during the pandemic with every 1 in 3 people looking for high discounts and distress sale opportunities.Besides, the supply side push such as an all-time low interest on home loans and stamp duty waiver in some states also helped to push the fence-sitting buyers to execute the transactions.The survey said that price dynamics and incentives are likely to tap on the surge in demand.There is an increased maturity being observed in respondents during the current wave in October, with less than 45 percent of the respondents expecting the prices to decrease further, although discounts can act as a trigger to purchase property. In the first and the second wave (in April and July of the same year), about 3 out of 4 were expecting prices to decrease further, the survey said.Prices too have bounced back to pre-COVID levels in most cities, the survey added.The Magicbricks’ Property Buyer Sentiment Survey is designed to understand buyer’s updated outlook of the real estate market during the COVID-19 crisis, the current deciding factors for purchasing property and the new property preferences and consumption patterns.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/real-estate/25-buyers-considering-purchasing-property-for-investment-purpose-survey-6131671.html,Research,"Now their return augurs well for the industry, which is now witnessing a renewed interest from all segments of consumers indicated by the increased traffic on the portal, Magicbricks said in a statement.The latest sentiment survey states that one third of the buyers are now looking to buy on the availability of discounts launched by many developers across the country in a bid to reduce their inventory overhang.“The onset of the festive season coincides with the time when most of the companies have started to improve their outlook and plans for growth.With uncertainties around the economy and jobs now stabilising, we are witnessing a surge in property searches on our platform and it has surpassed the pre-COVID levels by 30%-40%,” said Sudhir Pai, CEO, Magicbricks.“This bodes well for the industry and the next six months would be crucial for the real estate industry as we hope this pent-up demand converts into transactions,” he said.The survey states that ‘Opportunist Searches’ have increased during the pandemic with every 1 in 3 people looking for high discounts and distress sale opportunities.Besides, the supply side push such as an all-time low interest on home loans and stamp duty waiver in some states also helped to push the fence-sitting buyers to execute the transactions.The survey said that price dynamics and incentives are likely to tap on the surge in demand.There is an increased maturity being observed in respondents during the current wave in October, with less than 45 percent of the respondents expecting the prices to decrease further, although discounts can act as a trigger to purchase property.",['Magicbricks'],[]
Survey: Did relationships become more equal at home during lockdown?,19 September,"The COVID lockdown created unprecedented crises in people’s lives. Naturally, intimate relationships have been impacted as well. With families constricted within homes for long periods, domestic helpers unavailable, schools closed and children stuck indoors, and adults working from home, the load of housework has also gone up.eShe magazine conducted an online survey last month to find out how marriages and families had been affected in the lockdown, with a focus on gender-based division of household responsibilities. Questions were multiple-choice, with some of the questions having space for ‘other’ answers. Giving names was optional. Ninety percent of the 151 respondents were married or in a long-term committed relationship.Asked if gender stereotypes were reinforced – of women being “caregivers” and men “breadwinners” – over 40 percent of respondents believed they were. “We Indians never seem to learn,” wrote one of the respondents, a man in his thirties. “I think a pandemic makes it worse because the so-called males don’t end up doing any kind of work. At least during normal times, they go to work and contribute by earning. So, no, I don’t think it encourages any kind of equality.”However, 37 percent felt that stereotypes were not reinforced, and see hope for change. One of them, Pratibha, who is in her forties, wrote, “As both of us set up our work desks in two corners of the same room, we both started seeing what the other person goes through in their daily work schedule. We ended up being more understanding, helpful and thoughtful of each other’s needs. Lockdown has only strengthened our relationship.”Read on to know the rest of the survey results.COVID-19 VaccineFrequently Asked QuestionsA vaccine works by mimicking a natural infection. A vaccine not only induces immune response to protect people from any future COVID-19 infection, but also helps quickly build herd immunity to put an end to the pandemic. Herd immunity occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population becomes immune to a disease, making the spread of disease from person to person unlikely. The good news is that SARS-CoV-2 virus has been fairly stable, which increases the viability of a vaccine.There are broadly four types of vaccine — one, a vaccine based on the whole virus (this could be either inactivated, or an attenuated [weakened] virus vaccine); two, a non-replicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of SARS-CoV; three, nucleic-acid vaccines that have genetic material like DNA and RNA of antigens like spike protein given to a person, helping  human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine; and four, protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombinant proteins of SARS-COV-2 along with an adjuvant (booster) is given as a vaccine.Vaccine development is a long, complex process. Unlike drugs that are given to people with a diseased, vaccines are given to healthy people and also vulnerable sections such as children, pregnant women and the elderly. So rigorous tests are compulsory. History says that the fastest time it took to develop a vaccine is five years, but it usually takes double or sometimes triple that time.These lockdown months have taken a toll on women in more than one way, whether they are professionals or homemakers. While talking to my close friends or cousins, the sentence I heard most was, “I don’t want to do anything for the next 24 hours and want to just shut myself in a room.”Shubhonita Chatterjee, a working mom, shares her experience: “It has been incredibly stressful trying to juggle kids, office and home in the past few months. Managing timelines has been a daunting task.”Aparna Jain, author and leadership coach, adds, “Women are doing a lot more emotional and invisible labour because they are at home.” On top of that, she says, instances of domestic violence have gone up globally.Psychologist and therapist Dr Shambhavi Alve agrees: “For many, the lockdown has proved to be nothing less than a curse; being locked up with the abuser and finding nowhere to escape can result in extreme trauma for these women.”She adds that even if they are not subject to violence, working women have faced extreme stress during the lockdown. “The situation becomes even more taxing if she is the only earning member or a single parent,” she notes.But Shambhavi believes that, sometimes, women need to introspect. “While we conveniently blame men for perpetuating gender-stereotypical beliefs, women equally share these biases. This often holds them back from asking for help from their partners,” she says.One survey respondent, a woman in her thirties who said her relationship became worse during the lockdown, simply replied with a crying emoji in the opinion box.There are, of course, instances of men being more cooperative during the lockdown: 55 percent of respondents said that men were doing more at home than before.One woman in her fifties wrote, “Because of my previous breast cancer and my being a decade older, my husband takes the risk of all shopping and errands. He’s been creative, attentive and thorough, and I think he’s even enjoying it! I’m definitely enjoying the downtime!”Priyanka Mehra, 36, seconds that: “My husband does not believe in stereotypes; we do all household chores together. Sometimes, in fact, he is more involved as I go to the office and he manages his business from home.” Priyanka has a son, and she believes that we need to teach boys from the very beginning that housework is equal responsibility.But not all men have been as proactive. Aparna points out, “Much of the cooking and cleaning by men during lockdown was performative for social media, replete with funny captions. Did it bring about a change in their mindset or habits? That is yet to be seen.”Another issue women raised was that men need to be ‘requested’ to do housework. Entrepreneur Alpana Parida says, “Women have it ingrained that household work is their responsibility. Men won’t touch it unless asked specifically. This habit didn’t change even one bit in lockdown.”Student Tvesha Jainn, 21, notes a generational divide in division of labour: “I live with one younger couple and one who is older. The young couple is getting closer because of equal involvement, whereas the elder couple’s relationship is getting worse because the men of the previous generation seem to be more patriarchal and expect the women to do the work.”Three in four survey respondents, however, share that women in their families are still doing more housework than men, even if men have been stepping up more of late.Marketing professional Priyanka Tiku Tripathi points out another aspect of the lockdown: the physical confinement in compact Indian homes. “I dread to think about smaller dwellings where families live in much tighter spaces through the day. I am sure it leads to frustrations, high mental pressure, aggressive behaviour and abuse.”Her fears are not unfounded. Almost 63 percent of respondents faced or came across mental-health issues in friends and family during these months. Besides the physical, financial and psychological stress, not to mention fear of COVID, the pressure of being together 24/7 has created its own problems.“Having family members always at home and in our face is making the scenario worse and women irritated! I was happier when we were both busy in our respective office spaces and had to spend only a couple of hours in the evening together. Too much of anything becomes unbearable!” wrote a woman in her thirties.  Another one in her forties wrote: “[The issue] is about compatibility and patience, which the lockdown has tested; 24 hours of togetherness is not humane!”But there is always reason to be optimistic. “Since partners are together 24/7, there is more opportunity to see, appreciate and empathise with the other’s workload. If there is compassion and understanding in the relationship, it will encourage more equality in sharing the workload,” wrote Sanju Muttreja, who is in her sixties.The best news of the survey was that marriages and long-term relationships largely became better (50 percent) during the lockdown, or else reported no difference (40 percent).Less than 10 percent reported things becoming worse. Though their experiences are heartwrenching (“I wish no one should face what I faced,” wrote a woman in her twenties), on the whole respondents showed hope for more equality in relationships.“Lockdown is giving an opportunity to reset and refresh every aspect of our living life. Gender parity can’t be left untouched. We will see a softer, empathic and a more balanced relating,” predicted a woman in her forties. We leave you with some more ideas expressed by the respondents in the survey.Do you think the lockdown experience will encourage more equal relationships?“It should. It’s high time we all realise that the female gender is not synonymous to househelp. Cooking and cleaning should be basic responsibilities of both.”“It will only encourage equal relationships in partners who have been raised already without predefined gender roles. To most others, it will hardly make a difference and will anyway go back to where it was pre-lockdown once all this is behind us.”“When job opportunities are limited and there’s no domestic help, it’s obvious which gender will be forced to give up their jobs and do what needs to be done at home. I’m afraid this pandemic will have devastating results for the emancipation of women.”“I don’t see why we need a lockdown to have more equal relationships. That should be the case irrespective of the circumstance. Respect and equality are the cornerstones of any relationship, and the pandemic has only emphasised that. If that’s missing in a relationship, then the quality of the relationship is anyway on a downward spiral.”“When everything is back to normal, I wish men don’t go back to saying ‘domestic work is not my job’. This is not the normal women want to go back to. Yes, husbands have stepped up and have started contributing to the domestic work but I see that it comes down as ‘help’ to the woman and not as equal participation. This is worrying but at least now they know the physical and mental pain that a woman takes in making the house a home. We need to make sure these learnings are not lost and we do not have to wait till another COVID happens for things to change.”Lead representative image: Anastasia Shuraeva / Pexels.

"Indians concerned about security of data shared with banks, retailers, survey finds",10 August,"Despite Digital India getting a policy push, concerns around the security of online banking and commercial transactions are high among Indians, a global survey conducted by Unisys, an international information technology company, has found. As many as 82 percent respondents from the country expressed concerns about unauthorised access to credit card or debit card details.When it came to willingness to use a mobile app with facial recognition to access various services, the percentage of individuals willing to take this route to avail financial services such as credit cards or home loans was considerably less as compared to other online services considered.Indians also expressed unwillingness to share personal data on buying habits with their banks or retailers, despite benefits such as alerts about suspicious activity or personalised offers from retailers, the survey found. The top reason given for this unwillingness was attributed to concern around security of the data shared, the survey by Unisys showed. The company has been publishing Unisys Security Index since 2007.The findings also revealed that the majority of Indians are willing to share private data with the government in return for citizen benefits. This includes location data so police can find them in an emergency or data on their travel habits so they can get through airport security quickly, with 79 percent and 73 percent of respondents willing to share this data with the government.The study revealed that 73 percent respondents were willing to share health record data with insurance companies for recommendations on addressing potential medical issues, while 72 percent were willing to share data with government agencies to expedite access to services such as driver’s license and government benefits.“The findings show Indian consumers are very aware of data security threats in the digital world with financial data targeted by malicious attacks.

India’s COVID-19 anxiety score highest in world: Report,28 May,"Indian consumers are the most worried people across the world on the uncertainties that lie ahead due to the coronavirus lockdown, Business Line reported quoting a survey conducted by Deloitte on May 16.During the survey, respondents aged above 18 years were asked if they felt more anxious than last week.For live updates on coronavirus, click hereIndia ranked highest in this global anxiety index, with a score of 33. The next in line was Mexico at 17, followed by Spain at 14 – both scores remarkably less than India’s.During a previous survey conducted on May 3, India’s score was 57. This means the anxiety level of Indians has since reduced.COVID-19 VaccineFrequently Asked QuestionsA vaccine works by mimicking a natural infection. A vaccine not only induces immune response to protect people from any future COVID-19 infection, but also helps quickly build herd immunity to put an end to the pandemic. Herd immunity occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population becomes immune to a disease, making the spread of disease from person to person unlikely. The good news is that SARS-CoV-2 virus has been fairly stable, which increases the viability of a vaccine.There are broadly four types of vaccine — one, a vaccine based on the whole virus (this could be either inactivated, or an attenuated [weakened] virus vaccine); two, a non-replicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of SARS-CoV; three, nucleic-acid vaccines that have genetic material like DNA and RNA of antigens like spike protein given to a person, helping  human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine; and four, protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombinant proteins of SARS-COV-2 along with an adjuvant (booster) is given as a vaccine.Vaccine development is a long, complex process. Unlike drugs that are given to people with a diseased, vaccines are given to healthy people and also vulnerable sections such as children, pregnant women and the elderly. So rigorous tests are compulsory. History says that the fastest time it took to develop a vaccine is five years, but it usually takes double or sometimes triple that time.Notably, India has been occupying the top spot since the first survey was conducted in April. In the meantime, countries like Japan and Italy, which topped the charts in the first half of May, moved down several spots on the index.Commenting on the results, Anil Talreja, Partner, Consumer Industry, Deloitte India, said: “The survey gives a pulse of consumer behaviour and trends during these challenging times. It gives a reflection of heightened consumer apprehensions, which are at the core of their decision-making. This, in turn, will also steer consumer product companies to build their new strategies around sales and marketing. Building value for brands virtually is going to be another task that companies would need to focus on in future.”The first such survey was undertaken on April 13 across 13 countries.

"‘Where’s the money going to come from’, Economic Survey asks Budget",04 July,"                        Ravi Krishnan

The writing is clear on the wall. The Indian economy is doing badly. Growth is expected to pick up, but not to the desired extent.

Downside risks still remain, such as an extended slowdown in consumption. The government has been trying – and perhaps the Budget will introduce further measures – to address rural distress and falling consumption, but its hands are severely constrained by lack of resources.

In Friday’s Budget, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman will have to delicately balance...

Economic Survey wants India to follow China’s shining example,04 July,"Manas ChakravartyThis year’s Economic Survey makes explicit what has all along been the view of this government -- India should emulate the East Asian growth model, in particular the Chinese one.The Survey says, “The overwhelming evidence across the globe, especially from China and East Asia in recent times, is that high growth rates have only been sustained by a growth model driven by a virtuous cycle of savings, investment and exports catalysed and supported by a favourable demographic phase.”The key driver of growth, says the Survey, has to be investment. It “drives demand, creates capacity, increases labour productivity, introduces new technology, allows creative destruction, and generates jobs”.There’s nothing new about this argument. Indeed, the Economic Survey for 2017-18 had said, “Above all, India must continue improving the climate for rapid economic growth on the strength of the only two truly sustainable engines — private investment and exports.” And the East Asian model of export-led growth has been the guiding light for all developing economies.The problem, of course, is how to get from an economy powered by consumption to an investment-driven one. But first, the Survey brushes aside some objections from the naysayers. Won’t this focus on investment lead to fewer jobs, because investment these days is capital-intensive? No, says the Survey, China has created jobs despite its high rate of investment. Investment increases productivity and competitiveness and therefore, exports and jobs. Aren’t household savings coming down? Savings will rise because we have a demographic dividend. That’s how it happened in China and East Asia.Won’t the current trade wars affect exports? No, because India’s export share is so small that we can always gain market share – indeed, the current US face-off with China gives us an opportunity to insert our firms into global supply chains.So, what do we need to do to increase investment? We need a high savings rate, which will come with good jobs. “Jobs that pay meaningful wages become crucial in driving savings rate in the economy,” says the Survey. That will mean increasing formalisation of the economy. Within the formal sector, it is large firms, young and old, that account for the bulk of employment. We need, therefore not only to create conditions that encourage start-ups, but ensure that these firms grow into large ones. Removing the skewed incentives that make them stay small is, therefore, needed. These include ensuring that incentives to small industries lapse after they’ve been operating for a few years. And it includes removing restrictive labour laws.The virtuous circle -- more investment, more productivity, more exports, better technology, more formalisation of the economy, higher wages, more savings, more investment -- will drive growth.How do we create a conducive environment for investment? The Survey says we need to lower the cost of capital. It says, “A cross-country comparison shows that the cost of capital remains quite high in India, which affects investment prospects in the country.”We also need a tax policy that will encourage investment. The post-tax return on investment needs to go up. Investors will cheer its prescription on capital gains tax -- the Survey says, “Capital gains tax can have significant economic consequences for individual investors in terms of its lock-in effects and associated deterring incentives to use capital gains into riskier investments.”The Survey adds that it has been guided by “blue sky” thinking. The East Asian model, which has been extensively analysed and debated, was perhaps blue sky a quarter of a century ago and is now much more overcast. But then, what other successful model of development do we have?",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/opinion/economic-survey-wants-india-to-follow-chinas-shining-example-4169551.html,Research,"Manas ChakravartyThis year’s Economic Survey makes explicit what has all along been the view of this government -- India should emulate the East Asian growth model, in particular the Chinese one.The Survey says, “The overwhelming evidence across the globe, especially from China and East Asia in recent times, is that high growth rates have only been sustained by a growth model driven by a virtuous cycle of savings, investment and exports catalysed and supported by a favourable demographic phase.”The key driver of growth, says the Survey, has to be investment.Indeed, the Economic Survey for 2017-18 had said, “Above all, India must continue improving the climate for rapid economic growth on the strength of the only two truly sustainable engines — private investment and exports.” And the East Asian model of export-led growth has been the guiding light for all developing economies.The problem, of course, is how to get from an economy powered by consumption to an investment-driven one.",['the Economic Survey'],[]

Digital payments – Analysing the cyber landscape: KPMG India,17 April,"Post demonetisation, Government of India took several steps to ensure smooth transition to a digital or a cashless economy. Initiatives such as ’Digital India’ aim at transforming India into a digitally empowered society and expect to further accelerate awareness, availability and adoption of digital technologies.However, the benefits of digital payments also increase the level of risks involved. The principal concern over the rush to digital economy is the growing threats of cyber-attacks across sectors. Lack of awareness among customers and weak digital payment ecosystem are the key reasons that have amplified the chances of getting exposed to cybersecurity risks such as online fraud, information theft, and malware or virus attacks.In this thought leadership, we examined the digital payments ecosystem (in India) from a lens of readiness of framework for adopting the technology, emergence of new industry (Fintech), security and preventive measures that an Indian citizen needs to take before taking a leap of faith in the digital world, and measures to avoid frauds.The report also discusses key findings from the survey conducted by KPMG in India for various customers and users across different sectors on key aspects such as acceptance, key barriers, challenges and awareness of the digital payment ecosystem post demonetisation.

Many of the large-size and recognized developers got a B+ (Outlook Stable), while some of the larger developers by market size, got a B Rating (Negative to Stable) or C Rating (Outlook Negative). While the Indian real estate companies are adopting some of the globally recognised best practices, the sector has to travel a long way. Bengaluru-based Sobha Limited is at the top with an A+ Rating, followed by Godrej Properties and the Prestige Group. Out of the 10 well-defined metrics of the survey, Sobha Limited ranks at the top on six of those metrics, while Godrej Properties stands at the top on four metrics. What has elevated the positioning of Sobha Limited is the fact that they have been way ahead of other developers, in a 20-city public perception survey. Overall, the performance of developers in South India, and Bengaluru-based developers in particular, has been better than developers in other parts of the country. Other than these, the corporate conglomerates have registered their presence, with decent track record of best practices in the business. What comes out as a significant finding of the study, is the fact that size alone does not determine the standing of a developer in adoption of best practices. Mumbai-based Omkar Realtors & Developers or Rustomjee may not have national footprints, and yet, their track record of best practices is much better than many developers with a national footprint. Similarly, Kolkata-based Srijan Realty with limited projects, Mumbai-based Radius Developers with a decent beginning and the Central Park project in Gurgaon-Sohna Road, could figure way ahead of some of the market front runners, in launching very many projects. Prateek Group, a Noida-based developer with only a handful of projects, also stands out as trustworthy developer. The track record of large-sized developers, like Jaypee Group or Unitech was found to be negative. Similarly, in North India, a developer like Supertech with many projects, did not score very high on the desirable benchmark of best practices. Methodology used A list of 100 top companies was picked up and evaluated in this study. The companies were picked up based on their market size, market impact, market differentiation/contribution, investors’ choice and Public perception. These companies were thereafter evaluated on the defined metrics of: Fiscal management Execution Market depth Consumer connect Transparent deals Functional professionalism Care Employer Communication Desirable practices Each of these metrics have 5-7 sub-metrics and the process of evaluation has been in-house research, followed by qualitative survey among the organised segment of investors, HNIs, NRIs and other influential stakeholders of the Indian real estate. This was further followed with a pan-India public perception survey. A sample size of 10,000 respondents were interviewed with a set of open-ended and close-ended questions to understand the consumer psychograph and outlook about these real estate companies.By: Housing.com/news",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/personal-finance/sobha-gets-top-honoursindiaâ€™s-first-ever-real-estate-best-practices-audit-report-940910.html,Research,"Out of the 10 well-defined metrics of the survey, Sobha Limited ranks at the top on six of those metrics, while Godrej Properties stands at the top on four metrics.These companies were thereafter evaluated on the defined metrics of: Fiscal management Execution Market depth Consumer connect Transparent deals Functional professionalism Care Employer Communication Desirable practices Each of these metrics have 5-7 sub-metrics and the process of evaluation has been in-house research, followed by qualitative survey among the organised segment of investors, HNIs, NRIs and other influential stakeholders of the Indian real estate.","['Sobha Limited', 'Godrej Properties', 'Care Employer Communication Desirable']",[]
Home buyer satisfaction index at all-time low: Survey,18 October,"A majority of Indians across the country are extremely apprehensive with the property market and feel that in spite of the slowdown, the industry’s practices have not changed. On a scale of 0-1,000, the satisfaction score, which measures several parameters including the market conditions, developers’ commitment and home buying experiences, was as low as 272 this year, compared to 358 last year and 373 a year before. Home buyers believe that developers continue to operate the same way, assuming that once the market conditions improve, the buyers will have no choice but to buy a product that is need-based. In terms of the level of satisfaction, more than half (54%), said that they were extremely dissatisfied with the real estate market, revealed the survey by Track2Realty, a real estate think-tank group. Another 28% said they were dissatisfied, while only 10% were satisfied and 8% were unsure or did not want to comment. The survey was conducted in 10 cities – Delhi-NCR, Mumbai, Kolkata, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Ahmedabad, Chennai, Pune, Jaipur and Chandigarh. Home buyers’ top complaints The top reasons for home buyers’ dissatisfaction include: Lack of transparency, which often results in hidden costs. One-sided builder-buyer agreements. Lack of communication in case of project delays. Mismatch between the sample/promised apartment and the one delivered. Problems pertaining to after-sale facility management. While judicial intervention and the media’s role in recent times, are welcome developments, they only pertain to a few exceptional cases, says Aditi Mishra, a home buyer in Gurgaon. “In a majority of the cases, the buyers have no choice but to wait endlessly for the project’s completion. Once the project is completed, the construction quality and facility management over the next few years, also remain sore points for home buyers. Nothing has changed on the ground, for buyer to trust this sector,” laments Mishra. “We read reports that in a slow-moving market, the developers have gone the extra mile, to connect with the home buyers. The reality on the contrary, is that the consumer connect is still missing in the sector. This absence of a meaningful dialogue, clearly shows how developers are taking the buyers for a ride,” concurs Rajat Mehta, in Mumbai. See also: Survey reveals Indian home buyers dissatisfied with current project quality Should the slowdown result in a price correction? A majority of the respondents (68%) blamed the developers’ unwillingness to reduce property rates, for the prolonged slowdown in the market. 26% even suggest that instead of waiting for the economic revival and serving the interest on their debt, if the developers reduced property prices, they could sell the inventory. This would also enhance their credibility, they felt. Only 6% felt that the slowdown was part of the economic cycle and that developers could not do much about it. When asked to identify the most important factor that shapes the public’s perception towards a developer, as many as 38% felt that it was a developer’s commitment to delivery timelines. Nearly as many (36%), said that it depends on fulfillment of promises, while 14% looked for communication at every level. Only 12% were convinced that the financial strength of the company, drives its brand image. Payment plans and hidden costs In terms of grey zones that turn the buyers away from a developer, 42% felt that the hidden costs in an apartment, were the worst nightmare. More than one-thirds (36%), felt that the escalation clause was nothing but arm-twisting by the developer, while 22% thought that the penalty clauses were heavily loaded in favour of the developers. In terms of sales methodology, nearly half of the home buyers (48%), were turned off by the developers’ arm-twisting tactics over the construction-linked plan (CLP). Buyers complained that while some developers simply do not entertain the CLP advertised in their sales brochure, others ask for as high as 40% in advance, with this plan. 32% call it a bad experience, when a broker offers an apartment at lesser price than advertised by the developer, while 28% find buyback guarantees and assured returns, as clear signs of the developers’ financial stress. Home buyers’ satisfaction index On a scale of 0-1000 the satisfaction score is as low as 272 this year, compared to 358 last year and 373 a year before. 54% home buyers are extremely dissatisfied with the property market; 28% are dissatisfied, while only 10% are satisfied and 8% are not sure. Top reasons for home buyers’ dissatisfaction, include lack of transparency, hidden costs, one-sided builder-buyer agreements, lack of communication in case of delays, mismatch between sample apartment and the one delivered and after-sale facility management. 68% believe that developers’ greed is behind the prolonged slowdown. 26% feel that developers should reduce prices to boost sales, while only 6% feel that the economic cycle is responsible for the slowdown. The biggest priority for home buyers is timely delivery (38%), followed by fulfillment of promises (36%), communication (14%) and financial strength of the company (12%). 42% feel hidden costs are the worst nightmare, while 36% disapproved of escalation clauses and 22% were unhappy with the penalty clauses.

India nearly doubles budget for digitisation of land records,07 September,"India will nearly double the budget and extend the deadline for a programme to digitise land records as states struggle to survey land and property, large chunks of which have not been mapped in a century, a senior official said.The national land record modernisation programme, launched in 2008, was aimed at surveying lands, upgrading records and establishing ownership. Scheduled to be completed in 2016 with a budget of 56 billion rupees (USD 841 million), the project will now conclude in 2021 at a projected cost of Rs 110 billion.""It is a long process, as some of these lands have not been surveyed in a long time, some for 30 years, some for 100 years,"" said K.K. Phull, a consultant with the department of land records in New Delhi.""Many states lack the means to survey lands, and for nearly all states this has not been a top priority so far, hence the delays,"" he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.The process includes mapping of land with aerial surveys, satellite imagery, drones, as well as physical markers. Existing land records are also verified and put online and linked to landowners.The programme aims to provide clear titles of ownership that should result in government officials being able to monitor land more easily, speedier transactions, fewer disputes over ownership and less corruption in administration, Phull said.Matters related to land and property make up about two thirds of all civil cases in the country, according to a recent study by Daksh, a legal advocacy group based in Bengaluru.India has introduced several land laws in the past decade to give more rights to farmers and indigenous people. But the complex web of legislation has not always helped the most vulnerable, with the lack of clear title deeds also a challenge.One of the main goals of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Digital India campaign launched last year was the digitisation of land records.States including Madhya Pradesh and Chattisgarh have completed the process to digitise land records, Phull said. Others including Andhra Pradesh, Telengana, Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra are scheduled to be done in a few months, he said.In Maharashtra, about 270 million documents are being digitised, with surveys under way in several districts, a spokesman for the land records department said.The move to extend the deadline and increase the budget for the programme is awaiting the cabinet's approval, Phull said.""Our attitude towards land records is to forget about them until there is a dispute or an emergency,"" Phull said.""Digitising land records can have far-reaching benefits for the country.

Mfg growth to be higher in Q2 on better export outlook: Poll,26 August,"India's manufacturing sector may witness higher growth during the July-September quarter buoyed by improvement in export prospects and domestic demand, even as the hiring outlook remains subdued, according to a survey.The latest quarterly survey by Ficci on manufacturing outlook for the second quarter also finds that the interest rate paid by the manufacturers still remains high and sticky.Uncertain economic environment, unfavourable market conditions, competition from imports, delayed clearances, inadequate infrastructure (especially availability of power) and cost escalation are some of the major constraints affecting the expansion plans of the industry, the poll noted.The survey had earlier indicated a slowdown for the first quarter of 2016-17, which seems to be waning.The proportion of respondents expecting higher growth during July-September quarter has risen to 55 percent as against 53 percent for April-June quarter 2016-17, although, it remains much below the percentage of 60 percent for January-March quarter of the previous fiscal.Manufacturing sector in India continued with its uptrend and hit a four-month high in July, backed by stronger upturn in new business orders.The Nikkei Markit India Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) - a composite indicator of manufacturing performance - rose to 51.8 in July from 51.7 in June.A reading above 50 denotes expansion while one below means contraction.The slight improvement in the outlook for manufacturing production in second quarter of 2016-17 is attributable to various factors including somewhat better outlook for exports compared to previous quarters, and better outlook on domestic demand front too, the survey pointed out.Export outlook for manufacturing in September quarter improved slightly as against the expectations for the first quarter. The proportion of respondents expecting higher exports in the second quarter rose by 5 percentage points to 41 percent as against 36 percent in 2016-17.However, hiring outlook remains subdued in manufacturing in coming months as three quarters of the participants in second quarter of 2016-17 are unlikely to hire additional workforce in next three months. The proportion remains almost similar to that recorded for June quarter (76 percent).Moreover, average interest rate paid by the manufacturers still reportedly remains high and sticky. The rate is as high as 15 percent as per the survey with average interest rate at around 11.5 percent per annum.The survey mapped expectations of manufacturers for thirteen major sectors namely auto, capital goods, cement and ceramics, chemicals, electronics & electricals, food products, leather and footwear, machine tools, metal and metal products, metal forging, paper products, textiles and technical textiles and textiles machinery.Responses have been drawn from 308 manufacturing units from both large and SME segments with a combined annual turnover of over Rs 4 lakh crore.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/economy/mfg-growth-to-be-higherq2better-export-outlook-poll-969675.html,Research,"India's manufacturing sector may witness higher growth during the July-September quarter buoyed by improvement in export prospects and domestic demand, even as the hiring outlook remains subdued, according to a survey.The latest quarterly survey by Ficci on manufacturing outlook for the second quarter also finds that the interest rate paid by the manufacturers still remains high and sticky.Uncertain economic environment, unfavourable market conditions, competition from imports, delayed clearances, inadequate infrastructure (especially availability of power) and cost escalation are some of the major constraints affecting the expansion plans of the industry, the poll noted.The survey had earlier indicated a slowdown for the first quarter of 2016-17, which seems to be waning.The proportion of respondents expecting higher growth during July-September quarter has risen to 55 percent as against 53 percent for April-June quarter 2016-17, although, it remains much below the percentage of 60 percent for January-March quarter of the previous fiscal.Manufacturing sector in India continued with its uptrend and hit a four-month high in July, backed by stronger upturn in new business orders.The Nikkei Markit India Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) - a composite indicator of manufacturing performance - rose to 51.8 in July from 51.7 in June.A reading above 50 denotes expansion while one below means contraction.The slight improvement in the outlook for manufacturing production in second quarter of 2016-17 is attributable to various factors including somewhat better outlook for exports compared to previous quarters, and better outlook on domestic demand front too, the survey pointed out.Export outlook for manufacturing in September quarter improved slightly as against the expectations for the first quarter.The proportion of respondents expecting higher exports in the second quarter rose by 5 percentage points to 41 percent as against 36 percent in 2016-17.However, hiring outlook remains subdued in manufacturing in coming months as three quarters of the participants in second quarter of 2016-17 are unlikely to hire additional workforce in next three months.","['Ficci', ""The Nikkei Markit India Manufacturing Purchasing Managers'"", 'PMI']",[]

Survey reveals Indian home buyers dissatisfied with current projects,11 July,"Real estate continues to remain an attractive investment option for Indians. Nevertheless, despite the attractive returns on investment, it may be time for a reality check. According to a pan-India survey by Track2Realty, more than eight out of ten (as many as 84%) home buyers are sulking and have serious issues with their developers, ranging from delayed possession and poor construction quality, to hidden costs and anomalies in the calculation of carpet area/super area. Last, but not the least, home buyers also cited problems with the facility management services of developers. Ninety per cent of home buyers feel that it is not early entry into a project that makes it a risky investment. Rather, they feel that the real issue is lack of regulation. “Once you pay the money, you are literally at the mercy of the builders. What makes the investment choice even more painful, is if you have opted for a down-payment plan. There is no escape, after having paid 90% of the apartment’s cost,” says Bengaluru-based home buyer, Joel Samuel. The survey revealed that 8% of the investors accepted the high risks associated with pre-launches, while 2% were not sure about it. In terms of allowing early entrants in the housing market to make money, 55% said that there should be an institutional mechanism on the lines of an IPO; 36% recommend crowdfunding to be officially institutionalised; while the rest 9% would like to wait till an official regulator comes into the picture. In the absence of regulation, over 46% home buyers across the country have serious issues with their developers, to the extent that reconciliation is not possible out of court. This is a significant increase from the 31% in a previous study, on the same subject in 2011. Nearly two-thirds (or 74%) of the home buyers said they would not like to invest with the same developer. This is 3% lower than the 2011 study. See also: Nationwide survey reveals investors still bet on real estate “Although I have invested in more than two projects of a particular builder, the overall experience has been pathetic. However, the builder is a reputed one and spends heavily on advertising. Hence, there is greater price appreciation in his projects, compared to better projects in the vicinity,” says Aradhana Das, a home buyer in Gurgaon. Investors’ satisfaction low Despite high investor activity, in the speculative markets like Noida, the investors’ satisfaction remains pretty low. Noida emerged as a highly depressed market for home buyers, followed by Ghaziabad, Nagpur, Gurgaon and Ahmedabad. In terms of consumer satisfaction, Bangalore topped the list, followed by Coimbatore, Chennai, Pune and Kolkata. On a scale of 0-1000, while the aspiration to invest in a home is 872, this score falls to 224 in terms of the satisfaction index. The subjects for the survey were predominantly middle-class and upper middle-class educated professionals. A significant number of the respondents were buyers of mid-segment and premium homes, with a mix of first-time and second-time home buyers. Close to two-thirds of the respondents (62%), were double-income families. A majority of the respondents were exposed to investments across the asset class and were conscious of the risks-versus-returns of these investment vehicles. In terms of their real estate portfolio, the respondents were carefully picked, to have a mix of end-users, as well as investors who had put their money in the sector.

'Engaging with start-up bring in innovative manner in work',02 May,"A half of Indian executives polled are open to work with start-ups as partnering with new-age companies bring in agile and innovative methods, says a survey. However, the other half is still sceptical about working with a start-up, according to annual EY-CIO Klub's Enterprise IT trends and investment survey titled 'the startup gene: a way forward'. The survey, which revolves around the idea of the startup gene, noted that the CIOs of the country can benefit from partnerships with start-ups and by imbibing the attitude of start-up entrepreneurs. About a half of 294 Chief Information Officers (CIOs) polled have shown faith in implementing start-up practices to get their work done. This was supplemented by the fact that 30 per cent of the respondents were aligned towards 'Do It For Me' approach, wherein the company would want to bring in external expertise to perform certain specific tasks, rather than doing it in-house. ""Partnering with start-ups ensures that work is done in an agile and innovative manner. This can save cost, help adopt the latest in technology and become a disruptive force in the industry. However, the report claims that to be more effective, CIOs should promote these values in their own firms. The only way to adapt to change is to take the risk of adopting it,"" the survey noted. The survey said, ""50 per cent of the CIOs are open to working with start-ups, while the other half is still sceptical."" Besides, 81 per cent of the CIOs consider that Internet-of-Things is the most imminent technology. Other trending technologies are high speed data transfer, wearable technologies and 3D printing. Cyber threat tops the list of key issues that give a CIO sleepless nights. While half the companies have in-house analytics functions, the other half believe that there is greater value in engaging with outside, specialised talent, as per the survey. ""CIOs have seldom been challenged for implementing an established Enterprise Resource Planning, but they have almost always been questioned when they recommend engaging with start-ups to acquire specialised expertise,"" EY India National Leader (Risk Advisory Services) Nitin Bhatt said.

Macro Economic Survey 2016: Govt must retain 3.5% fisc deficit goal ; FY17 GDP growth 7-7.5%,29 February,"Moneycontrol BureauEven as the debate over fiscal prudence versus growth rages, the Macro Economic Survey for 2016 has voted for fiscal discipline, saying that 'credibility and optimality argue for adhering to 3.5 percent fiscal deficit target' for FY17. The Survey said that the government needs to be in a strong position to service its debt. At the same time, the Survey has also forecast a difficult year ahead, with GDP growth for FY17 expected to be flat or lower at 7-7.5 percent.The Survey has projected a GDP growth of 7-7.5 percent for FY16, and the Central Statistical Organisation expects the economy to grow 7.6 percent this year.At the same time, the Survey also recognised the challenges in meeting the fiscal deficit target for FY17, in view of a slowing world economy, and the higher expenditure due to implementation of One Rank One Pension (OROP) and the Seventh Pay Commission report.  At the same time it has said that India needed a more relaxed monetary stance, meeaning that interest rates should be cut.Last year, the RBI had cut benchmark rates soon after the Union Budget, saying it was convinced by the government's commitment to fiscal consolidation.The Survey said that the fundamental task of the Budget should be to preserve fiscal sustainability. This is on the lines of what RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan has been arguing all along; that fiscal prudence was essential for sustainable growth.A higher fiscal deficit means the government will have to borrow more, in the process pushing up interest rates in the system. Economists welcomed the realistic projection, while saying that the Survey was now overcompensating for last year's estimates of 8-8.5 percent when it had considered only the positive aspects of the global economy. This time, they seem to be focussing on all the things that could go wrong with the economy, economists say.The Survey has express confidence that RBI's consumer inflation target of 5 percent by March 2017 will be achieved. However, economists feel that could be a challenge given the implementation of the Seventh Pay Commission Report and OROP.Some economists feel that even if the target of 5 percent consumer inflation is achieved, the average for FY17 as a whole could be higher. Some economists even felt that the government may defer the payout of house rent allowance under the Seventh Pay Commission so as to keep a leash on inflation, especially on house rents.The Survey said that public spending needed to be increased and that GDP growth could climb to 8 percent over the next couple of years.The Survey expects current account deficit for FY17 to be between 1-1.5 percent, adding that it would be more than adequately funded through stable capital flows.It also said that the government should plan for 'currency realignment' following the adjustments made by China in its currency. In other words, the Survey is saying that rupee should be allowed to weaken some more.Some economists have argued that a weak rupee was the best way to counter dumping and shore up exports. Also, in Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER) terms, the rupee has room on the downside though it is hovering around a 30-month low.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/economy/macro-economic-survey-2016-govt-must-retain-35-fisc-deficit-goalfy17-gdp-growth-7-75-1035767.html,Research,"At the same time, the Survey has also forecast a difficult year ahead, with GDP growth for FY17 expected to be flat or lower at 7-7.5 percent.The Survey has projected a GDP growth of 7-7.5 percent for FY16, and the Central Statistical Organisation expects the economy to grow 7.6 percent this year.At the same time, the Survey also recognised the challenges in meeting the fiscal deficit target for FY17, in view of a slowing world economy, and the higher expenditure due to implementation of One Rank One Pension (OROP) and the Seventh Pay Commission report.Some economists even felt that the government may defer the payout of house rent allowance under the Seventh Pay Commission so as to keep a leash on inflation, especially on house rents.The Survey said that public spending needed to be increased and that GDP growth could climb to 8 percent over the next couple of years.The Survey expects current account deficit for FY17 to be between 1-1.5 percent, adding that it would be more than adequately funded through stable capital flows.It also said that the government should plan for 'currency realignment' following the adjustments made by China in its currency.","['the Central Statistical Organisation', 'the Seventh Pay Commission', 'the Seventh Pay Commission', 'Survey']",[]
Expedia Vacation Deprivation Report 2015: Lack of Vacation Days Keeps Indians from Travelling to New Destinations,24 December,"Business Wire IndiaExpedia, one of the world's largest full service online travel sites, today released the results of the 2015 Vacation Deprivation® study, an annual study of vacation habits across multiple countries and continents. The survey highlights that India is the fourth most vacation deprived nation globally, with 65% of Indians saying they feel very or somewhat vacation deprived, and 20% saying they are very vacation deprived. “Vacations play a critical role in creating a work-life balance as it reenergizes people to be more focused at work (53% Indians agree). According to Expedia’s 2015 Vacation Deprivation Survey, 54% of Indians would prefer more vacation days over a pay rise, the highest globally. Sixty-one percent of Indians associate vacations a great deal with their overall happiness. In fact, 94% are ready to make sacrifices for just an extra day of vacation. The deprivation Indians are feeling may stem from the fact that 68% of Indians have cancelled or postponed their vacation due to work commitments.” said Mr. Manmeet Ahluwalia, Marketing Head, Expedia India. “The interesting fact is that while Indians are receiving on average, 1 addition vacation day this year (from 20 days last year to 21 this year) and are more likely to say their bosses are supportive of them taking their vacation time than they were last year (from 64% to 70%), they continue to take fewer days than they receive (an average of 16 days this year and last year).  This clearly shows that Indians are addicted to their work so much that they often choose to work even when they have earned their time off”, he added.DETAILED SURVEY FINDINGS: Do we travel?

Here's the latest Delhi post-poll survey,07 December,"The voters of Delhi seem to have pressed the exit button for the Congress in the December 4 Assembly elections. The ruling Congress is likely to be relegated to the third position after 15 years in the office.The CNN-IBN, The Week and CSDS post-poll survey predicts the end of Sheila Dikshit era in the national capital. It also predicts the arrival of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on the national scene as a serious player.Also Read: Delhi exit polls add to confusion, range make it less rightDelhi is likely to get a BJP government after 15 years, according to the survey. The main opposition party is likely to emerge either as the single largest party or as a clear winner with 32-42 seats, according to the seat projections provided by Chennai Mathematical Institute Director Professor Rajeeva Karandikar.The Arvind Kejriwal-led AAP is likely to come second with 13-21 seats while Congress is expected to win just 9-17 seats. Others in the fray are likely to get 1-5 seats in the 70-member Delhi Assembly.If the BJP falls short of a simple majority by 3-4 seats, it can look at others for the support. But, the other parties like the BSP, the JDU etc will have to win at least 4-5 seats to prevent a badly hung assembly in India's only city state.How Delhi votedThe BJP is expected to get 33 per cent of the votes, the AAP, which did not exist in the last elections, is likely to garner 27 per cent of the votes and the Congress is projected to get just 23 per cent of the votes. The BSP and Others are expected to bag 8 per cent and 9 per cent votes respectively.When compared to 2008 Assembly elections, the Congress seems to have lost 17 per cent of the votes. The BJP is expected to improve its percentage by 3 and the BSP is likely to lose 6 per cent votes.Price rise, voters craving for change and the allegations of corruption have hit the Sheila Dikshit government hard. Shockingly, the Sheila Dikshit government is extremely unpopular across Delhi.A massive 70 per cent of voters said that they are unhappy with her government and did not want her back as the Chief Minister for the 4th straight term. A mere 23 per cent wanted her back and 7 per cent had no opinion.The overall satisfaction level with the government has also come down to 40 per cent from 66 per cent in 2008. 56 per cent voters are dissatisfied with the government.Kejriwal most preferred choice for CMThe AAP convener tops the popularity graph as 27 per cent want him as the next Chief Minister of Delhi. BJP's Dr. Harsh Vardhan has got 22 per cent support and the incumbent Chief Minister Sheila Dikshit has got just 15 per cent backing for the top post.Sheila's popularity has also plummeted to all time low in the last 15 years. In 2008 it was 34 per cent and in 2009 it was 41 per cent. It had touched an all time high in 2004 with 56 per cent.Among the young voters in the age group of 18-25 years, Arvind Kejriwal is the most popular with 32 per cent votes.

CEO/CXO level gets around 24% of the pool. -- Close to two thirds of the companies do not grant options to Non Executive / Independent Directors. -- Companies are increasingly moving from individual performance criteria for vesting to vesting based on company performance targets (both top line and bottom line). -- Listed companies are increasingly outsourcing plan management “The trends over the last 3-4 years clearly show that companies have seen distinct advantages by issuing ESOPs by achieving higher retention and employee motivation”, said Harshu Ghate, Co-Founder & CEO at ESOP Direct. “Companies have also rectified some of the features and coverage criteria based on their experiences” he said.
