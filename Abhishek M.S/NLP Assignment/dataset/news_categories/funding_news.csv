Meet the startup using Ayurveda to help women have healthier periods,15 March,"In 2015, two lifestyle diseases, Psoriasis and Asthma, plagued Vishal Gupta’s health. Gupta tried various forms of medicine, but nothing worked. He then turned to Ayurveda, the ancient Indian medical system, and the results, he says, were “miraculous.”Gupta is the former chief operating officer at Binny Bansal-backed digital insurance startup Acko.“I saw similar results for several of my family members which deepened my belief in Ayurveda,” Gupta told Moneycontrol. In his quest to learn more about Aurveda, Gupta came across the Indian medicine system’s effects in curing menstrual health issues.In 2019, after raising a seed round from Fireside Ventures of $1 million, Gupta and his partner Rachana Gupta started up Gynoveda, a women's healthcare brand that sells Ayurvedic medicines to treat female disorders like Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) - a condition in which the ovaries produce an abnormally large amount of androgens or male hormones, irregular periods and infertility.This comes at a time when conversations around menstrual well-being are still considered taboo in parts of the country.Also read: Kiran Mazumdar Shaw invests in women’s health platform Gytree.comLatest funding round, growth plansThe husband-wife duo, along with gynecologist Dr Aarati Patil, on March 15, raised $10 million in Series A funding led by India Alternatives to double down on research and development, launch new ayurvedic offerings, and increase brand awareness.The funding will also help Gynoveda hire talent to boost growth. Currently, the company said a team of over 50 takes care of ayurveda, technology, content, and community for women’s healthcare.“We want to build a lean team. While we grow three times, we estimate our team size to double in that period,” Vishal Gupta, the chief executive officer of Gynoveda, said.With the fresh funding, the company also plans to open offline stores, it said without specifying a timeline. Gynoveda currently uses only D2C (Direct-to-Customer) channels like its website and e-commerce marketplaces.“About 80 percent of our business comes from our own website and the remaining 20 percent comes from Amazon, Flipkart, and Nykaa, apart from a few other marketplaces so we are widely available in the online space,” Gupta said.As of now, the company has delivered over 400,000 orders across 20,000 pin codes in more than 50 cities. Now, Gupta believes it is time for the company to involve doctors and pharmacies as it targets business-to-business channels to boost growth.Mission to change women’s lives“Gynoveda tripled its revenue year-on-year between FY20 and FY23 to reach a ₹100 crore annual revenue run rate within 3 years of its inception. Gynoveda is on a mission to change the lives of 1 million women, which is still a fraction of the billion women worldwide that need this unique ayurvedic solution,"" Gupta added.Shivani Bhasin Sachdeva, founder, managing director and chief executive officer of the India Alternatives Private Equity Fund, believes the investment fits in perfectly with the PE firm’s investment themes of women and health.Also read: Women-led startups keep funding winter at bay, raise over $4 bn in 2022“Today, over 40 percent of online shoppers are women, up from 10 percent a few years ago.

Influencer marketing platform One Impression raises $10 mn from Krafton-led funding round,15 March,"Influencer marketing platform One Impression announced on March 15 that it has raised $10 million in a Series A funding led by South Korean gaming giant Krafton, signifying a spike in investor interest in the burgeoning creator economy.Prior to this, the startup had raised $1-million seed funding from angel investors such as Lenskart founder Peeyush Bansal, People Group CEO Anupam Mittal and celebrities such as Olympian Neeraj Chopra and Comedian Zakir Khan in January 2022.One Impression plans to use the funds raised to grow its presence in international markets starting with Southeast Asia and United Arab Emirates (UAE) and invest in product development to expand its product offerings. The proceeds would also go towards the company's sales and marketing initiatives.""Until now, our entire business was built in an organic way, so we haven't spent a single dollar on marketing till date. But now that our product has really matured, we will start investing aggressively in sales and marketing. We will expand our sales team to about 50-70 people,"" One Impression chief executive Apaksh Gupta told Moneycontrol.Gupta said they will also look at acquiring smaller companies in the space, both in Indian and international markets, to expand to new markets.

Gupta said they currently support YouTube and Instagram with plans to integrate platforms such as LinkedIn in the future.""We believe that technology will bring the next phase of growth for the creator ecosystem. The ecosystem lacks a structured platform and our products will enable speed, scale, science, and reliability for all stakeholders in the industry,"" Gupta said.The platform claims that it transacts with tens of thousands of creators ranging from top celebrities to nano influencers generating over 100,000 content pieces for more than 500 brands in over 10 languages. Some of the brands include Unilever, Amazon, Meesho, Myntra, Mamaearth, Zomato, and Cetaphil.

"Fasal forays into farm output business, in talks to raise funds",28 February,"Precision farming-based agritech startup Fasal has entered the farming output business under the brand, Fasal Fresh, at a time when agritech startups record growth on the back of rising demand for quality food, supported by macro tailwinds like climate change and food security concerns.Fasal Fresh, which has been in the works since last year, is a B2B (business-to-business) brand that will bring the produce grown through precision farming to consumers through retailers, e-commerce players, wholesalers, and exporters, the company said on February 28.“We will have lesser wastage because we are directly harvesting from the farm based on demand from such players, not harvesting and then finding a customer for that produce,” Fasal founder, Shailendra Tiwari told Moneycontrol on a virtual interaction.Fasal said this move will also help the agritech player remove intermediaries in the sales process of agricultural commodities, reducing touch points for the produce, ensuring fairer prices for the farmers, and making procurement easy for the buyers.Fasal Fresh is now operational in Delhi, Bengaluru, and Hyderabad with its Mumbai operations planned for March this year, the company said.This comes after a year when private equity and venture capital investors shifted focus towards profitability, biggies in sectors like edtech, e-commerce, and fintech – the poster boys of 2021 startup bash, had to take a step back to re-evaluate their strategies and align themselves to the fundamentals.For the agritech ecosystem that witnessed valuations shooting up and continued funding with unwavering investor interest, there seems to be no end to the party.Fundraising plansAccording to Tiwari, Omnivore-backed Fasal is also in talks to raise a new round of funding to support its output business foray, amid an impending funding winter.“We definitely require capital because this (the foray) is rather transformational. We are in process of raising money and it is fair to say, one more round of capital will take us to the next phase,” Tiwari told Moneycontrol, without disclosing further details on the round.Earlier in November 2021, the company had raised $4 million in a pre-Series A round led by 3one4 Capital with participation from existing investors Omnivore and Wavemaker Partners.Other investors in this round include Genting Ventures (Malaysia), The Yield Lab Asia-Pacific, Antares Investments, and Sandeep Singhal of Nexus.Founded in 2018 by  Tiwari and Ananda Verma, Fasal works towards making horticulture farming guesswork-free with irrigation alerts, farm-level forecasts, and pest and disease forewarnings, through its patented IoT (Internet of Things) system called Kranti. Today, Fasal works with Indian farmers over 60,000 acres across more than 20 crops, who are leveraging this technology, it said.Tiwari believes Fasal Fresh differentiates itself from other players as it sells produce, grown on farmlands that use Fasal's precision agriculture tech. “What is coming out from here is grown sustainability. You could potentially look at us as an integrated player, we won't sell off random produce bought from anywhere to anybody,” he said.Fasal also plans to launch its input business soon to provide full-stack services to its farmers.Tiwari said the company largely deals in high-value, high-risk, high-reward crops, at the moment.“This includes things that we consume on a daily basis and pay at least Rs 100 per kg for them. For example, apples from Shimla, grapes from Nasik, chili and capsicums from southern MP, and so on.

Ex-Nazara CEO Manish Agarwal's Web3 gaming firm raises $20M funding; acquires IndiGG,23 February,"Former Nazara Technologies CEO Manish Agarwal is partnering with angel investor Ishank Gupta to launch Kratos Studios, a Web3 gaming venture that has raised Rs 160 crore ($20 million) financing, marking a significant seed investment amidst a digital asset downturn led by crypto rout and the country's prolonged funding slowdown.The fundraise was led by Accel, with participation from investors such as Prosus Ventures, Courtside Ventures, Nexus Venture Partners, and Nazara Technologies, among others.The token round values the company at Rs 1,200 crore ($150 million) on a fully diluted basis. In token rounds, investors back a startup by directly buying tokens of the company instead of taking equity in the firm.The company plans to use the funds raised to build the distribution rails in emerging markets for global Web3 games apart from investing in ""most promising"" Web3 games across the world.IndiGG acquisitionIn addition to the fundraise, Kratos Studios also announced that it has completed the acquisition of Polygon Labs-backed IndiGG through token swap, and that the company plans to operate its Web3 gaming operations under the IndiGG brand.IndiGG's existing INDI tokens will be swapped with the new tokens once the company releases them for the general public (known as Token Generation Event) in the next 12 months, Agarwal told Moneycontrol. Until then, the INDI token will continue to trade on existing exchanges.""We want to have a single source of value creation. Our view is that if the community creates value, then only investors, founders and the team will get value. We didn't want to create any structure where the community is not partaking. So, even the founders don't own equity,"" Agarwal said.IndiGG is an India-focused sub-decentralised autonomous organisation (subDAO) of the Philippine play-to-earn gaming guild Yield Guild Games (YGG), which was built in partnership with Polygon Labs.Decentralised autonomous organisation (DAO) is a kind of business structure where the control is spread out across a community with no central authority, thereby eliminating the need for traditional organisational hierarchies.IndiGG raised $6 million in seed funding from investors such as Sequoia India, Lightspeed Venture Partners, and Animoca Brands in January 2022. Agarwal, who was at Nazara Technologies at the time, had also participated in the funding round as an angel investor.In a statement, the startup said both its co-founders will continue to work closely with Polygon’s co-founder Sandeep Nailwal and Yield Guild Games (YGG)’s co-founder Gabby Dizon as it aims to build the largest gaming DAO in the world.Focus on product-market fit before token launchAgarwal said that they do not want to rush the launch of the new token without first establishing product-market fit and tokenomics.""The launch of the token is purely a function of three things - the consumer traction on the platform, when we are able to see the economics of supply and demand of the token, and our handle on levers to control inflation and deflation,"" he said.Agarwal added ""We are here for a marathon. I have always built businesses which have a brick by brick foundation, so that you can have scalable, sustainable, profitable business models. That may come across as a non-Web3 topic since Web3 people don't usually talk about revenue or profits.""""We are providing the 500M+ South Asian gamers an opportunity to leverage their time and skill to become creators of digital goods on the blockchain for global games.

Unitus Ventures makes first close of Rs 75 crore in Rs 300-crore new fund,09 February,"Unitus Ventures, an early-stage venture capital (VC) firm, on February 9 said it has made the first close of Rs 75 crore towards its first ‘opportunity fund’. With the new fund, Unitus plans to make follow-on investments in well-performing portfolio companies, at a time when growth and late-stage funding rounds have decreased amid a prolonged funding winter.In a statement, the company said the amount raised will be used to back breakout companies from Unitus’ portfolio of 39 companies funded from its two early-stage funds -  Unitus Ventures Fund I and Unitus Ventures Fund II.Marquee investors such as the Mynavi Corporation of Japan, BVR Mohan Reddy of Cyient, and Nandkumar Seksaria of Govindram Seksaria Group among others have backed the first close of the fund.Founded in September 2012 by Dave Richards, Will Poole, and Srikrishna Ramamoorthy, Unitus Ventures closed its first fund in 2013 at Rs 140 crore and invested in sectors including healthcare, education, technology, and e-commerce.“Looking back at our journey, we are pleased to see how these businesses have grown and are now attracting substantial capital from marquee investors including Sequoia, BII (formerly CDC), Microsoft M12, and Google’s CapitalG. Today, they are trailblazers in sustainable value creation, global expansion, and delivering steady returns, even during turbulent times,” said Poole, who is also the managing partner of Unitus Ventures.The VC firm said it plans to double down on startups across jobtech, fintech, edtech, and artificial intelligence based on their performance so far. Unitus said it plans to invest the new fund, targeted to have a final close of Rs 300 crore, starting with five companies including BetterPlace, Cuemath, Awign, Masai, and Eduvanz.Also Read: ITC veteran Sanjiv Rangrass joins early-stage VC firm Unitus as venture partnerSurya Mantha, who is also a managing partner at Unitus Ventures, said that despite the tough macroeconomic environment, most of Unitus' portfolio companies have grown sustainably because of their strong unit economics and focus on profitability.“Up to 20 percent of the Opportunity Fund’s capital will be available for promising deals outside of Unitus’ existing portfolio. This will enable us to explore opportunities in early-growth or growth-stage companies that are capitalizing on advances in Generative AI and Climate technologies,” added Mantha.Cyient’s Reddy, who is one of Unitus’s backers in the round, said he decided to invest in Unitus as outcome-oriented education and jobtech are at the core of its investment strategy.“I liked Unitus’ investment thesis. Educating our youth and preparing them for the rapidly evolving job market is probably the single biggest challenge and opportunity for India in the next decade,” said Cyient’s Reddy.“Mynavi’s mission is to help shape the future by engaging individual potential in all walks and at all stages of life.

Funding to Indian startups sinks to a 5-year-low in January as funding winter worsens,02 February,"Private equity and venture capital (PE/VC) funding to Indian startups slumped to a 63-month low in January amid rising macroeconomic uncertainties, a trend that could continue for at least the first of 2023.Indian startups raised $630 million in January from PE/VC investors across 121 deals, the lowest by value since September 2017, according to data shared by Venture Intelligence with Moneycontrol. In September 2017, startups raised $148.3 million across 39 deals, the data showed.Investors have been going slow in funding high-growth ventures amid uncertainties caused by accelerating inflation, rising global interest rates, the specter of recession confronting the West, and the war in Europe that has disrupted supply chains.Industry observers expect the slowdown to continue, at least in the near term, as investors wait for valuations to rationalise.“The first half will be tough for all (global) startups in general and not just Indian. The reason is the tentativeness in funds to invest because of global uncertainties. It is indeed a function of startups needing more time to grow to justify the valuations at which it will be prudent for startups to raise funds,” said Ashish Kumar, co-founder and general partner at Nandan Nilekani’s Fundamentum Partnership.Tough year aheadTo put things in perspective, startups were raising $2 billion monthly on average in 2022 and $3 billion in 2021, according to the Venture Intelligence data.In January 2022, startups raised close to $4.1 billion across 136 deals, the data showed. Even in the second half of 2022, when investors started pulling out of deals because of the worsening macroeconomic environment, startups were raising close to $1 billion monthly on average, the data showed.In January, PE/VC funding to India’s startup ecosystem, currently the third-largest in the world, also dropped more than it did in the US and China, the world’s two biggest startup ecosystems.“I think 2023 will be tough in general, I can't say what region will be relatively better but I feel the correlation will be strong globally. So recovery will happen together in terms of funding in startups,” Kumar of Fundamentum added.He also said that he expects the second half of the calendar year to be “much better.”LayoffsIndia’s startups are already scrambling to survive the funding winter. At least 15 startups, including the most-funded unicorns, let go of close to 2,700 employees in January alone, taking the total tally of layoffs to more than 20,000 since the start of 2022.The most bullish investors have gone slow in investing. According to data compiled by Moneycontrol, Tiger Global, and Sequoia Capital, two of the country’s most aggressive startup investors, who have backed 38 and 31 of India’s 107 unicorns, did not participate in a single funding round in January. Interestingly, Sequoia Capital India raised a $2.85 billion fund last year, while Tiger Global is raising a $6 billion fund, of which India is expected to be among the biggest beneficiaries. Not just Sequoia and Tiger, other aggressive VC investors including Accel, Elevation Partners, and Matrix Partners, among others, have also raised large India-dedicated funds.According to data compiled by Moneycontrol, VC firms have raised close to $10 billion for Indian startups since the start of 2022.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/startup/funding-to-indian-startups-sinks-to-a-5-year-low-in-january-as-funding-winter-worsens-9988271.html,Funding,"In September 2017, startups raised $148.3 million across 39 deals, the data showed.Investors have been going slow in funding high-growth ventures amid uncertainties caused by accelerating inflation, rising global interest rates, the specter of recession confronting the West, and the war in Europe that has disrupted supply chains.Industry observers expect the slowdown to continue, at least in the near term, as investors wait for valuations to rationalise.“The first half will be tough for all (global) startups in general and not just Indian.Even in the second half of 2022, when investors started pulling out of deals because of the worsening macroeconomic environment, startups were raising close to $1 billion monthly on average, the data showed.In January, PE/VC funding to India’s startup ecosystem, currently the third-largest in the world, also dropped more than it did in the US and China, the world’s two biggest startup ecosystems.“I think 2023 will be tough in general, I can't say what region will be relatively better but I feel the correlation will be strong globally.",['PE/VC'],"['$630 million', '$148.3 million', '$2 billion', '$3 billion', 'close to $4.1 billion', 'close to $1 billion', '$2.85 billion', '$6 billion', 'close to $10 billion']"
"MY BUDGET | Tax exemptions, ease of FDI, lesser regulatory burden: What startups want",26 January,"Startups in India are now starting to feel the pinch. The earlier movers had access to seemingly bottomless piles of money, leading to sky-high valuations  But the funding tap has since been turned off, dropping 33 percent on-year in 2022, as per a PwC India report released on January 16.While the government has several programmes to help startups with funding, those new to the business are seeking wider fiscal support, incentives, and tax relaxations as rising inflation and interest rates pose a big challenge.To be sure, India’s startup economy has mushroomed, aided by the government’s ‘Startup India’ programme launched in 2015. The Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) also created the Startup India Seed Fund Scheme with an outlay of Rs 945 crore to provide financial assistance to startups for proof of concept, prototype development, product trials, market-entry, and commercialisation. As per the government, the scheme will support an estimated 3,600 entrepreneurs through 300 incubators over four years.Vikas Jain, co-founder of Multipl, an online money management firm registered with the initiative, said that while there are tax exemptions for registered startups as well as grants available for very early-stage startups, the amounts are insignificant.“We were eligible for it but did not avail it as the amounts given are too nominal and we were already bootstrapped by the three of us co-founders,” Jain said.India is home to over 100 unicorn startups and 80,000 DPIIT-recognised startups. Other government schemes such as the Fund of Funds for Startups Scheme, the Credit Guarantee Scheme for Startups, and Support for Intellectual Property Protection seek to boost the ecosystem further.Still, young startups conceived and operationalised during the tough pandemic years are finding it tough to navigate. Some complain about high taxation, which adds to the burden of high interest rates and inflation.“The government should reduce GST (goods and services tax) for startups for their first five years in their incubation period. This way, we can thrive and sustain, showcase our products in competitive scenarios,” said Mahendra Kapadi, founder, 1Beginner Systems, a venture launched in 2021 with two productivity products. The startup, still in its early stages, plans to launch three more products soon.“We hope that the finance minister will provide incentives and tax exemptions to institutional funds and individuals investing in startups across sectors such as agritech, edtech and fintech,” said Jain of Multipl. “They should also give serious thought to the idea of the government providing grants and funding to startups for their growth stages.""Startups also argue that there is a need to incentivise greater investment by providing incentives and tax exemptions to institutional and individual investors.“We hope the government extends the startup tax holiday by one more financial year till April 2023,” said Mehul Jindal, CEO, and co-founder of BharatX, a fintech company launched in 2019.“Ease of FDI (foreign direct investment) into India for startups should be looked into. Tax relaxation for startup employees would help us by leaps and bounds,” Jindal added.Expanding on issues faced by those running product-based startups, 1Beginner Systems’ Kapadi pointed out that the GST enforces high taxes, shrinking margins for startups that are still making up for the losses suffered during the pandemic.Other ideas include a common platform for collaboration to help newer startups with planning, research and development, apart from validating new ideas.“There is still a remarkable difference between the quality of services that are accessible to the elite population and those that are available to the masses. The government can correct this situation by encouraging greater use of technology and by reducing the regulatory burden on various startups,” said Jain of Multipl.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/budget/my-budget-tax-exemptions-ease-of-fdi-lesser-regulatory-burden-what-startups-want-9943021.html,Funding,"As per the government, the scheme will support an estimated 3,600 entrepreneurs through 300 incubators over four years.Vikas Jain, co-founder of Multipl, an online money management firm registered with the initiative, said that while there are tax exemptions for registered startups as well as grants available for very early-stage startups, the amounts are insignificant.“We were eligible for it but did not avail it as the amounts given are too nominal and we were already bootstrapped by the three of us co-founders,” Jain said.India is home to over 100 unicorn startups and 80,000 DPIIT-recognised startups.Tax relaxation for startup employees would help us by leaps and bounds,” Jindal added.Expanding on issues faced by those running product-based startups, 1Beginner Systems’ Kapadi pointed out that the GST enforces high taxes, shrinking margins for startups that are still making up for the losses suffered during the pandemic.Other ideas include a common platform for collaboration to help newer startups with planning, research and development, apart from validating new ideas.“There is still a remarkable difference between the quality of services that are accessible to the elite population and those that are available to the masses.","['1Beginner Systems', 'GST']",[]

"Luxury home developer Isprava raises Rs 160 crore, to expand India, overseas business",19 January,"The Isprava Group, a luxury home developer focused on non-urban areas, has raised Rs 160 crore in a funding round led by London Stock Exchange-listed Symphony International Holdings Limited, the company said on January 19.Isprava and its hospitality business Lohono Stays would utilise the funds to expand their footprint in India and other countries. They would look at technology and product development, the company said.“The reason why we have raised the amount is not because there is a requirement for the money but because they are the right partners for us,” Isprava Group co-founder and CEO Nibhrant Shah said told Moneycontrol.The company raised a round last year. The focus of the first round of funding was majorly at the project level and that financing was for land acquisition, Shah said.“This amount is for a more strategic purpose such as acquisition and inorganic growth. Our focus will also be on technology and product development,” he said.Founded by Nibhrant, Dhimaan Shah and Rohan Lamba, Isprava in six years has delivered over 160 homes with an additional 270 homes under various stages of construction in places such as Goa, Alibaug, Kasauli and the Nilgiris.Lohono Stays is into luxury rental homestay market.

PhonePe raises $350 million from General Atlantic at a valuation of $12 billion,19 January,"Payments and financial services unicorn PhonePe has raised $350 million in a new funding round from General Atlantic at a valuation of over $12 billion, making the Walmart-backed startup, the most-valued fintech in India. The company would be raising as much as $1 billion in the current round in tranches, it said in a statement on January 19.Moneycontrol first reported in October about PhonePe eyeing a fundraise from General Atlantic at a valuation of $12 billion.PhonePe’s fundraise follows the company’s spin-off from e-commerce startup Flipkart, which was announced in December. The Flipkart spin-off also completes PhonePe's transition to a fully Indian-domiciled company, which began in 2022.PhonePe has now become a decacorn, or a startup valued at more than $10 billion, joining the ranks of Flipkart, which was acquired by Walmart, Paytm, which went public last year, Byju's, and Swiggy. PhonePe's valuation has also surpassed that of Razorpay, a digital payments and neobanking unicorn that was last valued at around $7.5 billion.PhonePe will be using the funds for making investments into infrastructure, including the development of data centers, the company said in a statement on January 19.The company also plans to invest in new businesses, including insurance, wealth management, and lending. PhonePe will also focus on UPI lite and credit on UPI, the company said.The new fundraise is a rare instance of a late-stage round in the midst of a startup funding winter in which investors are writing smaller cheques as the macro environment deteriorates. When Flipkart spun off PhonePe into a separate entity, it was valued at $5.5 billion. Flipkart had put in $700 million at the time.PhonePe's fundraise comes at a time when its closest competitor, Paytm, has seen its valuation drop by over 60 percent since it went public in November 2021, prompting public shareholders to question the company's ability to attain company-level profitability. Paytm's total market capitalisation was just over $4.3 billion as of January 19.But, Paytm’s revenue is much higher than that of PhonePe. As of FY22, Paytm had a revenue of Rs 3,892.40 crore, while PhonePe had a revenue of Rs 1,646 crore. Moreover, PhonePe reported a loss of Rs 2,014 crore in FY22 (2021-22), which widened from Rs 1,729 crore in FY21 (2020-21). Paytm, meanwhile, reported a net loss of Rs 2,325 crore for FY22, which widened from Rs 1,560 crore in FY21.PhonePe's fundraising comes at a particularly challenging time for fintech companies in India, as the Reserve Bank of India (RBI)  has come down heavily on the sector, affecting businesses across the board.Moreover, valuations of financial services and technology companies have dropped significantly this year, as part of a broader correction in global financial markets caused by macroeconomic uncertainties.

"Edtech startup Toddle raises $17 million from Sequoia Capital India, others ",10 January,"Edtech SaaS (software as a service) startup Toddle on January 10 said it has raised $17 million led by Sequoia Capital India in its series A round that saw participation from Tenacity Ventures and Trifecta Capital along with existing investors Matrix Partners, Beenext, and Better Capital.This comes as B2C (business-to-customer) K12 (kindergarten through standard 12) online edtech startups in India have been suffering post-pandemic with demand falling, while those operating in the B2B (business-to-business) edtech segment witnessed tailwinds of growth with schools more open to adopting innovation.“A significant part of this (the fund raised) would be used in product development and furthering the growth initiative. So far, we have focused on content, design, and community initiatives. Going forward, we intend to double down on that as well as start experimenting with go-to-market efforts,” said Deepanshu Arora, co-founder and chief executive officer (CEO) of Toddle, in a virtual interaction with Moneycontrol.Arora also said the company plans to hire for 70 to 80 positions in the next four to five months. “Few senior roles are critical for us like a VP (vice president) of marketing, VP of sales, Head of people, to build a leadership team,” he said. The company, however, did not disclose details on its valuation post the funding round.Founded in 2019 by a team of educators Arora, Gautam Arora, Misbah Jafary, Nikhil Poonawala, and Parita Parekh, Toddle is an edtech SaaS startup. The startup’s first product is a teaching and learning platform used by independent schools offering IB (International Baccalaureate) and other progressive curricula, it said.“We are really focused on the absolute top echelons of the school ecosystem and therefore, we feel, this is an all-weather business,” Arora said.The company has recently expanded its product offering to other international curricula such as Cambridge, British, and American, and will soon be launching a product for preschools, it said.The Toddle platform is currently used by over 40,000 educators from more than 1,500 schools, which includes both free and paid customers, in over 100 countries, the company added. Today, Toddle is operating in countries like the US, UK, Australia, China, and the UAE.Arora said the company has had a global outlook from day one. “About 40 percent of our revenues come from North and South America combined, about 30 percent comes from Europe and the Middle East, and the rest comes from the Asia Pacific. Within that India is about seven to eight percent of our revenue,” he said.“The Toddle founders’ passion for education is palpable and has grown on us in the several years that we have known them. They have poured this passion into building a product that is widely loved by educators around the world.

"Agritech startup Cropin raises $14 million from Google, JSR Corp, others ",09 January,"Chiratae Ventures-backed agritech startup Cropin today said it raised Rs 113 crore (approximately $14 million) in funding from Google and JSR Corporation in a round that saw participation from its existing investors.This comes at a time when the agritech sector has seen funding pouring in on the back of investors' optimism in the nascent sector’s potential to grow on rising demand for quality food post-pandemic, supported by macro tailwinds like climate change and food security concerns.“We will use most of the funds for the international expansions that we are doing like we recently entered into the United States and Europe. So we are going deep into those markets. We will sit closer with the customer because we want to go deep with them, expand with them as well,” said Krishna Kumar, co-founder and chief executive officer (CEO) of Cropin.Kumar also told Moneycontrol the company will also be investing more in the Cropin AI (Artificial Intelligence) platform and building upon what was made in the last 10 years, accelerating the pace of innovation.

PE/VC funding tanked 30% in 2022; here's how Indian startups fared this year,31 December,"The funds coming into Indian startups through the private equity (PE) and venture capital (VC) route slowed a little over 32 percent by value in 2022, as the ecosystem witnessed a prolonged effect of the funding winter.PE/VC funds made 1,130 bets on startups worth $23.95 billion in 2022, while last year, thanks to funds pouring into the ecosystem during 2021’s funding frenzy, private market investors had made 1,215 bets worth $35.46 billion, the data showed.After the initial few months of 2022, with the pandemic receding and inflation rising, central banks had been rolling back excess liquidity from the banking system and raising rates to tame inflation, resulting in money becoming expensive. Investors (both private and public market) have thus cut back on their investments this year.According to the data shared by Venture Intelligence, December recorded the lowest funding to startups in the last two years. Indian startups raised $799 million in 54 deals this month, a drop of over 30 percent month on month from $1,149 million in 69 deals recorded last month.Deal sizesMoneycontrol had reported earlier how the funding winter has also led to investors making smaller-sized bets, especially at late-stage deals.According to updated data by Venture Intelligence, the average deal size of late-stage transactions (investment into companies that are over 10 years old, or Series G or later rounds of institutional investments) fell 39 percent to $90 million in 2022 from $148 million last year.Total investments in late-stage deals also almost halved to $6,584 million in 2022 from $12,297 million last year.However, early-and-growth-stage deal sizes have gone up in 2022 versus 2021. The average cheque sizes of growth stage deals (Series C and Series D) have gone up to $7.9 million this year from $6.9 million last year. Early-stage deal sizes, meanwhile, have gone up to $4 million on average in 2022 from $3.4 million in 2021.Top deals in 2022Among startups in 2022, VerSe Innovation which runs the news aggregator platform DailyHunt, raised $805 million from Luxor Capital, Ontario Teachers Pension Plan, Sofina, Baillie Gifford, CPPIB (Canada Pension Plan Investment Board). Following it, the next big deal was worth $700 million, when Baron Capital and Prosus Ventures led a round in Swiggy.In 2021, Flipkart had raised $3.6 billion from a clutch of investors including Antara Capital, Tencent, Qatar Investment Authority, CPPIB, SoftBank Corp, Franklin Templeton PE, Tiger Global, and GIC among others, in what was 2021’s largest PE/VC deal.Most active VC investors Sequoia Capital has retained its position as the most-active investor by the number of deals in 2022. However, this year, Sequoia Capital has made 73 deals versus 110 in 2021, a fall of about 34 percent year-on-year.Interestingly, Better Capital boosted deals this year making 57 investments compared to a low three last year.

SaaS in 2023: Founders and investors spot emerging themes amid recession fears,30 December,"2022 started on a positive note for the booming domestic Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) ecosystem in India and globally. The Indian SaaS startups raised more than $5 billion this year, according to data research and analysis firm Venture Intelligence.Rewind 2022Mega fundraising deals like Uniphore’s $400 million and Chargebee’s $250 million at the start of the year made investors, founders and other SaaS stakeholders upbeat about the sector. In 2022, India also minted unicorns like Fractal, DarwinBox, Uniphore, Leadsquared.However, SaaS firms started to feel the heat of slow demand growth in the second half of the year.The Russia-Ukraine war and its impact on supply chains, runaway inflation and the US Federal Reserve’s aggressive interest rate hikes led to fears of a recession in the US. Experts are concerned this may lead to lower spending on software, which would be a dampener for SaaS companies.Top SaaS firms including Salesforce, Freshworks, and Chargebee announced layoffs while other firms resorted to stringent cost-cutting measures like freezing hiring or reducing marketing spends.""Predicting what will work in 2023 is difficult Even a large firm like Salesforce, for the first time since its inception, did not provide a 2023 forecast, saying “Things are too unpredictable to provide a forecast,"" said Prasanna Krishnamoorthy, founder of VC firm Upekkha.However, there are general themes and exciting sectors that may take off in 2023.What’s in store for the SaaS ecosystem in 2023?While several Investors and founders Moneycontrol spoke to said that the year 2023 is going to be rough for many due to the likelihood of a recession, themes such as generative AI, Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) offerings, and Low Code/No Code (LC/NC) platforms cloud security-based software will see more adoption next year.Predictive AI will be the biggest bet“I think every company will have to build a predictive as well as embedded AI experience into their platforms and it is going to become table stakes through 2023,” said Krish Subramanian, Co-Founder & CEO, Chargebee.Founders believe that the ideas that originated in predictive AI technology which found use-cases in HRTech, ChatBots including climate change analysis will start getting the attention of many investors.“AI will continue to hold a strong ground. Businesses are realising the operational excellence, decision intelligence, and overall value addition that robust AI capabilities can bring to the table. In 2023, CXOs are likely to increase their AI investments to improve their CX and EX,” said Praval Singh, VP - Marketing & Customer Experience, Zoho Corp.DeepTech will continue to be a favourite betWith many top SaaS firms betting big on DeepTech and doubling down investments, the segment is poised to grow further.“Any products especially in the DeepTech category that are built to improve operational efficiencies, cut down costs and directly improve bottom lines/revenues will do well,” said Prabhu Ramachandran, Founder and CEO of Facilio Inc.“The focus is always on building products from the ground up instead of acquiring them, and investing heavily in R&D to gain the know-how and develop deep-tech capabilities like audio-video conferencing and AI frameworks,” said Zoho’s Singh.Cloud infra, data security and developer tools will grow bigCybersecurity is transitioning to a board-level imperative and is now a non-negotiable capability for every organisation, private or governmental.“Cybersecurity is a critical national security risk for every country and cyber warfare capabilities will increasingly determine outcomes in military conflicts. The recent breach at AIIMS should serve as a wake-up call,” said T.N. Hari, Co-Founder of Artha School of Entrepreneurship.A tiny security or privacy lapse can topple even the biggest brands.“Data privacy and protection will remain critical and see a larger degree of technology investment. This may also push larger companies, especially in certain sectors, to consider on-premises cloud setups in order to retain more control over the software they deploy and their data,” said Zoho’s Singh.More and more businesses are moving towards cloud, said Manav Garg, founding partner at Together Fund and Co-Founder of Eka Software Solutions.“Cloud Infrastructure and developer tools are going to be big themes in 2023. India has more than five million developers and this market is going to go big from India to global companies,” Garg added.He said India will see a lot of regulation coming around data privacy, security, and cloud infrastructure, which will shape how businesses in these segments will grow.SaaS is getting commodifiedSaaS and software are getting commodified, said Mohan Kumar, Managing Partner, Avataar Ventures.“While that may not have been true ten years ago, today, it increasingly is…In this setup, SaaS companies should make sure the product features are of absolutely low- cost but still make money out of it. If SaaS companies cannot acquire customers without massive marketing spending then that means there is no market for that product. They have to be very efficient in acquiring customers,” Kumar said.Companies which are still figuring out product market fit and haven’t raised yet will find it difficult, this is the biggest learning from our business too, said Facilio’s Ramachandran.The SaaS ecosystem may see consolidation Interestingly, lots of Sales and CRM related tools eg pre Sales / Sales enablement and different ""slivers"" are becoming a very competitive space, said Sanjay Nath, cofounder, Blume Ventures.""Unless these products are able to differentiate themselves, there will be consolidation and a sharp narrowing of vendors. Security, storage, data privacy, compliance (""Reg Tech"") on the other hand, are must-haves but again differentiation is key,"" Nath added.Together Fund's Garg said that companies’ net retention ratio (NRR) may grow slowly or may not grow at all in 2023 and if enterprise SaaS is targeting only SMB businesses, which are more prone to shut down or have financial issues in scaling up.Due to this many smaller organisations may not sustain in the market. However, their products still make sense for bigger firms. This will eventually result in industry-wide consolidation of SaaS as small-scale businesses will be absorbed by bigger companies. While there have been fewer acquisitions, investors say that there may be more in 2023.Consolidation will be driven from the customer end as well. As more businesses start up directly or shift their entire operations to the cloud, demand will increase for consolidated—i.e, unified—online platforms.Companies may go all the way to improve efficiencies“The numbers like unit economics, churn and SaaS magic numbers which will determine sales efficiency will take centre stage,” Kissflow’s founder and CEO, Suresh Sambandam told Moneycontrol.Efficient growth is definitely going to be big and a very different breed of companies that will survive through this will emerge stronger,” added Chargebee’s Subramanian.“SaaS companies selling their products to other SaaS companies may see a hit in their businesses. They are very vertical focused and there is no scope for hedging,” he added.“Earlier companies started and were structured only for growth, now companies should balance between growth and profit,” Garg of Together Fund added.Light at the end of the tunnel in 2023Investors said that while the early stage may remain active in terms of deals, the late stage will go through massive challenges.""We have all seen that valuations are extremely volatile and unfortunately mean little on the ground. Founders should monitor their LTV to CAC and keep improving it to show a healthy business,"" said Bhanu Chopra, Founder, and Chairman, RateGain Travel Technologies.“The incentive for someone to start a business is growing, and pre-seed and seed stage investors are still enthusiastic. Maybe not be as active as in 2021 but will be similar to 2022. However, the late stage will go through massive challenges because of the valuation gap. And the IPO market looks very bleak too,” said Manav Garg of Together Fund.However, founders feel that the recession is helping in some ways and aiding many SaaS firms to grow stronger.“Exorbitant valuations have come down. 2021 and 2022 saw some frenzy valuations like 40X and 30X, I think that will change. An ideal number can be in the range of 10X to 20X,” said Kissflow’s Sambandam.“The recession is a good thing in a way because talent is available at an affordable cost, especially in the US. After the great resignation hiring cost went up very high. And it is very affordable,” he added.""Controlling burn, retaining customers, and growth with a view to profitability are all becoming key survival factors for 2023. And as I indicated above, managing and meeting key metrics such as NDR (net dollar retention), NNR (net new revenue), payback period (sales efficiency) will be key,"" added Nath of Blume Ventures.Valuations in 2023 will be realistic and straight-cut.Avataar Fund is very bullish on vertical SaaS, consumer SaaS and banking SaaS, said Mohan Kumar.“I think a lot of us will build up muscle through 2023. And that means the companies that survived this particular phase over the next 18-24 months will have an opportunity to build those long-lasting companies,” said Chargebee’s Subramanian.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/startup/saas-in-2023-founders-and-investors-spot-emerging-themes-amid-recession-fears-9787911.html,Funding,"""Predicting what will work in 2023 is difficult Even a large firm like Salesforce, for the first time since its inception, did not provide a 2023 forecast, saying “Things are too unpredictable to provide a forecast,"" said Prasanna Krishnamoorthy, founder of VC firm Upekkha.However, there are general themes and exciting sectors that may take off in 2023.What’s in store for the SaaS ecosystem in 2023?While several Investors and founders Moneycontrol spoke to said that the year 2023 is going to be rough for many due to the likelihood of a recession, themes such as generative AI, Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) offerings, and Low Code/No Code (LC/NC) platforms cloud security-based software will see more adoption next year.Predictive AI will be the biggest bet“I think every company will have to build a predictive as well as embedded AI experience into their platforms and it is going to become table stakes through 2023,” said Krish Subramanian, Co-Founder & CEO, Chargebee.Founders believe that the ideas that originated in predictive AI technology which found use-cases in HRTech, ChatBots including climate change analysis will start getting the attention of many investors.“AI will continue to hold a strong ground.In 2023, CXOs are likely to increase their AI investments to improve their CX and EX,” said Praval Singh, VP - Marketing & Customer Experience, Zoho Corp.DeepTech will continue to be a favourite betWith many top SaaS firms betting big on DeepTech and doubling down investments, the segment is poised to grow further.“Any products especially in the DeepTech category that are built to improve operational efficiencies, cut down costs and directly improve bottom lines/revenues will do well,” said Prabhu Ramachandran, Founder and CEO of Facilio Inc.“The focus is always on building products from the ground up instead of acquiring them, and investing heavily in R&D to gain the know-how and develop deep-tech capabilities like audio-video conferencing and AI frameworks,” said Zoho’s Singh.Cloud infra, data security and developer tools will grow bigCybersecurity is transitioning to a board-level imperative and is now a non-negotiable capability for every organisation, private or governmental.“Cybersecurity is a critical national security risk for every country and cyber warfare capabilities will increasingly determine outcomes in military conflicts.","['Moneycontrol', 'AI', 'AI', 'Krish Subramanian,', 'Co-Founder & CEO', 'AI', 'HRTech', 'AI', 'CX', 'EX', 'VP - Marketing & Customer', 'Zoho Corp.', 'DeepTech', 'DeepTech', 'DeepTech', 'Founder', 'Facilio Inc.', 'AI', 'bigCybersecurity']","['more than $5 billion', '$400 million', '$250 million']"
Goodbye 2022 | India’s Agritech sector in full bloom as valuations shoot up amid continued investor interest,26 December,"In 2021, Rocketship.vc, a Silicon Valley-based venture capital (VC) firm backed the Indian agritech startup Animall, a managed marketplace for cattle trading.Madhu Shalini Iyer, a partner at the firm, said it was their first bet into the sector. The firm decided to invest in Animall after recognising its need and potential in an enormous agrarian market like India, she added.However, over the last six to eight months, Iyer said the VC firm, which leverages data science and analytics to make investment decisions, has started to witness agritech pop up in their algorithms compelling the firm to look even closer into the sector.“We are currently evaluating three to four agritech deals as we speak, that should tell you how much has changed for agritech,” Iyer told Moneycontrol in an interaction when she flew down to Mumbai recently.Rocketship and Iyer’s bullishness towards agritech – a sector that was once left untouched by global investors, is echoed by many venture capitalists and industry experts who are intrigued by the sector’s growth over the last two years. Investors such as General Catalysts, Tiger Global, Sequoia Capital, and Alpha Wave Global, among others have taken cognisance of the sector.Moneycontrol had earlier reported how investors' optimism in the nascent sector’s potential to grow on rising demand for quality food, supported by macro tailwinds like climate change and food security concerns triggered renewed interest in agritech in 2022.Bucking the trendThis year, with private equity and venture capital investors shifting focus towards profitability, biggies in sectors like edtech, ecommerce and fintech – the poster boys of 2021’s startup bash, had to take a step back to re-evaluate their strategies and align themselves to the fundamentals.Meanwhile, for the agritech ecosystem that witnessed valuations shooting up and continued funding with unwavering investor interest, there seems to be no end to the party.As the year draws to a close, Moneycontrol took a look back at how the Indian agritech landscape entered a new chapter of growth in 2022 – a year that witnessed an overall lesser deployment of funds into startups even as many VC firms raised large India-focused funds amounting to over $7.8 billion in dry powder.Investors keep givingIn October, Moneycontrol reported that Indian agritech startups raised $296 million across 27 private equity and venture capital deals in the first half of this financial year, almost double the $157 million through 23 deals during the same period in FY22.According to updated data by Venture intelligence, Agritech startups raised a total of $515 million in 49 deals in 2022, a spike of over three times from $161 million raised by agritech startups in 2020 showing how investments in the sector are above the pre-pandemic levels.Another report by food and agritech-focused venture capital firms, AgFunder and Omnivore, released recently, said the Indian agri-foodtech startups had overtaken China as Asia-Pacific's biggest funder of agrifood-tech innovation.Funding winter effectHowever, agritech was not completely unfazed by the perils of the funding winter that hit the ecosystem this year.This year while the deal count was about 50 deals similar to last year's, the funding amount went down to $515 million from $859 million in 2021 depicting how there was a fall in large cheque sizes in 2022, according to data shared by venture intelligence.Industry experts believe agritech founders who entered the market with last year’s mindset set themselves up for disappointment in an ecosystem that was witnessing an acute fall in late-stage deals and valuations going down.“There are a couple of players that had to downsize either their round or the valuations on the tech side in agriculture,” said a source in the know, requesting anonymity.Full-stack agritech startup DeHaat was expected to raise its latest funding round at a valuation of over $1 billion becoming India’s first agritech unicorn, sources have confirmed. However, the company ended up with a valuation of $695 million post its series E funding which was announced in its entirety at the beginning of December.The source quoted above said that some agritech startups are witnessing speed bumps because the sector, which offers thin margins, is tough to navigate without capital efficiency and good unit economics.“It's not like a consumer industry where we can actually spend some money to get the loyalty of the customers and establish a brand and get to profitability later,” they said.The source added, “You may not be profitable at the EBITDA level, but at least your unit economies with respect to a per transaction on a variable cost basis are very important in agritech.” EBITDA stands for earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortisation.Also Read: Feast to famine: How agritech Dehaat went from record funding to layoffsMaturity in the sectorHowever, experts believe such instances to be just blips for the sector that otherwise poses a promising outlook for the coming years.According to a recent report by investment banking firm Avendus Capital, the agritech sector is expected to create around eight to 10 unicorns in the next five years. As of date, the Indian agritech sector has not minted any unicorns. A unicorn is a startup valued at over $1 billion.The report, which covered startups such as Absolute Foods, Arya.Ag, Dehaat, Farmart, and Bighaat, added that the initial public offering timelines for many agritech ventures are also three to five years away, which can be met with the precursor of active investments.Pankaj Naik, executive director, and co-head of Digital and Technology Investment Banking at Avendus believes the sector has come off the curve as it has passed the early-stage phase, with product market fit and expectations on good unit economics established.“Earlier, some of these new phase startups were very small with a GMV (gross market value) of about $50 million. Now, it's almost $180-200 million and they have pretty good gross margins of 10-15 percent,” Naik told Moneycontrol.Some choose to stay awayEven so, there are some home-grown venture capital firms which plan to steer clear of any agritech investments in the coming year.Micro VCs, angel networks, and accelerators all want to get into the hottest startups as early as possible. However, Artha, founded by angel investor Anirudh Damani may stay away from agritech, a sector with many eyes on it. Damani said while there are several problems to solve in the sector, he is not big on agritech because it involves a high interface with the government.“The government is the best lender and there is already a system there. Trying to replace it with a startup does not work unless you are inside the system from the very start. I see founders sitting in cities and trying to solve the problems of rural India and I don't think that city mentality will work there,” said Damani.Earlier, the micro VC firm backed agritech startups like Farmerz FZ and SeeTree.What's in store for 2023?As things stand, Avendus’s Naik believes in 2023, startups in the “burn zone” unnecessarily would not receive much investment.He said startups which built their businesses in a capital-efficient way with positive CM1 and CM2 (contribution margin one and two) are seeing a lot of interest that's coming their way. “This is where larger cheque sizes of $50-100 million with better valuations are possible,” he added. Contribution margins refer to revenue after deducting variable costs.“We are seeing some momentum for such startups who will be reached out by the investors now and will take capital next year in February, March, or April based on our fillers, both on the investor side as well as on the company side,” said Naik.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/startup/goodbye-2022-indias-agritech-sector-in-full-bloom-as-valuations-shoot-up-amid-continued-investor-interest-9764971.html,Funding,"Investors such as General Catalysts, Tiger Global, Sequoia Capital, and Alpha Wave Global, among others have taken cognisance of the sector.Moneycontrol had earlier reported how investors' optimism in the nascent sector’s potential to grow on rising demand for quality food, supported by macro tailwinds like climate change and food security concerns triggered renewed interest in agritech in 2022.Bucking the trendThis year, with private equity and venture capital investors shifting focus towards profitability, biggies in sectors like edtech, ecommerce and fintech – the poster boys of 2021’s startup bash, had to take a step back to re-evaluate their strategies and align themselves to the fundamentals.Meanwhile, for the agritech ecosystem that witnessed valuations shooting up and continued funding with unwavering investor interest, there seems to be no end to the party.As the year draws to a close, Moneycontrol took a look back at how the Indian agritech landscape entered a new chapter of growth in 2022 – a year that witnessed an overall lesser deployment of funds into startups even as many VC firms raised large India-focused funds amounting to over $7.8 billion in dry powder.Investors keep givingIn October, Moneycontrol reported that Indian agritech startups raised $296 million across 27 private equity and venture capital deals in the first half of this financial year, almost double the $157 million through 23 deals during the same period in FY22.According to updated data by Venture intelligence, Agritech startups raised a total of $515 million in 49 deals in 2022, a spike of over three times from $161 million raised by agritech startups in 2020 showing how investments in the sector are above the pre-pandemic levels.Another report by food and agritech-focused venture capital firms, AgFunder and Omnivore, released recently, said the Indian agri-foodtech startups had overtaken China as Asia-Pacific's biggest funder of agrifood-tech innovation.Funding winter effectHowever, agritech was not completely unfazed by the perils of the funding winter that hit the ecosystem this year.This year while the deal count was about 50 deals similar to last year's, the funding amount went down to $515 million from $859 million in 2021 depicting how there was a fall in large cheque sizes in 2022, according to data shared by venture intelligence.Industry experts believe agritech founders who entered the market with last year’s mindset set themselves up for disappointment in an ecosystem that was witnessing an acute fall in late-stage deals and valuations going down.“There are a couple of players that had to downsize either their round or the valuations on the tech side in agriculture,” said a source in the know, requesting anonymity.Full-stack agritech startup DeHaat was expected to raise its latest funding round at a valuation of over $1 billion becoming India’s first agritech unicorn, sources have confirmed.However, the company ended up with a valuation of $695 million post its series E funding which was announced in its entirety at the beginning of December.The source quoted above said that some agritech startups are witnessing speed bumps because the sector, which offers thin margins, is tough to navigate without capital efficiency and good unit economics.“It's not like a consumer industry where we can actually spend some money to get the loyalty of the customers and establish a brand and get to profitability later,” they said.The source added, “You may not be profitable at the EBITDA level, but at least your unit economies with respect to a per transaction on a variable cost basis are very important in agritech.” EBITDA stands for earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortisation.Also Read: Feast to famine: How agritech Dehaat went from record funding to layoffsMaturity in the sectorHowever, experts believe such instances to be just blips for the sector that otherwise poses a promising outlook for the coming years.According to a recent report by investment banking firm Avendus Capital, the agritech sector is expected to create around eight to 10 unicorns in the next five years.","['Sequoia Capital',

US Senate advances $1.66 trillion government-funding bill,21 December,"A $1.66 trillion government spending bill drew overwhelming bipartisan support in the U.S. Senate on Tuesday as lawmakers steered it toward passage before a weekend deadline to avoid a partial shutdown of federal agencies.Democratic and Republican negotiators agreed early Tuesday morning on the sweeping bill to fund the federal government through the end of its fiscal year on Sept. 30, raising funding from about $1.5 trillion in the last fiscal year.The Senate voted 70-25 to proceed to debate of the bill, with some Republican senators hoping to offer amendments.A handful of conservative Senate Republicans on Tuesday said they objected to the bill, but would not try to stop its passage.""Under no circumstances are we going to go over the shutdown deadline,"" said Senator Mike Lee, who joined a news conference with four allies to speak out against the measure. Fellow Republican Senator Mike Braun said the group will intensify its budget reform efforts next year, when Republicans take control of the House of Representatives.""We are not going to win this war with theatrics,"" Braun added.The bill includes other measures agreed on by negotiators from both parties, including a ban on the use of TikTok on government-owned devices and clarification of Congress's role in certifying elections, an attempt to avoid a repeat of the violence of Jan. 6, 2021.Senate and House leaders aim to pass the 4,155-page bill and send it to Democratic President Joe Biden for signing by the end of the week to ensure there are no interruptions to the government's activities.The Tuesday vote was the first in a series of steps clearing the way for passage by Friday.Top Senate Republican Mitch McConnell said most of his caucus supports it: ""We're moving toward completing the business for the year. And I think in a highly productive way from the point of view of the vast majority of Senate Republicans.""Failure to pass legislation in time could bring a partial government shutdown beginning Saturday, just before Christmas, and possibly lead into a months-long standoff after Republicans take control of the House on Jan. 3, breaking the grip of Biden's Democrats on both chambers of Congress.Budget experts found fault with the bill's size.""This budget is too late and too big,"" said Maya MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. She noted that much of the spending increases are to keep pace with inflation, but said, ""A lower number would help bring inflation down.""UKRAINE, DISASTER RELIEFIncluded in the bill is $44.9 billion in emergency assistance to Ukraine and NATO allies and $40.6 billion to assist communities across the United States recovering from natural disasters and other matters.The Ukraine funds would be used for military training, equipment, logistics and intelligence support, as well as for replenishing U.S. equipment sent to Kyiv. It also includes funding to prepare for and respond to potential nuclear and radiological incidents in Ukraine. Russian President Vladimir Putin has not ruled out the use of nuclear weapons in the conflict with Ukraine.Included in the Ukraine package is $13.4 billion in economic aide and $2.4 billion to help resettle Ukrainians in the United States.The military aid would be on top of the record $858 billion in U.S. defense spending for the year, which is up from last year's $740 billion and also exceeds Biden's request.On the non-defense side of the ledger, the bill's negotiators have set funding at $800 billion, a $68 billion increase over the previous year. This includes increased healthcare funding for poor children.Among the most significant add-ons to the spending bill is the bipartisan Electoral Count Act, which overhauls and clarifies Congress' certification process for presidential elections.Democrats and many Republicans see the measure as crucial to avoiding a repeat of the chaos that occurred almost two years ago when a mob of Donald Trump supporters attacked the Capitol building in an attempt to overturn Biden's victory.U.S. lawmakers also included a proposal to bar federal employees from using the Chinese short-video app TikTok on government-owned devices. And they backed a proposal to lift a looming deadline imposing a new safety standard for modern cockpit alerts for two new versions of Boeing Co's 737 MAX aircraft.Measures left out include legislation that would have provided citizenship to ""Dreamer"" immigrants, who illegally entered the United States as children.Criminal justice reform advocates came away largely empty-handed, after a compromise measure that would have dramatically lessened the sentencing disparity between crack cocaine and powder cocaine collapsed. And the cannabis industry suffered a defeat after a closely watched measure that would have shored up banking regulations for legal marijuana companies was excluded.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/world/us-senate-advances-1-66-trillion-government-funding-bill-9739051.html,Funding,"A $1.66 trillion government spending bill drew overwhelming bipartisan support in the U.S. Senate on Tuesday as lawmakers steered it toward passage before a weekend deadline to avoid a partial shutdown of federal agencies.Democratic and Republican negotiators agreed early Tuesday morning on the sweeping bill to fund the federal government through the end of its fiscal year on Sept. 30, raising funding from about $1.5 trillion in the last fiscal year.The Senate voted 70-25 to proceed to debate of the bill, with some Republican senators hoping to offer amendments.A handful of conservative Senate Republicans on Tuesday said they objected to the bill, but would not try to stop its passage.""We are not going to win this war with theatrics,"" Braun added.The bill includes other measures agreed on by negotiators from both parties, including a ban on the use of TikTok on government-owned devices and clarification of Congress's role in certifying elections, an attempt to avoid a repeat of the violence of Jan. 6, 2021.Senate and House leaders aim to pass the 4,155-page bill and send it to Democratic President Joe Biden for signing by the end of the week to ensure there are no interruptions to the government's activities.The Tuesday vote was the first in a series of steps clearing the way for passage by Friday.Top Senate Republican Mitch McConnell said most of his caucus supports it: ""We're moving toward completing the business for the year.","['the U.S. Senate', 'Senate', 'Senate', 'Congress', 'House', 'Senate']","['$1.66 trillion', 'about $1.5 trillion', '$44.9 billion', '$40.6 billion', '$13.4 billion', '$2.4 billion', 'the record $858 billion', '$740 billion', '$800 billion', '$68 billion']"

Shleifer was in Bengaluru on November 21 and invited executives from the city and also from other cities like Delhi and Gurugram.People who met Shleifer say he is 'very bullish' about India and sees it as ‘silver-lining,’ as the hedge fund company’s US bets are turning sour, the people said requesting anonymity.“Shleifer wanted to get a sense of the investment sentiment in India as Tiger Global continues to remain extremely bullish on internet companies in the country,” said one of the people quoted above.“Alex Cook was here earlier this year.

They are meeting portfolio companies to understand their problems” the person added.Shleifer told executives from portfolio companies investors that Tiger Global’s private investments in India are doing ‘extremely well’ and are acting as a cushion for the hedge fund company’s public portfolio in the country that includes listed unicorns like Zomato, PB Fintech, Delhivery, and Nasdaq-listed Freshworks among others.

Green shoots? Agritech startups brave funding winter as investments nearly double compared to last fiscal,28 October,"Indian agritech startups raised $296 million across 27 private equity and venture capital deals in the first half of this financial year, almost double the $157 million through 23 deals during the same period in FY22.As other segments grapple with a funding winter, agritech continues to attract investors optimistic about the nascent sector’s potential to grow on rising demand for quality food, supported by macro tailwinds like climate change and food security concerns.Agritech startups fared better in FY23 than in FY22, when funding reached a record $878 million in 54 deals, according to data from analytics firm Venture Intelligence. On a calendar-year basis, investments in the first nine months of 2022 climbed 67 percent to $393 million from $235 million a year earlier.This also comes as investors reduce funding to high-growth startups and turn bullish toward ventures with a focus on profitability.Bucking the trendTotal investments into Indian new-age startups through the PE/VC route slowed by about 49 percent to $9.8 billion in the April to September period in FY23 from $19.2 billion in the same period in FY22 amid rising inflation and shrinking liquidity concerns.While funding for sectors such as edtech, healthtech, and e-commerce moderated after Covid-19 restrictions eased and offline services opened up, others like the fintech segment faced the speed bumps of an uncertain regulatory environment.In the first half of FY23, edtech, healthtech, and e-commerce clocked investments of $629 million, $451 million, and $1.4 billion, respectively. In the same period in FY22, these sectors recorded $1.9 billion, $1.4 billion, and $6.1 billion in funding, respectively, according to data collated by Venture Intelligence. While funding in edtech and healthtech fell by 68 percent each, e-commerce investments declined 77 percent.Fintech companies raised $4.8 billion in the first nine months of 2022, down 8 percent from $5.2 billion in the first nine months of 2021, Moneycontrol reported earlier.Notably, agritech is still far behind established sectors like edtech, e-commerce, fintech, and healthtech in absolute funding amounts as it is a new, emerging sector. Investors said the nascent factor works in its favour.While the sector itself is complex, agritech founders told Moneycontrol that it can be classified into three segments: input and production; processing and warehousing, and market linkages.Covid-19 impactOver the years, new-age tech companies have tried to create disruptive models within and across various segments of the agriculture value chain. The onset of the pandemic in March 2020 brought a shift in how investors perceived agritech ventures. Lockdowns across the world disrupted global supply chains and new-age agritech solutions rose to the occasion.“With the pandemic hitting India, agritech startups stepped into the void to help,” Mark Kahn, cofounder of agritech-focused VC fund Omnivore, told Moneycontrol.Founders said this period provided investors an opportunity to assess the various models within the sector.“Covid-19 was a real game changer for testing which models work and which don’t. The pandemic helped investors build conviction on where they can put their money,” said Chinna Pardhasardhy, cofounder of Waycool, a food development, and distribution services startup founded in 2015.Waycool has raised $404 million in a series of venture equity and debt rounds and is currently valued at $700 million, Pardhasardhy told Moneycontrol.Pardhasardhy said the pandemic opened the doors for newer startups to build on this conviction for the large, untapped base of farmers and other agri stakeholders.Mayank Tewari, cofounder of Reshamandi, a B2B marketplace digitising the natural fibre supply chain, said successful models that scale up and get funded are paving the way for new founders entering the agritech space.“Other founders start to look at that business model and try to replicate a success that’s already out there in another niche area,” he added. “Look at dairy as a sector. For example, Amul. Nobody thought it could be digitised. Then came Stellapps. They digitised the entire chain and changed how people perceived milk or dairy as a sector.”Stellapps is a dairy IoT (Internet of Things) solutions company, building automation tools for dairy farms, cooperatives, and private dairies.Macro factorsStakeholders said macro issues are adding to the tailwinds for the sector.“The depth and breadth of innovation to meet changing food habits and increased demand for quality food post-pandemic have led to a larger pool of quality entrepreneurs entering the sector,” said Rema Subramanian, cofounder of Ankur Capital.Subramanian said this shift, coupled with climate change and food security concerns, has put the transformation of food systems at the top of the agenda globally.Chattanathan Devarajan, cofounder of Arya.ag, an integrated grain commerce platform that focuses on offering post-harvest services, said the problem of food shortage also contributes to unflinching interest in the sector.“Agritech is addressing basic needs. Land is a constant factor and with the population growing, there is a need to address the food shortage issue and increase production,” said Devarajan. He said the fund flow in the sector is just beginning to increase and it has a long way to go.Arya.ag has raised $65 million in funding from investors including Lightrock, Quona, Asia Impact Fund and Omnivore.Global VCsOver the years, startups in the sector have attracted funding from various local sector-focused investors with Omnivore and Ankur Capital the most active in FY22.More recently, founders said global tech investors such as Sequoia Capital and Alpha Wave Global, have started to invest in agritech startups.“People outside the country are also looking into this space and trying to understand it. Indian agritech startups are hence receiving global interest from venture capital firms,” added Waycool’s Pardhasardhy.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/startup/green-shoots-agritech-startups-brave-funding-winter-as-investments-nearly-double-compared-to-last-fiscal-9402621.html,Funding,"On a calendar-year basis, investments in the first nine months of 2022 climbed 67 percent to $393 million from $235 million a year earlier.This also comes as investors reduce funding to high-growth startups and turn bullish toward ventures with a focus on profitability.Bucking the trendTotal investments into Indian new-age startups through the PE/VC route slowed by about 49 percent to $9.8 billion in the April to September period in FY23 from $19.2 billion in the same period in FY22 amid rising inflation and shrinking liquidity concerns.While funding for sectors such as edtech, healthtech, and e-commerce moderated after Covid-19 restrictions eased and offline services opened up, others like the fintech segment faced the speed bumps of an uncertain regulatory environment.In the first half of FY23, edtech, healthtech, and e-commerce clocked investments of $629 million, $451 million, and $1.4 billion, respectively.They digitised the entire chain and changed how people perceived milk or dairy as a sector.”Stellapps is a dairy IoT (Internet of Things) solutions company, building automation tools for dairy farms, cooperatives, and private dairies.Macro factorsStakeholders said macro issues are adding to the tailwinds for the sector.“The depth and breadth of innovation to meet changing food habits and increased demand for quality food post-pandemic have led to a larger pool of quality entrepreneurs entering the sector,” said Rema Subramanian, cofounder of Ankur Capital.Subramanian said this shift, coupled with climate change and food security concerns, has put the transformation of food systems at the top of the agenda globally.Chattanathan Devarajan, cofounder of Arya.ag, an integrated grain commerce platform that focuses on offering post-harvest services, said the problem of food shortage also contributes to unflinching interest in the sector.“Agritech is addressing basic needs.","['edtech', 'edtech', 'cooperatives', 'Ankur Capital', 'Arya.ag']","['$296 million', '$157 million', 'a record $878 million', '$393 million', '$235 million', '$9.8 billion', '$19.2 billion', '$629 million', '$451 million', '$1.4 billion', '$1.9 billion', '$1.4 billion', '$6.1 billion', '$4.8 billion', '$5.2 billion', '$404 million', '$700 million', '$65 million']"

PharmEasy’s annus horribilis may get worse before it gets better,25 October,"API Holdings Limited, the parent of online pharmacy PharmEasy, is having a nightmare of 2022.The company, which was riding high following its multi-million-dollar acquisition of Thyrocare Technologies last year that propelled its valuation to a peak of $5.1 billion, is finding it hard to raise even a few million dollars.The funding winter confronting startups this year owing to surging global interest rates, the capitulation of technology stocks and increasing investor dislike for loss-making, cash-burning companies has hit PharmEasy hard.In August, the company shelved its plans for an Initial Public Offering (IPO), which itself was reported to be at a valuation that was 15-25 percent lower than the 2021 level, in favour of a rights issue to investors.Fear of its inability to convince public investors to fork out $200 million, at a time when loss-making technology companies were subjects of investor derision, was blamed for the IPO being put on hold.Competitive intensityRising competitive intensity in the online pharmacy space due to the rise of Apollo Healthcare, Reliance Industries’ acquisition of Netmeds and Tata Group’s buyout of 1MG have added to investor concern over profitability.All of this has taken a toll on the company’s shares traded in the unlisted market with dealers indicating that the stock has nosedived 77 percent over the past 12 months.“The stock was trading at Rs 135-140 a share in the unlisted market last year but now is available at Rs 30-35 a share,” said a trader on condition of anonymity.Some High Net-worth Individuals (HNIs), who actively deal in shares in the unlisted market, said the stock price could slide to the Rs 15-16 levels before it becomes attractive for them to deal on the counter.“No big investor wants to touch the company at this point,” said another market participant, who consults several HNI and Ultra-HNI investors in the unlisted market, said on condition anonymity.Concern over profitabilityManan Doshi, co-founder of unlistedarena.com, which deals in unlisted shares, said PharmEasy was trading at a considerably moderate valuation after a selloff in the unlisted market.“The topline growth post-acquisitions has been significant. However, it would be interesting to watch when it gets into the profitable zone as investors are now more inclined towards profitability and stable cash flows,"" Doshi said.The firm continued to report huge losses. In 2021-22 its loss widened to Rs 3,981.89 crore from Rs 644.83 crore a year ago because of one-time expenses and charges. Revenue for the financial year rose to Rs 5,728.82 crore from Rs 2,335.27 crore in the previous year.According to a report in the Financial Express, the firm hopes to turn profitable at the Earnings Before Interest, Tax Depreciation and Amortisation (EBITDA) level in the next 4-5 quarters.Chief Executive Officer Siddharth Shah told this to investors at the company’s annual general meeting last week, the report said.Any revival in investor interest and revival of the company's IPO plan will hinge on Shah delivering on his promise of operating profitability but until then, the going is likely to get tougher before it gets easier for India’s first e-pharmacy unicorn.(Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

Nischal Shetty's Shardeum raises seed round of $18.2 mn at a $200 mn valuation,18 October,"Shardeum, a layer-1 blockchain, has raised $18.2 million at a valuation of $200 million in a seed round led by Jane Street, Struck Crypto, The Spartan Group, Big Brain Holdings, DFG, Ghaf Capital Partners, and Foresight Ventures. This round, which has been in the works for over a year, comes amid a difficult environment in which a number of global crypto firms have declared bankruptcy.Shardeum has attracted strategic investors such as CoinGecko Ventures and influential angel investors such as former Coinbase CTO Balaji Srinivasan, Mayur Gupta (CMO at Kraken), Michael Montero (Co-founder, Resy and CrowdTwist), Pankaj Gupta (VP Engineering at Coinbase), Harsh Rajat (Co-founder, Push Protocol), Nakul Gupta (Lead PM at Coinbase NFT Marketplace & Institutional Onboarding), Ajeet Khurana (Founder at Reflexical) and more.Shardeum was founded by Nischal Shetty, co-founder of WazirX, and blockchain architect Omar Syed, who have been working on this project since 2017. Layer 1 refers to a base network, such as Bitcoin or Ethereum, where the blockchain network can validate and finalise transactions without requiring another network.The Beta network is scheduled to launch by the end of the year, with the blockchain aiming to process 200 transactions per second (TPS).“By end of this month, we will demonstrate autoscaling for blockchain network. This means that TPS can increase if there is a higher demand. So, if there is a demand for 100 TPS, Shardeum will complete it. In a bull market, transactions per second are always high whereas, in a bear market, the usage goes down in which case our capacity should go down as well,” said Shetty.The Layer-1 blockchain plans to acquire 25 million users in India and target other emerging markets markets such as Africa, South East Asia among others.Shardeum intends to use the new funds to increase its marketing efforts, expand its development team, and expand its research. Shardeum will also actively host hackathons in India and the US over the next year, as well as provide a platform that incentivizes developers to build and grow the Shardeum ecosystem, according to a statement from the company.Shardeum's native utility token, SHARD ($SHM), which has a fixed supply of 508 million tokens, will be released alongside the mainnet, according to Shetty.Competition with EthereumShardeum will be taking on direct competition with Ethereum, which has attracted developers to build decentralised applications.“If you look at the ecosystem today, the total requirement is 300-500 TPS overall. But, as the ecosystem grows, it will become millions. And none of the blockchains today can serve that. So scaling it to millions, is not possible today and Sharedum will help in solving that,” said Shetty.Shetty expects that the network will grow over the next three to four years as the ecosystem transitions from exchanges to decentralised products. Shetty added that the network plans to cap the gas fee at Rs 1-2. A gas fee is something that the developers need to pay all in order to perform any function on a blockchain.To put this in context, Ethereum's gas fees have been trading between $2 and $4 this month. This has dropped dramatically from its average price of $50-$100 since the blockchain switched to proof of stake last month.Shardeum in its pitch deck said, “The crypto ecosystem is poised to grow from 300M to 1B people in the next 3 years. A large portion of this growth will come from emerging markets such as India, Brazil, Vietnam, Nigeria, Venezuela, Thailand and Turkey. For users in these countries, low gas fees are a must.”“Shardeum will work on ensuring it captures the bulk of new users onboarding to crypto in other emerging markets. At the same time, Shardeum will invest in efforts to attract Ethereum developers to build on its EVM-compatible smart contract platform that will keep fees low even as usage grows; ensuring that developers do not have to move again in the future.”",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/cryptocurrency/nischal-shettys-shardeum-raises-seed-round-of-18-2-mn-at-a-200-mn-valuation-9338611.html,Funding,"Layer 1 refers to a base network, such as Bitcoin or Ethereum, where the blockchain network can validate and finalise transactions without requiring another network.The Beta network is scheduled to launch by the end of the year, with the blockchain aiming to process 200 transactions per second (TPS).“By end of this month, we will demonstrate autoscaling for blockchain network.Shardeum will also actively host hackathons in India and the US over the next year, as well as provide a platform that incentivizes developers to build and grow the Shardeum ecosystem, according to a statement from the company.Shardeum's native utility token, SHARD ($SHM), which has a fixed supply of 508 million tokens, will be released alongside the mainnet, according to Shetty.Competition with EthereumShardeum will be taking on direct competition with Ethereum, which has attracted developers to build decentralised applications.“If you look at the ecosystem today, the total requirement is 300-500 TPS overall.","['Bitcoin or Ethereum', 'SHARD', 'EthereumShardeum', 'Ethereum']","['$18.2 million', '$200 million', 'between $2 and $4', '50-$100']"

"Layoffs will be the absolute last thing at Zoho, it destroys employee loyalty: CEO Sridhar Vembu",14 October,"Bootstrapped Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) major Zoho is focusing on maintaining a strong balance sheet and keeping its net debt zero even as the company has made a commitment to its employees that layoffs will be the absolute last thing at the firm.This comes on the heels of a global economic slowdown coupled with a fear of recession in the US. Most of the SaaS companies in India have around 80% of their businesses in the US and UK.“We understand that times are tough but we have made a commitment to the employees that layoffs would be the absolute last thing we will ever think about because it kind of destroys loyalty,” said Zoho’s co-founder and chief executive Sridhar Vembu on the sidelines of the CNN-News18 Indian of the Year 2022 awards event on October 12.""If we want our employees to be loyal, we have to be loyal to them. Even when times are tough, with a strong balance sheet and strong unit economics, we need to retain our talent here,"" Vembu added.Several top SaaS companies including Zoho have slowed down hirings and are rationalising their employee costs to stay afloat during the tough times.“We have definitely slowed down hiring because the environment is getting difficult and growth rates have come down and may get more difficult is my forecast,” Vembu said.In fact, many startups are undertaking layoffs to save cash and extend the runway as VC funding has slowed. Byju’s, the world's most valued edtech startup, laid off around 2,500 employees across departments to cut costs.Lightspeed-backed edtech startup FrontRow too had laid off around 130 employees four months after sacking a similar number of employees.Zoho’s Vembu stressed the importance of building long-term goals to sustain in tough economic situations.""In this environment, every company should have a long-term goal. Zoho has navigated by maintaining a strong balance sheet and zero debt, and preparing ourselves for this kind of adverse event.

Winter is here! PE/VC funding to Indian startups slowed more than 20% in first 9 months of 2022,03 October,"The funding coming into Indian companies through the private equity, venture capital (PE, VC) route slowed a little over 20 percent by value in the first nine months of 2022 as investors cut their exposure to private markets amid rising inflation and shrinking liquidity.Investors, however, made more number of bets during the period as by volume of these investments grew more than 7 percent during the same period from a year earlier, according to data by Venture Intelligence.PE/VC funds made 1,016 bets worth $36 billion in the January-September 2022 period. In the same period last year, private market investors had made 949 bets worth $45.4 billion, the data showed.In the whole of 2021, PE/VC investors closed 1,342 bets worth $64.8 billion, thanks to the abundant liquidity in the banking system. However, with the pandemic receding and inflation rising, central banks have been rolling back excess liquidity from the banking system and are raising rates to tame inflation, resulting in money becoming expensive. Investors (both private and public market) have thus cut back on their investments this year and a full-blown revival in funding is unlikely over the next 12-18 months at least.The funding winter has also led to investors making smaller-sized bets, especially at late-stage deals. According to data by Venture Intelligence, the average deal size of late-stage transactions (investment into companies that are over 10 years old, or Series G or later rounds of institutional investments) fell over 25 percent to $103 million in 2022 (first nine months) from $138 million in the whole of 2021.Growth-stage PE deals that involve seed to Series D investments of more than $20 million into companies that are not more than 10 years old or Series E to Series F of institutional investments into companies younger than 10 years also saw average cheque size falling 6 percent to $72 million in the first nine months of 2022 versus $77 million in the whole of 2021.However, early-and-growth-stage deal sizes have gone up in the first nine months of 2022 versus the whole of 2021.

Neo-banking crypto startup Juno raises $18 million led by ParaFi Capital,01 October,"Neo-banking crypto startup Juno has raised $18 million in a Series A round led by ParaFi Capital’s Growth Fund to expand its digital banking product suite and launch the first tokenised loyalty program. This round comes at a time when crypto startups are struggling to float through the bear market.The round also saw participation from Hashed, Jump Crypto, Uncorrelated Fund, Greycroft, Mithril, Antler Global, 6th Man Ventures and Abstract Ventures.Founded by three Indian entrepreneurs Varun Deshpande, Ratnesh Ray, and Siddharth Verma, the startup is also backed by Balaji Srinivasan (ex-CTO of Coinbase) and Surojit Chatterjee (CPO of Coinbase), Ryan Selkis (Founder, Messari), Sandeep Nailwal and Jaynti Kanani (Founders of Polygon), Sriram Krishnan (General Partner, a16z), ​​and Venu Palaparthi (President, FTX Capital Markets).This was the second startup founded by the trio after their previous platform, BeeWise, built for commerce apps, was acquired by Aditya Birla Money.In 2019, Juno started off as a neobank Nuo protocol focusing on cross-border remittances for Indian immigrants. In 2020, it shut down to pursue a more regulated approach to crypto. The same year, it also raised a seed round of $3 million from Sequoia India’s accelerator programme, Surge, along with Polychain Capital, Consensys Ventures and Dragonfly Capital.Today, it has evolved into a crypto- native platform, enabling users to convert a part of their salaries into tokens with ease.Moneycontrol reported this Series A round earlier in March.Juno’s crypto-native banking platform is now processing over $1 Billion in annualized transaction volume. It has also seen a 10x user growth in the last 9 months, during one of the worst bear markets in crypto. 1 in every 3 debit cards spends using a Juno card is now in USDC.USDC is a form of cryptocurrency that is identified as a stablecoin, meaning it is linked to an existing asset, in this case, the US Dollar. Stablecoins stay at a fixed value, in line with the asset they are linked to. This lends them stability and results in fewer drastic fluctuations. So, in this scenario, 1 USDC = 1 US Dollar.The platform provides a complete loop to convert the currency to USDC, earn a 4 percent annual yield on the same and also a metal MasterCard debit card that allows users to spend their USDC.The startup is also launching its own token. In a statement, the company said, “It is one of the first tokens launched with no allocation for founders, investors or employees. Over 75,000 Juno members are already eligible to claim 150 Million Juno coins in airdrop for their previous activities on the Juno platform.”Varun Deshpande, Co-Founder and CEO at Juno, said, “Crypto natives in the US are finding existing banks completely inadequate for everyday use of crypto. We are rebuilding a checking account from the ground up with crypto and web3 at its core. Juno empowers members to earn part of their paycheck in crypto and use crypto for everyday transactions like bill payments or buying coffee.”",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/cryptocurrency/neo-banking-crypto-startup-juno-raises-18-million-led-by-parafi-capital-9262571.html,Funding,"This round comes at a time when crypto startups are struggling to float through the bear market.The round also saw participation from Hashed, Jump Crypto, Uncorrelated Fund, Greycroft, Mithril, Antler Global, 6th Man Ventures and Abstract Ventures.Founded by three Indian entrepreneurs Varun Deshpande, Ratnesh Ray, and Siddharth Verma, the startup is also backed by Balaji Srinivasan (ex-CTO of Coinbase) and Surojit Chatterjee (CPO of Coinbase), Ryan Selkis (Founder, Messari), Sandeep Nailwal and Jaynti Kanani (Founders of Polygon), Sriram Krishnan (General Partner, a16z), ​​and Venu Palaparthi (President, FTX Capital Markets).This was the second startup founded by the trio after their previous platform, BeeWise, built for commerce apps, was acquired by Aditya Birla Money.In 2019, Juno started off as a neobank Nuo protocol focusing on cross-border remittances for Indian immigrants.The same year, it also raised a seed round of $3 million from Sequoia India’s accelerator programme, Surge, along with Polychain Capital, Consensys Ventures and Dragonfly Capital.Today, it has evolved into a crypto- native platform, enabling users to convert a part of their salaries into tokens with ease.Moneycontrol reported this Series A round earlier in March.Juno’s crypto-native banking platform is now processing over $1 Billion in annualized transaction volume.","['Uncorrelated Fund', 'Man Ventures', 'Abstract Ventures', 'Venu Palaparthi', 'FTX Capital', 'neobank Nuo', 'Sequoia India’s', 'Polychain Capital', 'Consensys Ventures', 'Dragonfly Capital']","['$18 million', '$3 million', 'over $1 Billion', '1 US Dollar']"
Rising venture debt market in India: A strategic shift or a short-term frenzy?,28 September,"The demand for venture debt in India is on the rise, with the total amount deployed growing by 11 percent to $312 million by August 2022, as against $280 million during the same period last year, amidst a slowdown in venture capital (VC) disbursements.Volatility in the equity markets and the fact that startups are unable to find the desired valuation in the last 6-8 months are making venture debt a more viable option across late and growth stages.To be sure, venture capital disbursements till August 2022 stood at $19.9 billion, while till August 2021, the disbursements were around $21.3 billion, according to data from Venture Intelligence.Top venture debt players in the Indian market, including Alteria Capital, Trifecta Ventures, Stride Ventures, and Innoven, among others, are expecting to close the year with almost 50-60 percent more jump in deployment from around $341 million in 2021.“Last year, we saw a significant increase in all deal flows and the venture debt market was also growing. We committed about Rs 400 crore. This year, it will be higher as money (that is available with venture debt companies) for deploying is growing,” Vinod Murali, managing partner at Alteria Capital, told Moneycontrol.How venture debt players standCurrently, Alteria has around Rs 2,800 crore in assets under management (AUM) and a portfolio that includes at least eight unicorns, including Infra.Market, BharatPe, Cars24, and Rebel Foods. Unicorns are startups valued at $1 billion or above. Alteria is also currently raising funds for the third round.Similarly, Trifecta Capital expects to invest 30 percent more than what it did in 2021“This rapid increase is coming from greater founder awareness, more innovative structuring, deeper and more diverse pools of capital as well as the overall market sentiment shifting towards sustainable business growth,” said Rahul Khanna, managing partner at Trifecta Capital, which has backed the likes of Arzooo, Cars24, BigBasket, and BlackBuck.Since the beginning of FY22, aggressive tech investors are reducing their exposure to high-growth companies and are focusing on profitable businesses with sustainable business models.Many venture capital and private equity companies are also advising startups that need cash to survive to consider flat and down rounds, or turn to venture debt as valuations across the globe are falling.In fact, in a conversation with Moneycontrol, Apoorva Sharma, managing partner at Stride Ventures, said revenue multiples for certain sectors have started to sober up.“For B2B (business-to-business) Saas (Software-as-a-service) companies, the multiple on revenue had reached more than 40-45x, which has now come down back to the 10-15x,” he said.The same has been the case for B2C (Business-to-consumer) e-commerce sector, according to Sharma. “Again a very bloated sector, multiples had reached 10-15x. It has come back to around 6x kind multiples on revenue,” she added.Witnessing a dip in valuations, startups seem to turn towards venture debt. “Factoring the current market scenario on our underwriting and being only halfway through September, we have disbursed Rs 10 crore in one deal so far. We have two more in the execution stage amounting to Rs 20 crore,” said  Ankur Bansal, cofounder, and director, BlackSoil.As global interest rates increased, the current value of startups’ cash flows got smaller, thus denting valuations. The publicly listed tech stocks have crashed more than 50 percent from their highs and still look to be treading water. These factors, coupled with funding uncertainty, have left many startups worried about their cash runway.“We have underwritten three loans in this quarter with an average check size of $1 million. We are offering the continuity loans to startups that have more than $1 million in ARR (Annual Recurring Revenue) and their yardstick score is in the top quartile,” said Ravi Chachra, co-founder of 8vdX, a YCombinator-backed venture debt marketplace.More investors shifting focus towards venture debtIn fact, several venture debt players say that many limited partners (LP), including family houses, domestic investors and high net worth individuals (HNIs), have shifted focus towards the venture debt market.Many venture debt investors and LPs, who, traditionally, have only invested in the venture capital market, are looking to tap into this growing segment as it offers a strategic advantage.“Over the last three years, there has been a lot of interest from the domestic pool of capital, pumping money into the venture debt market. Earlier, it used to be very niche. There has been an increase in interest from family offices, and even some founders with liquidity are keen on this asset class,” said Aashish Sharma, managing partner at Innoven Capital.The deal flow has also increased from pockets of late-stage companies and sectors which are not akin to taking debt, said Sharma of Stride Ventures.“This gives us the opportunity to deploy in sectors and stages of companies where we would otherwise not get the opportunity of deploying,” said Sharma. “The interest rates have increased in the market. We are able to increase our pricing by 50 basis points to 75 basis points in certain cases,” Sharma said.Sharing similar views, BlackSoil’s Bansal also said that although nascent and evolving in size, venture debt has garnered investor attention as there is regular income, short tenure investments, and capital safety.Venture debt players keen on I0T, SaaS“Segments where we see high activity include electric mobility and green energy, IoT (internet-of-things), SaaS, health care, logistics, etc. These are also segments which are seeing continued VC interest as well,” said Khanna of Trifecta.While many venture debt firms have said that they remain sector-agnostic, Crypto and Edtech are not in their foray.“Stable business model is a key for raising venture debt and we have several filters. In fact, we haven’t done any crypto deals. We felt it was all binary in nature…we are trying to understand the other startups in the Web3 ecosystem,” Alteria’s Murali told Moneycontrol. “We will take some time and stay away from sectors where there is a lot of regulatory fuzziness,” he added.In fact, data from Venture Intelligence reveals that around 12 deals in 2022 to date have gone into e-commerce, 10 to fintech and around six to Agritech.“The only sector that is probably fizzled out and not doing well is Edtech because a bubble was created there and there were too many companies that came very soon. This is a general consumer behaviour that has changed. People are now back on the streets, and schools and colleges have opened after COVID,” said Stride’s Sharma.Growing use cases and tight due diligenceUse cases which are seeing increased demand include financing inorganic growth opportunities as the environment is ripe for consolidation in several segments, said Trifecta’s Khanna.“Financing working capital and capex are significant use cases as several companies have realised that an asset-light strategy may not be suited for all contexts,” he added.Meanwhile, the focus on corporate governance, due diligence, and investor reporting has increased, and amidst high deal flows, venture debt players still play the field cautiously.“Earlier we used strike 1 out of 10 deals. Now, we are assessing 20-30 companies before making a deal,” said Sharma of Stride Ventures.“Definitely from a multiple on GMV (gross merchandise value), people have shifted to multiples on net revenue. They are also cognizant of how your bottom line looks, and how your unit economics looks. That has changed. Earlier, people were not bothered about what happens in the P&L below GMV,” she added.Not a short-term frenzy or an equity alternative“There is a far deeper and structural trend on the quality of businesses, knowledge, networks and acumen of founders and depth in capital markets which are happening in the Indian startup ecosystem,” said Trifecta’s Khanna.“It is only natural that debt and other forms of financing will grow to at least 10-15 percent of equity flows as these long-term trends play out, as they have done in other markets,” he said.Reduced FOMO (fear of missing out) sentiments among venture capital players, correcting valuations and the need for sourcing other asset classes will keep fuelling the growth of venture debt.“Venture debt is not always a substitute for venturecapital. Venture debt and equity usually go hand-in-hand. Companies that will not be able to raise equity in the near-term may also find it hard to raise debt. The debt is basically to delay their fundraise, keep the business running and raise equity when valuations are right,” said Innoven’s Sharma.At present, the key for most startup founders is in extending the runway to the next equity fund-raise.“While debt levels will rise across the startup ecosystem, most founders understand this is a stop-gap arrangement and equity will be a necessity. Further, it should be noted that most startups accessing venture debt have either decent existing runways, robust business models or are market leaders,” said Ankur Bansal of Blacksoil.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/startup/rising-venture-debt-market-in-india-a-strategic-shift-or-a-short-term-frenzy-9241771.html,Funding,"The demand for venture debt in India is on the rise, with the total amount deployed growing by 11 percent to $312 million by August 2022, as against $280 million during the same period last year, amidst a slowdown in venture capital (VC) disbursements.Volatility in the equity markets and the fact that startups are unable to find the desired valuation in the last 6-8 months are making venture debt a more viable option across late and growth stages.To be sure, venture capital disbursements till August 2022 stood at $19.9 billion, while till August 2021, the disbursements were around $21.3 billion, according to data from Venture Intelligence.Top venture debt players in the Indian market, including Alteria Capital, Trifecta Ventures, Stride Ventures, and Innoven, among others, are expecting to close the year with almost 50-60 percent more jump in deployment from around $341 million in 2021.“Last year, we saw a significant increase in all deal flows and the venture debt market was also growing.Alteria is also currently raising funds for the third round.Similarly, Trifecta Capital expects to invest 30 percent more than what it did in 2021“This rapid increase is coming from greater founder awareness, more innovative structuring, deeper and more diverse pools of capital as well as the overall market sentiment shifting towards sustainable business growth,” said Rahul Khanna, managing partner at Trifecta Capital, which has backed the likes of Arzooo, Cars24, BigBasket, and BlackBuck.Since the beginning of FY22, aggressive tech investors are reducing their exposure to high-growth companies and are focusing on profitable businesses with sustainable business models.Many venture capital and private equity companies are also advising startups that need cash to survive to consider flat and down rounds, or turn to venture debt as valuations across the globe are falling.In fact, in a conversation with Moneycontrol, Apoorva Sharma, managing partner at Stride Ventures, said revenue multiples for certain sectors have started to sober up.“For B2B (business-to-business) Saas (Software-as-a-service) companies, the multiple on revenue had reached more than 40-45x, which has now come down back to the 10-15x,” he said.The same has been the case for B2C (Business-to-consumer) e-commerce sector, according to Sharma.","['VC', 'Venture Intelligence', 'Alteria Capital', 'Trifecta Ventures', 'Stride Ventures', 'Innoven', 'Trifecta Capital', 'Trifecta Capital', 'Arzooo', 'BigBasket', 'Moneycontrol', 'Stride Ventures', '“For B2B (business-']","['$312 million', '$280 million', '$19.9 billion', 'around $21.3 billion', 'around $341 million', '$1 billion', '$1 million', 'more than $1 million']"

"Pivots, token delay, funding crunch: Indian Web3 founders get a reality check",01 September,"The fear of missing out (FOMO) factor which led many entrepreneurs to start up in Web3 and venture capitalists to invest in these firms last year, is now almost over, as the sector is grappling to build decentralised solutions for real-life problems amid funding winter.Web3, which means the products and services are built on blockchain, is touted to be the next version of the Internet wherein all these products are decentralised.“Entrepreneurs who were starting up are now pivoting, delaying token launches and fundraises. Their team members have either left or have been asked to leave. These are now very common,” said an entrepreneur, who was also planning to launch a token for his Web3 venture but has delayed its launch, requesting anonymity.Further, entrepreneurs and investors say that growth-stage deals have almost come to a halt while pre-seed and seed rounds are still being closed.“In terms of deal flow, we are down by 30 percent compared to last year. But, there is a lot of competition for seed rounds. Growth-stage deals are much tougher now,” said Hemant Mohapatra, partner at Lightspeed India.Last year, the burgeoning sector raised $0.5 billion, while in the first six months of this year, the sector raised over $1 billion.During the funding frenzy last year, coupled with the crypto bull market, scores of startups raised funding on the basis of just starting up in the crypto, NFT or larger Web3 space.Tough questionsBut many of these startups are getting a reality check as now questions are being asked about the real use cases and monetisation of many of these ideas.“When you try to really do something impactful for a larger set of audience then you need a real business plan, basic economics, logistics and compliance. That is where we are at,” said former CoinDCX executive Manhar Garegrat who is now starting up a Web3 venture of his own.The magic phase where you could just do something because it is new and interesting is over, he added.Santhosh Panda, the founder of Foundership, said, “This year has shown us that Web3 is not ready even with the basic tools for us to function. If a new crypto user has to use a service, he or she will struggle with the MetaMask wallet. It can be solved at some point but we need to take more bets on infrastructure and tools rather than tokens.”Is the FOMO phase over?While on one hand, the funding winter did not stop large venture firms from raising mega funds to invest in Web3, cheques are going out only after intense scrutiny.Garegrat added, “The FOMO era is over. The massive rally that was happening that everyone wanted to be a part of, is over. A majority of those projects that picked up in the bull cycle have lost a lot of value. We are now seeing the decentralised and the centralised worlds coming together.”The industry is now seeing the need to be more rooted in reality, the centralised world as well as more cognisant of compliance and regulatory needs.“Brands, founders, investors who just wanted to make easy money last year are now out of Web3. This has improved the quality. If someone is starting up in Web3 now, you know it is not for the short term, which helps you make the distinction,” said Pareen Lathia, co-founder of Buidlers Tribe.Things have significantly changed over the last few months due to multiple factors like the crypto market crash and funding crunch in the startup ecosystem, among others.What changed?The concerns from investors are now more on compliance and products that can solve real-life problems. In fact, this sector has drawn this criticism periodically.Around 2017-2018, when crypto startups raised capital through initial coin offerings (ICOs), many of them could not build a product to solve a real issue. This has also been a fear in the industry which has raised more scepticism among the critics.The experts say that infrastructure projects, DAO tools, NFTs for the creator economy have been some of the areas that investors are keen about. But Lathia adds, “Last year’s theme which was drawing investments was majorly NFTs and DAOs. People are yet to find out what’s the next theme in Web3.”While some are optimistic that the market will start reviving within the next few months which will draw capital, some say that it will take 18-24 months, based on the previous downturns.“Every technology goes through cycles. Crypto has gone through multiple cycles and many valuable companies were built during the bear market. Overall, this is the time to go deeper and make more investments. This is also the time when we find founders with more understanding of the market,” said Vaas Bhaskar, principal at early-stage fund Elevation Capital.But..no dearth of talent However, experts say that interest in crypto or Web3 is far from dead.CoinDCX founders earlier told Moneycontrol that they have 25,000 applications in the pipeline and plan to hire 1,000 this year.Former Coinswitch Kuber executive Sharan Nair who is now building Web3 venture PYOR Edge agrees.He reasons, “There is a difference when you are working in Web3, suddenly you are part of a community, you're changing your DP with light in your eyes. You are speaking a different lingo on Twitter. You can see a change in personality when people move from Web2 to Web3. They even dress more casually and start sending memes to each other. The culture attracts a lot of young talent.”Both Garegrat and Nair say that they have been flooded with resumes.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/cryptocurrency/pivots-token-delay-funding-crunch-indian-web3-founders-get-a-reality-check-9114741.html,Funding,"The fear of missing out (FOMO) factor which led many entrepreneurs to start up in Web3 and venture capitalists to invest in these firms last year, is now almost over, as the sector is grappling to build decentralised solutions for real-life problems amid funding winter.Web3, which means the products and services are built on blockchain, is touted to be the next version of the Internet wherein all these products are decentralised.“Entrepreneurs who were starting up are now pivoting, delaying token launches and fundraises.Growth-stage deals are much tougher now,” said Hemant Mohapatra, partner at Lightspeed India.Last year, the burgeoning sector raised $0.5 billion, while in the first six months of this year, the sector raised over $1 billion.During the funding frenzy last year, coupled with the crypto bull market, scores of startups raised funding on the basis of just starting up in the crypto, NFT or larger Web3 space.Tough questionsBut many of these startups are getting a reality check as now questions are being asked about the real use cases and monetisation of many of these ideas.“When you try to really do something impactful for a larger set of audience then you need a real business plan, basic economics, logistics and compliance.","['FOMO', 'NFT']","['$0.5 billion', 'over $1 billion']"

Servify raises $65 million funding; to launch IPO in 18-24 months,24 August,"Servify, which powers the after-sales experience for a range of device manufacturers, on August 24 said it raised $65 million in Series D financing led by Singularity Growth Opportunity Fund, bucking the funding slowdown in late-stage startups due to tough market conditions.Strategic investors such as US insurance holdings firm AmTrust, family offices, including that of Fevicol-maker Pidilite, along with existing investors such as Iron Pillar, Beenext, Blume Ventures, and DMI Sparkle Fund also participated in the round.The company plans to use the funds to expand its products, scale its technology platform and grow its business in international markets apart from scouting for acquisition opportunities.While Servify didn't disclose its valuation in this round, founder Sreevathsa Prabhakar told Moneycontrol that were closing in on a $1 billion valuation.Ready to go public""We are not somebody who's valuation hungry since we want to build a really strong business. One thing I can tell you is we will go public in about 18 to 24 months, we are doing everything required to go public. Let the markets decide the valuation rather than any private investor"" Prabhakar said.Started in 2015 by Prabhakar, Servify works with several global original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) such as Apple, Samsung, OnePlus and Xiaomi to run their after-sales product care programmes, including providing extended warranty coverage. It also powers the smart exchange and upgrade programmes for such brands.The startup claims to have partnerships with over 75 brands that include retailers, distributors, insurers, financial institutions, product liquidators, service providers, and carriers, besides consumer electronics manufacturers.Nokia, Etisalat, Croma, Walmart, Reliance Retail, Amazon, and Flipkart are some the brands it works with.Driving affordabilityServify recently extended its platform to enable affordable purchases by aggregating features such as no-cost EMI, card-linked offers, Buy Now Pay Later (BNPL) and instant discounts among others.Prabhakar told Moneycontrol that they were running a pilot on this aggregation model in over 200 Apple-authorised reseller stores in cities such as Delhi, Mumbai and Nagpur.""We will run this pilot for another three to four months. Once we learn all the market nuances, then we will probably scale across all the outlets where we are present"" he said.Servify claims to have a distribution presence in more than 50,000 outlets.Prabhakar, however, said the firm was not taking any risks on its books. ""The idea is to provide a single platform where the entire digital customer KYC to lending decisions to underwriting will happen digitally,"" he said.The move would also enable the company to bring in new lenders who do not have a retail distribution presence to simply plug onto their platform and participate in the lending play, he said.The aggregation model would help Servify expand its capabilities to an entire product lifecycle—from helping customers buy a product to help them use it for a longer time and then enable an upgrade or exchange the product, Prabhakar said.""We are building a massive global business from India that is already at an annual revenue run rate of over $130 million and is on the verge of turning profitable,"" Prabhakar said.International expansionGlobal expansion is a big focus area for Servify.

How upGrad’s co-founder Mayank Kumar raised one of India’s largest funding rounds this year amid edtech slowdown,23 August,"At a time when funding to India’s startup ecosystem, especially to edtech companies, has slowed down significantly this year, edtech unicorn upGrad, backed by entrepreneur and angel investor Ronnie Screwvala who is also the company’s co-founder and chairman, raised one of the country’s largest funding rounds of 2022.UpGrad, which offers executive education programmes, raised $210 million from a clutch of investors and saw its valuation rise to nearly $2.25 billion, compared with the $185 million it had raised in April last year in a round led by Singapore’s Temasek Holdings at a valuation of $1.2 billion.In an hour-long chat with Moneycontrol, Mayank Kumar, co-founder and managing director of upGrad, shared his experience of raising funds in such an environment and explained why the company’s been on an acquisition spree.Kumar also said upGrad could turn profitable by the end of this financial year if it does not launch a new stream or does not invest in any more mergers and acquisitions. Edited excerpts:UpGrad has raised a large round recently. How does the company plan to use the funds?Our core business is profitable and does not require cash, so the funds are not for that. Broadly, there are two main objectives. One is, that there are certain new businesses that we have incubated within the context of upGrad, so we have ventured into (offering services to students wishing to) study abroad. We are looking at some job-linked programmes also, and we are looking at international expansion.We are looking at establishing ourselves strongly in the US market. So some of these places where we were not present earlier, those places will definitely get funding.The second one is going to be again looking at judiciously using the capital for some kind of an M&A (merger and acquisition) and ensuring that the right set of founders and partners come along with us to build the business out. So those would be the two broad use cases—the new businesses we’re venturing into and any M&A that we are contemplating for the future is where we would use the capital.The round that the company raised recently also is one of India’s largest rounds of 2022 and at a time when funding to Indian startups, especially edtech companies, has slowed. How was it to raise the round? What were the conversations with investors like, were the conversations different from 2021?It (fundraising) is never enjoyable, I can say that from the bottom of my heart, with absolute honesty, whether it is good times or bad times. I mean, you always want to be fully in control of your destiny and, therefore, fundraising is just one way of getting to the destiny. But even in good times, you will compromise on something.I do believe good money is still chasing good companies. I have always firmly believed in that and I think it still holds true. But there are three-four things that I sensed were very different when we were looking at raising capital. One, it was not a conversation about growth at any cost. A lot of it was about growth at the right cost and the cost structure that you are building. People were not questioning about TAM (total addressable market) but mostly about when you will turn profitable, and how quickly will you turn profitable.There was less conversation about unit economics also, it was rather like today are you profitable, how much cash are you spending on a daily basis. So now it is not as much as conjectures, but mostly on today’s as-is situation. So the narrative perhaps four-five quarters ago could have been, hey we are doing this, our unit economics will turn positive. Now the question was, is it positive today, are you generating cash or capital or profits from the system today?Did you get the valuation you were seeking? Was there any mismatch between what investors were seeking to give you and what you were seeking?There was no mismatch over that, but conversations definitely happened over the valuation. Valuation is not a benchmark that we chase at upGrad. But we were very clear about at what valuation we wanted people to come in.There were question marks as to what justified the valuation, which of course happened. Now, we may not have faced the situation but I’ve heard multiple cases where many conversations have stalled because of valuation.I guess founders have to be smart about it at this point in time. If you’re in need for the long run, then once in a while you have that sort of valuation conversation but have to continue building the business, and in the long run, you’ll see the results coming.Given that investors are increasingly focusing more on profitability, how and by when do you see upGrad achieving profitability at a company level?Capital coming in needs the right return on the capital employed. And so that’s something that we’re cautious about and, therefore, even when funding was available, in a very large quantum and easily available, we did not go out and spend it all because we valued money.Even today, when the situations are looking slightly different, even when the colour of the ecosystem is changing, we still have the same approach. Our DNA was not growing at any cost, but growing at the right cost, and even today the approach remains the same.But while our core business can be profitable, some of the new businesses will require capital, therefore there will be losses that will come in. But I think this year at an overall level upGrad will be profitable, unless we venture into a new line of business that will require some additional capital or we acquire a company that is loss-making.But otherwise, the core business will turn profitable this year, FY23. We have multiple lines of business. We have working professionals, we have study abroad, and so on. WP (working professionals) is definitely profitable. Other lines are not. But most other businesses that have been there for over a year will turn profitable.In a recent interview, chairman and co-founder Ronnie Screwvala talked about how edtech companies should focus less on advertising and reduce their cost of acquiring customers. How does upGrad look at advertising?Advertising is one of the biggest reasons why educational companies scale or don’t scale, because acquiring customers is tough. So advertising and television advertising definitely helps companies when you have to create awareness for the brand and second, for the category, because what many of us are doing is not something we have grown up doing.So if you’re doing some kind of concept creation, there will be some investment required to create the concept and, therefore, it definitely is relevant and useful because the way marketing has worked is that you take it to a certain level, you come up, you come back again, market and move it up, move it up. It’s a step ladder function in which the ecosystem sort of moves up.Coming to our approach, we look at television ads as very core to our journey. We don’t rely on this but at some point, sometimes you want to pass on a concept, we will leverage television advertising. A lot of our focus has been largely around digital in our own proprietary channel. So this time around what we’re also noticing is that there’s enough efficiency that is possible, even in the proprietary channels.How have you seen your revenues growing over the last two-three years, and how much do you expect your revenues to grow this year?We have consistently got about 100 percent year-over-year from FY16-17 onwards, FY17-18 onwards. If you see, we have always seen 100 percent growth. Even this year we will see 100 percent-plus growth. From (FY)21 to (FY)22, it wasn’t 100 percent but 95 or 97 percent. And this year also ended up at about 100 percent.UpGrad has also acquired a lot of companies this year. What are the strategies and synergies behind these acquisitions? Did the company go aggressively behind acquisitions this year, given that edtech valuations were dwindling?Our approach is focused on a lifelong learning journey, which starts from post-K through 12 (post-kindergarten to 12th grade), let’s say from 18 to 55-60s (age group). And we look at two broad segments, college levels, and working professionals.So if you look at our strategy of acquisition, our goal is to create a platform where the learner comes back to us again and again, asking for our courses.Talking about synergies, I will not curtail the founders’ energy. It’s our focus is to give founders enough bandwidth to do what they want to do, not get them pulled into 20 percent synergies here, 30 percent synergies there. Because we believe that the founders who get the right environment will build a large business.Right now, when we look at M&A, our focus is clearly on business, and in business that is to build, not in terms of capability, or to acqui-hire and therefore get a new set of capabilities, whether you hire a new tech team and new content team—that’s not the approach that we are taking, the approach is that the business that worked in a very different environment can under the upGrad umbrella really be turbocharged.There are some larger-funded players in the space like Byju’s-owned Great Learning and Eruditus. How do you see competition in the space?The names that you mentioned have built some really good products and target very unique sectors. Today, something I see is that some of our competitors have one foot in India and abroad. So the focus on India is not fully there, and that has allowed us to, I mean, I can very clearly say that just in terms of Indian revenue, we are at least twice, three times bigger than the next competitor’s India revenue.I do see that there is competition. The good part of the competition is all of us evolving towards building the market and the not-so-good part of the competition is that amongst all of us, if there’s one ecosystem where we all are giving in—the marketing ecosystem. I think if I can invest more in the products and make sure that the outcomes for the learners are better, all of us will benefit.What according to you are some of the interesting themes emerging in the edtech sector? What are the areas that potential entrepreneurs can target and solve?If you have outcomes, you will get repeats; if you have outcomes, you will get referrals. If you have outcomes, then the cost of marketing will come down, if you have outcomes the cost of sales will come down.If I did not have those thousands of positive stories, it would be very difficult for me to maintain customer acquisition cost below a certain threshold. So I think outcomes will be something where there will be focus.We will see interesting models coming in, end-to-end, owning the full education, not just supplementary education, not just tuition test prep. That shift, you will see happening.India would also see the emergence of good B2B models.What are upGrad’s plans for going public? Are there certain milestones before you think of going for an initial public offering (IPO)?It (IPO) is definitely in our plans. When you need to go public there are two or three things that are very important. One of the most important things is predictability and that needs to be built out. It’s another 18-30 months’ journey for us and that’s what we’re working towards.It all depends upon how the situation changes. But definitely, going public is 100 percent within our sight, in our mind.Profitability is one of the criteria. Again, I would not say perhaps the most important criterion, but certainly an important factor. More than that, I think the predictability of business is the most important.As you know, when you go public, every time you get asked one question—you’re doing this in this quarter, what would the next quarter look like? You call it guidance, right, and for that, you need to build a business plan which is predictable, and that will only happen if the product that we build is predictable.What would a three to four-year plan for upGrad look like? What do you want to achieve by the end of 2026?Well, we’ll see, let’s say by 2026, getting close to $2 billion in revenues. Second, the true case for lifelong learning to come up, $2 billion is not happening if a lifelong learning thesis is not laid out.I think one of the biggest values for me, as I said, I genuinely would like to be a product for the 60-70 million-plus working population in India, and 200-300 million globally. We would like to be lifelong learning and career partner. You may have a telecom partner, you may have an insurance partner—we want to be your career partner to support you in your journey.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/startup/how-upgrads-co-founder-mayank-kumar-raised-one-of-indias-largest-funding-rounds-this-year-amid-edtech-slowdown-9069481.html,Funding,"At a time when funding to India’s startup ecosystem, especially to edtech companies, has slowed down significantly this year, edtech unicorn upGrad, backed by entrepreneur and angel investor Ronnie Screwvala who is also the company’s co-founder and chairman, raised one of the country’s largest funding rounds of 2022.UpGrad, which offers executive education programmes, raised $210 million from a clutch of investors and saw its valuation rise to nearly $2.25 billion, compared with the $185 million it had raised in April last year in a round led by Singapore’s Temasek Holdings at a valuation of $1.2 billion.In an hour-long chat with Moneycontrol, Mayank Kumar, co-founder and managing director of upGrad, shared his experience of raising funds in such an environment and explained why the company’s been on an acquisition spree.Kumar also said upGrad could turn profitable by the end of this financial year if it does not launch a new stream or does not invest in any more mergers and acquisitions.Because we believe that the founders who get the right environment will build a large business.Right now, when we look at M&A, our focus is clearly on business, and in business that is to build, not in terms of capability, or to acqui-hire and therefore get a new set of capabilities, whether you hire a new tech team and new content team—that’s not the approach that we are taking, the approach is that the business that worked in a very different environment can under the upGrad umbrella really be turbocharged.There are some larger-funded players in the space like Byju’s-owned Great Learning and Eruditus.","['edtech', 'Moneycontrol', 'Byju’s', 'Great Learning and Eruditus']","['$210 million', 'nearly $2.25 billion', '$185 million', '$1.2 billion', 'close to $2 billion', '$2 billion']"
Dukkantek seals $10 million funding round led by BECO,19 August,"Store management platform Dukkantek on August 19 announced an oversubscribed $10 million pre-series A funding round.The funding round was led by BECO with significant participation from Rocketship and Colle Capital. Other strategic investors in the round included Comma Capital, AMK Investment Office, Chaos Ventures, and Wamda Capital. The funding round follows their $5.2 million seed round in October 2021, taking their total funds raised to $15.2 million.Dukkantek, which was founded in January 2021 by Ali Al Sayegh, Sanad Yaghi, and Shadi Joulani, has so far scaled across the MENA region with SMB retailers adopting their technology for customer services, business processes, and faster growth, the company said.The platform currently powers the digital ecosystem for 13 million SMB retailers across the United Arab Emirates, Oman, Qatar, Kuwait, Bahrain, Turkey, and Saudi Arabia, and is looking for more opportunities in North Africa.Commenting on the development Dukkantek Co-founder Sanad Yaghi said: “For too long, the owners of small and medium-sized businesses have been left on the margins of the technology shift; now we are serving their unmet needs. We bring a technology platform consisting of three different value propositions that enable these merchants to compete in a digital world.”“This includes a set of tools that enables merchants to run their businesses more effectively. Payments options ensure merchants can offer customers more choice about how to settle their bills. And an e-commerce offering which gives merchants everything they need to start selling online for the first time and to manage that operation in tandem with the brick-and-mortar business. Many merchants struggle to keep track of inventory when selling both online and in physical stores, so having one system that incorporates both parts of the business is very important,” Yaghi added.Yaghi further said: “We have seen an increase in users accessing analytics tools on the platform which, for example, help them understand which products will sell best. Three-quarters of the businesses on the platform are now trading in this way. Also, many merchants are keen to expand the number of stores they operate, but are held back by the lack of finance available in the region which we can look to explore.”Abdulaziz Shikh Al Sagha from BECO Capital, which led the funding round, said: “It’s very rare to come across a business and team that have been able to execute the way in which Dukkantek has done so far. Launching seven countries in 18 short months since founding is no easy feat, yet the Dukkantek team has managed to do it in such a seamless and capital efficient manner. We are very excited to partner with Sanad, Ali and the wider team as they look to build on their exciting traction and overall vision of digitising merchants.”During the coronavirus pandemic, community retailers in the UAE without a digital presence, who were unable to accept online payments during the pandemic, were severely affected due to the drop in customer footfall. This hastened digital adoption in the MENA region, leading to an increase in online shopping, in particular.The region's e-commerce market is expected to reach $49 billion in 2025, up almost 55 percent from 2021, a report by EZDubai, an e-commerce zone in Dubai, and Euromonitor International showed earlier this year. Further, the UAE’s e-commerce market alone is forecast to grow 60 percent to more than $8 billion by 2025 from 2021.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/dukkantek-seals-10-million-funding-round-led-by-beco-9058831.html,Funding,"The funding round follows their $5.2 million seed round in October 2021, taking their total funds raised to $15.2 million.Dukkantek, which was founded in January 2021 by Ali Al Sayegh, Sanad Yaghi, and Shadi Joulani, has so far scaled across the MENA region with SMB retailers adopting their technology for customer services, business processes, and faster growth, the company said.The platform currently powers the digital ecosystem for 13 million SMB retailers across the United Arab Emirates, Oman, Qatar, Kuwait, Bahrain, Turkey, and Saudi Arabia, and is looking for more opportunities in North Africa.Commenting on the development Dukkantek Co-founder Sanad Yaghi said: “For too long, the owners of small and medium-sized businesses have been left on the margins of the technology shift; now we are serving their unmet needs.Also, many merchants are keen to expand the number of stores they operate, but are held back by the lack of finance available in the region which we can look to explore.”Abdulaziz Shikh Al Sagha from BECO Capital, which led the funding round, said: “It’s very rare to come across a business and team that have been able to execute the way in which Dukkantek has done so far.","['Dukkantek', 'SMB', 'BECO Capital', 'Dukkantek']","['$10 million', '$5.2 million', '$15.2 million', '$49 billion', 'more than $8 billion']"

Feast to famine: How agritech Dehaat went from record funding to layoffs ,18 August,"Aditya Narayan Giri joined agritech startup DeHaat’s Patna office on March 17, 2022. The company assigned Giri the responsibility of developing model farms in five states: Uttar Pradesh, Odisha, West Bengal, Jharkhand, and Bihar.Model farms are plots with a mix of crop species that support each other and create an ecosystem for the production of cash crops.“I left my job in Haryana and joined the company primarily to stay close to my parents who lived in Patna. I could visit these farms regularly from my base location in Patna,” Giri said.In about two months of joining DeHaat, Giri’s role was pared and he was asked to shift permanently to Bhagalpur, another city in Bihar, and work on the one farm, spread over three acres, in the city. He was refused the funds he needed to hire the employees he needed to work on the farm (the human resources department told him the company was cutting costs) and when he refused to move to Bhagalpur, was let go from the companyHis email requests to talk to senior management were unanswered. The only time someone from DeHaat reached out to him was to offer to negotiate if he took down Twitter and LinkedIn posts sharing his ordeal.“I took the posts down almost immediately, but I never heard from them again,” Giri added.Giri is not alone in a story that has become another cautionary tale for ambitious startups that attempted to conquer new markets and grow rapidly only to come up against a funding winter amid global market turmoil this year.How it unravelled On the afternoon of August 1, Moneycontrol reported that DeHaat had become the latest new-age technology company to resort to layoffs.The move to cut costs and fire employees came barely 10 months after the company raised $115 million in a round that saw participation by investors such as Sofina, Lightrock, Temasek, Sequoia, and Prosus, making it among the largest agritech fundings in India.It also came on the back of a year of aggressive hiring by the company. According to a statement shared by the agritech startup, it had an employee count of over 2,000 out of which over 1,500 people were hired in the past 12 months.In a virtual interaction with Moneycontrol on August 1, DeHaat’s co-founder and chief executive officer (CEO) Shashank Kumar confirmed that the company had let go of people, but said the number of such employees was not in the triple digits.He also said the decision was made only as a corrective measure around performances and due to a “culture misfit.”Employees differ Employees of the company dispute the claims. Many say the number let go is between 250 to 300 and is still increasing. Some have even resigned, fearing being terminated like their colleagues.According to Giri, the entire accounts team that was functioning from Patna was asked to shift to DeHaat’s Gurugram office.One of the employees said that in July, his manager called to inform him that the company intended to transfer him to Gurugram. In the call, the manager told him he would risk immediate termination if he refused.“Unfortunately, my manager who called me to inform me about my termination later also went through the same situation,” the employee said. When the manager refused to move to Gurugram, he was fired by the company, added the employee, who too was laid off in August.Another employee said he had taken pre-approved medical leave from the company on July 28 and 29 for a surgery. On July 28, on his way to the hospital, his senior sent him a Google Meet link for a quick meeting. On joining the meeting, he saw many of his colleagues from Patna and other offices like those in Uttar Pradesh, on the call.“The manager, to our surprise, told us that we were being let go. Some, who were hired especially for new warehouses that were to open in UP, were told that the projects have now been cancelled and hence their service was no longer required.”Others like him from the Patna office were not given a definite reason.According to him, on that day about 120 from the Patna office and over 50 from other offices were asked to move on.“I tried to reason with him telling him that I can work from home, or take leave without pay. I even offered to cancel my medical leave, but none of it worked,” said the former employee.A letter from the company denied that performance issues were the reason for the employee's termination. “I wish to assure you that your disengagement of service from the organisation is not related to your job performance,” said the company.Moneycontrol reviewed a copy of the letter, which was sent to many who were let go.In the letter, the company said the decision has been made due to an “unavoidable impact on business conditions, which has necessitated role restructuring.”Dues remain unpaid DeHaat said the employees would be paid salaries for their notice period of about 90 days within 10 days of their last working date.The last working day for him was July 28. More than 10 days past the deadline, the former employee quoted above has only received a third of his dues after a series of emails to the company.Many others have not received the amount promised to them yet.DeHaat’s chief, Kumar denies the claims. “We strongly object to even a single case where settlement was not done properly. All the cases were dealt with full empathy,” he said in a response to the queries sent by Moneycontrol.Kumar added that the company has made 80 new offers to potential employees to support DeHaat’s growth.Zooming in on DeHaat’s modelFounded in 2012, DeHaat, a Hindi word for village or countryside, has built a full-stack agricultural model which hosts services ranging from distribution of agricultural inputs, customised farm advisory, access to financial services, and market linkages to sell farmers’ produce.For its core verticals - farm input and output, the company has set up DeHaat centres with employees, generally on the company’s payroll, working as distributors and procurers to provide farm inputs such as seeds and fertilisers to farmers and collect yield from them to sell to buyers. An employee said that this also adds to the cost of delivery and transportation to and from the centres.An investor tracking the space believes this added layer of intermediary might be affecting the company’s unit economics. “When you involve an intermediary there is definitely margin that you give up on, on both inputs and outputs. A basic thesis is that the more layers in between, the lesser will be the margin for each of them. The domestic market has very little margin anyway,” he said. Unit economics is a company's cost-to-revenue ratio on its basic unit.He also added that the farther away the company is from the end beneficiary the lower will be the repeats and lifetime value generated.In addition, he said that the startup needs to ascertain the level of non-linearity they are able to drive. He added, “If to do more business, they have to deploy more people, then they aren't getting the benefits and leverage coming out of technology and scale.”Founded a decade ago, the company is still loss-making, DeHaat had a loss of Rs 54.2 crore on revenue of Rs 360.9 crore for the fiscal year ended March 2021, according to its filings with the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA).While the company’s revenue had more than doubled from the previous year, it incurred a similar surge in its expenses, widening its losses almost three times on a year-on-year basis.Agritech startups like Ninjacart, Agrostar, and Absolute are among its competitors. Last year, Ninjacart raised $145 million, Absolute $100 million, and AgroStar $70 million.Around the same time, in October 2021, DeHaat also raised $115 million in what was one of the largest funding rounds for an Indian agritech venture. The round valued the company at over $500 million.So what went wrong? Kumar, in the statement, said, “We have enough runway for more than 2 years since we closed Series D just 9 months ago when capital raised during Series C was still significantly unutilised.”According to sources within the company, however, in less than nine months the funds raised by DeHaat have come down to a third. “At the beginning of the year, the company had around Rs 700 crores, it is now left with Rs 100-200 crores in the bank,” said a source.A former senior-level employee of DeHaat said the company's ambitious and aggressive expansion was one of the main reasons behind the situation at the startup.He said, “They were planning to penetrate into new geographies. Within their core verticals, they were planning on coming up with a B2C (Business to Consumer) model, and they were also expanding their export business.”In the beginning of its operations, the company started out from Bihar, eastern Uttar Pradesh, and so on.According to Kumar, while these older geographies were profitable, the company is trying to expand into new geographies that require some time before they turn profitable.“We have started replicating the model to States like Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh, Gujarat, and Haryana in addition to existing states like Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Odisha, Madhya Pradesh, and Rajasthan. Recently we crossed the milestone of 9,000 DeHaat centres and serving over 1,00,000 unique villages in about 150 districts of India and continuing to grow exactly as per our plan of reaching more than 15,000 DeHaat centres by March 2023,” Kumar said.The investor tracking the space quoted above added that by chasing growth, the company might also be operating at a thin margin, as a result of which the burn is high.Acquisitions In addition, the company has also made four acquisitions since 2019. In April, the company acquired food tech startup Y-Cook India Pvt Ltd for an undisclosed amount in an all-cash deal.This came after it acquired agri-input marketplace startup Helicrofter in January to expand its presence in Maharashtra and the rest of western India.In 2021, it acquired FarmGuide, which allowed the integration of satellite-based crop advisory solutions for farmers. In May 2019, the company acquired VezaMart, a platform that builds farm management solutions for farmers.The struggle for funds DeHaat needs the constant support of funds, to replicate its model in newer locations to grow exponentially and pay for its acquisitions, as the company hasn’t been able to generate cash from operations.An investor of the company said DeHaat was expecting to raise a new round of funding soon to keep the operations running. However, multiple sources told Moneycontrol that owing to the current slowdown in funding to startups, the round has been delayed.“Funding is not a problem for DeHaat, funding at the right valuation is the issue. So in this market, with profits not growing, and expansion plans not materialising, they aren’t able to raise at the current valuation,” said the former senior-level employee cited above.During its last funding round in October, the company was valued at over $500 million, effectively entering the soonicorn or 'soon-to-be-unicorn' club. A unicorn is a startup valued at over $1 billion.Due to uncertainty around the next fundraise, according to the former senior-level employee, the company’s expansion plans have not materialised. The investor with the company added that the cost-cutting measures by the company were an attempt to extend its runway before it can raise the next round of funding.""DeHaat is absolutely on the track of yet another year with three times growth in all aspects - be it revenue or other network metrics like the number of DeHaat centres as well as farmers. We are poised to expand our last mile network of DeHaat micro-entrepreneurs as well as farmers to several geographies as per our plan,” argued Kumar.Kumar, however, did not comment on the funding plans of the company.Until now, the company has raised $162 million from a clutch of investors including Sequoia, Sofina, Lightrock, Temasek, Prosus, Omnivore, and Trifecta Capital, among others.Less than a year ago, DeHaat was seen as a potential candidate to become the next big startup, the first from the agritech sector.It is now at the crossroads of a past boom and an uncertain future.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/startup/feast-to-famine-how-agritech-dehaat-went-from-record-funding-to-layoffs-9048111.html,Funding,"The only time someone from DeHaat reached out to him was to offer to negotiate if he took down Twitter and LinkedIn posts sharing his ordeal.“I took the posts down almost immediately, but I never heard from them again,” Giri added.Giri is not alone in a story that has become another cautionary tale for ambitious startups that attempted to conquer new markets and grow rapidly only to come up against a funding winter amid global market turmoil this year.How it unravelled On the afternoon of August 1, Moneycontrol reported that DeHaat had become the latest new-age technology company to resort to layoffs.The move to cut costs and fire employees came barely 10 months after the company raised $115 million in a round that saw participation by investors such as Sofina, Lightrock, Temasek, Sequoia, and Prosus, making it among the largest agritech fundings in India.It also came on the back of a year of aggressive hiring by the company.All the cases were dealt with full empathy,” he said in a response to the queries sent by Moneycontrol.Kumar added that the company has made 80 new offers to potential employees to support DeHaat’s growth.Zooming in on DeHaat’s modelFounded in 2012, DeHaat, a Hindi word for village or countryside, has built a full-stack agricultural model which hosts services ranging from distribution of agricultural inputs, customised farm advisory, access to financial services, and market linkages to sell farmers’ produce.For its core verticals - farm input and output, the company has set up DeHaat centres with employees, generally on the company’s payroll, working as distributors and procurers to provide farm inputs such as seeds and fertilisers to farmers and collect yield from them to sell to buyers.","['Sequoia', 'Moneycontrol', 'DeHaat', 'DeHaat’s', 'DeHaat']","['$115 million', '$145 million', '$100 million', '$70 million', '$115 million', 'over $500 million', 'over $500 million', 'over $1 billion', '$162 million']"
"Phyllo bags $15 million funding, to build gateway for creator data",17 August,"Phyllo, a startup that is building tools for developers of creator economy applications, said on August 17 it raised $15 million in Series A funding led by RTP Global, signifying the growing investor interest in the burgeoning creator economy.Investors such as Nexus Venture Partners, Better Capital, and iSeed also participated in the round.The startup, which raised $2.8 million in seed funding last year, is backed by angel investors such as Teachable founder Ankur Nagpal, Coinbase executive Nakul Gupta, former Plaid executive Sima Gandhi and Audible executive Pat Shah.Phyllo said it plans to use the funds to accelerate product development, expand its customer base and grow its developer-first API platform.Founded by Akhil Bhiwal, Achintya Gupta, and Mohit Kumar in 2021, Phyllo is building a set of application programme interfaces (APIs) that help businesses and developers get continuous access to verified creator data directly from hundreds of platforms such as YouTube, Instagram, Twitch, TikTok, Patreon, Discord, and Spotify with the creator's permission.Breaking silosIn a statement, Bhiwal said creators were gaining traction but their audience and engagement were boxed into specific platforms. They also faced issues proving their clout.On the other hand, developers building tools and products to help creators struggle to find a verified source of creator data. This is because very few creator or digital-native platforms provide open APIs for integration into their apps. Even if they do, it further requires ""an immense amount of developer time and effort"", the company said.""Our goal with Phyllo is to enable these developers and companies to focus on their core business, achieve data coverage over hundreds of creator platforms and go to market in the fastest way possible,"" Bhiwal said.Phyllo launched its product in January 2022.

Venture debt marketplace 8vdx to offer cross-border loans to startups,17 August,"Venture debt marketplace 8vdx is expanding operations to international markets like Singapore, the United Kingdom and Australia as demand for debt financing, especially in local currency, soars across the globe amid a “funding winter”.The company aims to offer cross-border venture debt to startups through local entities in the new geographies.“Startups are having trouble raising funding in the present economic climate due to the funding winter. This move will play a critical role in delivering founder-friendly finance,” founder Ravi Chachra told Moneycontrol.Startups can easily obtain venture loans through an intuitive interface and choose to repay in their local currency including the British pound, the Singapore dollar and the Australian dollar, Chachra said.To begin with, 8vdx plans to disburse around $1 million in cross-border venture debt to high-growth early-stage startups to bridge their Series A or Series B round of funding.Founded in 2021 by Chachra and Vijay Lavhale, 8vdx was part of Y-Combinator's winter 2022 batch. Y-Combinator is Silicon Valley's prominent incubator and startup fund.To offer debt in founder-friendly terms, 8vdX has the option of turning the debt into equity in case a startup is unable to pay the loan or continues to be a lender, therefore it does not seek personal guarantees from the founders or force startups to file for bankruptcy.“We aim to offer cross-border venture debt solution to the startups in these countries so that the founders can spend more time on their businesses and less time on chasing small ticket investors. Startups do not require the flip process in order to raise cash,” Chachra said.8vdX chooses startups for underwriting and funding approval using data-driven underwriting techniques that are driven by their KPIs' and growth metrics.It has funded more than 20 early-stage startups, including three from India and four from Africa, since its inception, the company said.The lender claims to have assets under management of US $10 million and is growing at the rate of 25 percent per week.“By 2024, 8vdx aims to fund 100 startups in these countries with an AUM of $200 million…we invested in 21 companies but already signed up 3 companies through this cross-border financing,” Chachra said.Lavhale said there are some regulatory barriers to offering cross-border debt like lending regulations, licensing issues, forex-related rules, which differ from country to country.“Offshore debt is complicated, you need dedicated experts to handle this. The government and Reserve Bank of India (RBI) recently came up with this framework of lending to startups offshore through convertible notes…so we need experts and experience to know the nuances,” he said.The lender recently launched a $75 million fund through which the cross-border debt will be offered, Chachra said.8vdx in May raised $3 million in a seed round from Y Combinator along with GMO Venture Partners, Zillionize, Cathexis, Grant Park, Asymmetry Ventures, Earlsfield Capital Partners and Fox Ventures.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/announcements/venture-debt-marketplace-8vdx-to-offer-cross-border-loans-to-startups-9043011.html,Funding,"Y-Combinator is Silicon Valley's prominent incubator and startup fund.To offer debt in founder-friendly terms, 8vdX has the option of turning the debt into equity in case a startup is unable to pay the loan or continues to be a lender, therefore it does not seek personal guarantees from the founders or force startups to file for bankruptcy.“We aim to offer cross-border venture debt solution to the startups in these countries so that the founders can spend more time on their businesses and less time on chasing small ticket investors.Startups do not require the flip process in order to raise cash,” Chachra said.8vdX chooses startups for underwriting and funding approval using data-driven underwriting techniques that are driven by their KPIs' and growth metrics.It has funded more than 20 early-stage startups, including three from India and four from Africa, since its inception, the company said.The lender claims to have assets under management of US $10 million and is growing at the rate of 25 percent per week.“By 2024, 8vdx aims to fund 100 startups in these countries with an AUM of $200 million…we invested in 21 companies but already signed up 3 companies through this cross-border financing,” Chachra said.Lavhale said there are some regulatory barriers to offering cross-border debt like lending regulations, licensing issues, forex-related rules, which differ from country to country.“Offshore debt is complicated, you need dedicated experts to handle this.",['Y-Combinator'],"['around $1 million', '$10 million', '$200 million', '$75 million', '$3 million']"

Bootstrapped SaaS firm Kovai.co mulls fundraise in next 18 months,10 August,"Bootstrapped for more than a decade now, Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) startup Kovai.co is in talks with external investors for a possible fundraise in the next 18 months.“For the next 18 months we have the budget in place and there is no immediate need for external capital…but post that if we feel there is a need to grow faster and we need a cushion, we will consider raising capital outside,” said Saravana Kumar, founder and chief executive of Kovai.co in an exclusive interaction with Moneycontrol. The company is receiving a lot of interest from external investors and Kumar is also having high-level discussions regarding the same. “There is no promise that the firm will be bootstrapped forever and I’m holding high-level discussions, which are at a very nascent stage, with investors and experts to consider raising funds,” he said. “I am trying to find out who will best suit us, want to be prepared, so we don’t have to rush for capital at the last minute, when we need it."" However, Kumar also reiterated that if their new products, Document360 and the customer success product Churn360, pick up at a faster pace and add more to the revenue, the firm will postpone the timeline to actively look for an external investor. Founded in 2011 by Saravana Kumar, Kovai.co is a Coimbatore and London-based SaaS firm that offers enterprise software products for Microsoft ecosystem. It counts ABB, Biocartis, Vodafone, Whatfix and Toyota among others as its clients. The firm reported an Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) of $10 million in 2020 and reported a profit of 40 percent of the revenue. Around 40-45 percent of the revenue comes from the US market, 30 percent from EU, 10-15 percent from Australia and NewZealand and the rest from other countries including India.However, in the past two years, the company has shifted its focus from profitability to investment and growth through which the firm has set a target to reach $30 million in revenues by 2025. “We were reporting around 40 percent of revenue as profits in 2020; however in the next two years we may not be profitable but the revenue generated will be invested fully into business development…We are operating as if like a funded company and plan to achieve $30 million revenue by 2025,” Kumar added.The SaaS firm consolidated its offerings recently and is focusing on four product segments -- BizTalk360 which contributes almost 70 percent of the revenue,  Document360, Churn360 and Serverless360. It closely competes with firms like Gainsight and Totango in the customer success product segment.“Churn360 is successful, up and running. We are seeing significant interest in the market. Customer success/retention is getting more attention these days as the market is witnessing a downturn and a fear of recession being set in,” Kumar said. The firm is going slow on hirings for the next year partly due to the focus on business growth and due to the external market conditions, he observed. “We recently shifted to an office with a capacity of 300 people and we are around 240 people now…Our focus has now shifted towards building our product and investing in the business and we have decided to go slow on hirings and do it only if it is absolutely essential,” Kumar said. ",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/bootstrapped-saas-firm-kovai-co-mulls-fundraise-in-next-18-months-8996721.html,Funding,"Bootstrapped for more than a decade now, Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) startup Kovai.co is in talks with external investors for a possible fundraise in the next 18 months.“For the next 18 months we have the budget in place and there is no immediate need for external capital…but post that if we feel there is a need to grow faster and we need a cushion, we will consider raising capital outside,” said Saravana Kumar, founder and chief executive of Kovai.co in an exclusive interaction with Moneycontrol.Around 40-45 percent of the revenue comes from the US market, 30 percent from EU, 10-15 percent from Australia and NewZealand and the rest from other countries including India.However, in the past two years, the company has shifted its focus from profitability to investment and growth through which the firm has set a target to reach $30 million in revenues by 2025.","['Moneycontrol', 'EU', 'NewZealand']","['$10 million', '$30 million', '$30 million']"

"WebEngage raises $20 million led by Singularity Growth Opportunities Fund, SWC Global",02 August,"Software-as-a-service (SaaS) startup WebEngage, which helps companies with customer engagement and retention, has raised $20 million in Series B funding as it looks to expand its footprint amid growing adoption.The financing round was led by Singularity Growth Opportunities Fund and SWC Global. It also saw participation from existing investors India Quotient, Blume Ventures and IAN Fund.A few family offices including Unmaj Corporation and NB Ventures as well as investors such as TVS Capital chairman Gopal Srinivasan and BharatPe co-founder Shashwat Nakrani also took part in the round.With this, WebEngage has raised a total of around $26 million to date. The company plans to use the funds to improve its product and make it more comprehensive, covering the entire spectrum of user retention.The proceeds will also be used to expand into new markets as well as go deeper in its existing markets such as India, the Middle East, Latin America and Southeast Asia and hire more local talent, WebEngage CEO Avlesh Singh told Moneycontrol on August 2.""The idea is to also build some of these inorganically and look for more capabilities that are available to add to our portfolio in the form of acquisitions and make it a comprehensive toolkit for our customers"" he said.Founded in 2011 by Singh and Ankit Utreja, WebEngage offers companies a suite of solutions, including a customer data and analytics platform, an omnichannel campaign manager and a web and app personalisation engine to help them retain customers and boost their revenue from existing customers.""WebEngage's comprehensive customer engagement platform truly empowers companies to listen to their customers better, to understand their behaviour deeply by smartly segmenting customers, and to act on that knowledge in a way that is personal,"" said Apurva Patel, Managing Partner of Singularity Growth Opportunities Fund.The company claims to have reached a $20 million annual revenue run rate, registering a 100 percent growth year-on-year.Covid boostSingh said that while revenues suffered a major disruption in the initial months of the Covid-19 pandemic, there has been a clear acceleration across enterprises to go more digital, which would not have happened or taken much longer otherwise.The startup claims to be working with more than 600 customers across the world including internet businesses such as Unacademy, Myntra, Pluralsight, Pepperfry, and Junglee Games as well as enterprises such as Adani Group, Unilever, L'Oréal, Bajaj Auto, IKEA, Grasim Industries and Go First.Singh said internet businesses are 80 percent of its customers, while the remaining 20 percent are enterprises.In terms of geography, India accounts for 60 percent of WebEngage's business, followed by the Middle East region that contributes 25 percent, Europe that contributes 10 percent and the remaining 5 percent is spread across Latin America and Southeast Asia.Singh, however, said the mix will likely change as they expand to newer markets.""Our product category is such that it is a necessary evil since retention is not something that you can shy away from. It is a second order problem when you have tons of money since you continue to acquire new folks all the time but especially in times like these, it cannot wait and becomes a first order problem"" Singh said.Privacy shift gains The company will also likely benefit from Apple's recent iOS privacy changes that require apps to get user permission to track their behaviour across other apps and websites.Google also intends to do something similar with the Privacy Sandbox initiative, though it recently delayed phasing out third-party tracking cookies from Chrome to late 2024.""When it comes into effect, the efficacy of what you are able to do on Google and Facebook's ad networks today because of third-party tracking will go down significantly, then the next best bet for you is first-party data tracking, which is all the data that you're sitting with (about) the user,"" he said.Anand Lunia, founding partner at India Quotient, said, ""We have always believed that the best teams build the best product and in the long run, it's the best product that wins.

"Tele-consulting platforms, e-pharmacies hit by tepid demand as pandemic boost wears off ",28 July,"Devlina Rishav Bose, 26, was living with her parents in Kolkata when COVID-19 struck India in 2020. In the initial days of the pandemic, Bose would visit local pharmacies to buy regular medicines for her family.As the city locked down, she and her family isolated themselves in their home to stay safe.“As the peak approached, I would call a nearby pharmacy and ask them to deliver medicines. But because of increasing demand, they hardly had the products I asked for or the staff to get them delivered to me,” she recalls.Bose and her parents then turned to online solutions, ordering medicines from e-pharmacies and, unable to meet their trusted family physician, consulting doctors on the internet.The pandemic exposed the gaps and under-investment in healthcare in India, but it also made way for a massive technology-led disruption in the way medicines are bought and doctors consulted in the country.That technology boost to e-pharmacies and online medical consultants is being eroded as the pandemic effect starts wearing off and people move back to physical pharmacies, trusted clinics, and hospitals.Moving back to offline healthcare  Take Bose, for instance. Now that she is no longer confined at home, she picks up regular medicines for herself and her family from a local pharmacist on her way home.“It saves me time as I have them in my hand instantly. Moreover, the pharmacy I go to offers me good discounts on bulk orders when I want to stock up on regular medicines once a month, and for smaller orders of Rs. 10 to 20, I don’t see any point in ordering online,” she said.And her parents prefer to meet their family physician in person.The preference for the offline model of healthcare, coupled with investors holding back funding in a tough global economic environment, is hurting start-ups.Over a couple of months ago, healthtech startup Mfine laid off about 400 employees amid a funding crunch and later merged with Chennai-based LifeCell International's diagnostics business in an attempt to focus on more profitable areas, its co-founder Prasad Kompalli had then told Moneycontrol.PharmEasy is in talks with investors to raise $200 million, but at a valuation that could be 15% or even 25% lower, cutting its valuation for the new funding round to $3.8 billion, a Reuters report said.During the pandemic, e-pharmacies and online consultation platforms turned out to be lucrative businesses within health tech, which also includes at-home diagnostics, fitness and nutrition platforms, disease management, and employee wellness services.Among e-pharmacies, Tata 1mg, PharmEasy, and NetMeds became popular. Patients used Mfine, MyUpchaar, Practo, and other platforms for remote consultations with doctors.To be sure, the pain e-pharmacies and online consultants are now feeling is not confined to health tech alone. This is a trend experienced by the ed tech sector as well after schools and colleges reopened.Moneycontrol spoke to consumers, investors and health tech experts to understand which segments of health tech industry risk being hit post-pandemic, and what entrepreneurs should do to receive investor interest in a bleak funding environment.Tele-consultation “According to our analysis of tele-consult usage pattern in the last two years, for most large corporate hospitals, at the peak of COVID-19, tele-consult reached about 50-60% of the total OPD (out-patient department) volumes. It has now come down to about 10-12%,” said Sunil Thakur, partner at healthcare private equity fund, Quadria Capital, and an investor in venture capital (VC) firm HealthQuad.Tele-consulting or tele-consultation refers to healthcare consultations carried out online. While a series of lockdowns left patients with no choice but to interact with their healthcare provider remotely, post-pandemic, those with issues that require physical intervention are heading to healthcare centres.“People have experienced that there are a few health issues that cannot get the best medical attention and advice online. There are serious ailments like cardiology, kidney issues or difficult to treat online like dental or opthal problems, and so on, and they are now opting for physical consultation,” said Thakur.Some patients and doctors are also preferring offline over online at least for the initial stages of treatment, as it provides a sense of comfort and helps build trust.“Many population types, especially the older generation, still believe that physical intervention can give them the best results instead of virtual interactions,” Thakur added.According to Dr. Pankaj Jethwani, Executive Vice President of healthtech VC firm, W Health Ventures, while tele-consulting start-ups provide digital access to healthcare, they don't inherently solve the supply issue.Data from IndiaSpend shows India’s doctor-population at a ratio of 1:1,404 compared to the World Health Organization (WHO) prescribed ratio of 1:1,000. The country has 1.7 nurses per 1,000 population, 43 percent less than WHO’s norm of 3 per 1,000.“Instead of meeting a doctor in-person, you're meeting them on a phone or video call, that's not inherently increasing the capacity of the system,” said Dr. Jethwani, who is a physician-turned-investor.He believes that there's also little to differentiate one telemedicine provider from the other.Tele-consulting companies providing standard services will not be able to protect their market share or profit margins and will be forced to diversify their offerings and shop around to grow and scale, added Dr. Jethwani.E-pharmacies E-pharmacies were among the most successful in the Indian healthtech market in 2020, clocking $700 million in revenue, according to a report by advisory firm RBSA Advisors.Prateek Verma, head of Tata 1mg, said when India went into a complete lockdown with only emergency services allowed in 2020, the e-pharmacy platform saw a spike of up to three times in certain categories. Post-pandemic, he said growth has moderated.He also said order patterns changed during the pandemic, when orders for medicines to treat acute ailments grew faster than those for chronic diseases, but have settled post-pandemic.“Products like self-testing kits, pulse oximeters, thermometers, masks, and a few other devices, during the pandemic, grew at a superfast pace compared to the rest. Their growth rates have decreased and have come back to pre-pandemic levels,” he added.Reaping rewards of the pandemic push However, according to Verma, due to the pandemic, there was a considerable jump in the total customer base on the platform.“Then the new base has started to grow at the same month-on-month rate it was growing before the pandemic. So what pandemic gave to the e-pharmacy platforms was a huge surge of new customers,” he said.Apoorva Sharma, a partner at venture debt fund Stride Ventures, believes these new customers will continue to use the platforms post-pandemic too.“It’s similar to what we saw in grocery delivery. COVID or no COVID, it’s saving the hassle of waiting in long queues in big supermarkets. Growth rate can diminish, but I don't think the people who were enjoying the convenience of online ordering are going to completely shift back offline,” said Sharma, who has led deals in both health tech and e-commerce.Mitesh Shah, co-founder of VC firm Inflection Point Ventures (IPV), agrees but also believes that Indian consumers have a greater affinity to the brand rather than the channel -- offline or online -- when it comes to pharma products.“Like in e-commerce, both the channels in pharmacy will also co-exist post-pandemic. Traffic will be driven to the channel that can offer brands according to consumers’ preference,” he said.Consolidation Moreover, these segments are highly competitive as during the pandemic, entrepreneurs flooded the space with investors pouring in funding.A report by London & Partners and Dealroom.co, published in December 2021, showed that the healthtech industry had attracted $1.9 billion in funding from venture capitalists last year.But investors believe the success of new ventures depends largely on the business models they build.“For the large number of players who have entered the market, the big question is – what is the model for scale? Discounting cannot be the model, especially in this funding environment,” said Dr. Jethwani.Data from analytics firm Traxcn showed that over 200 startups received seed-stage funding in the healthtech industry over the last two years.“There's a growing number of seed-stage digital health companies that are not able to raise growth rounds in the US. A few of these companies may wind down,” said Dr. Jethwani.He says that a few companies in India may follow the fate of those in the US.Shah of IPV says some of these companies entered the market with the wrong mindset. “We will see a consolidation within a lot of such me-too companies,” he said.Me-too companies offer standard services with business models similar to top players in the market.Ashish Venkataramani, a partner at Eight Roads Ventures, India, says differentiation in business models, unique products, and targeting niche segments is the way forward for newer companies to survive.“If there are relatively high-value, clinically differentiated offerings, they can automatically monetise it well; that's the strategy that I think many companies will take,” he said.High customer acquisition costs With intense competition, healthcare companies are spending increasingly more on acquiring customers who often don’t make repeat visits.Experts say these companies can also not generate sufficient revenue as the larger share of the actual value or the long-term value (LTV) goes to hospitals and clinics.“It becomes hard for many tele-consult companies to show sustainable unit economics in such cases,” said Venkataramani of Eight Roads Ventures.However, there are a few segments where companies can corner high LTV. One example of such businesses is management of a chronic disease like diabetes.“India is home to over 200 million pre-diabetics or diabetics. More patients are being diagnosed with this chronic lifestyle disease,” said Dr. Jethwani.According to a RedSeer report published in March, the disease burden in India is led by chronic conditions like diabetes, and hypertension, which accounts for 65 percent of the total deaths in the country, putting 400-450 million chronically ill people at risk.Dr. Jethwani said he believes health tech companies have the potential to provide long-term care that is almost impossible to deliver at scale in traditional clinics.“Even if you don't have high absolute LTV, your CAC (customer acquisition cost) to LTV ratio should be appropriate. If you're borrowing money for a low LTV model then it will not be sustainable,” suggested an investor with a leading VC firm, requesting anonymity.Not all doom and gloom According to a report by the National Association for Software and Service Companies and PGA Labs on quarterly funding in tech startups, while investment went down from $553 million in Q4 CY21 to $123 million in Q1 CY22, showing signs of a funding crunch in health tech, it has started to pick up again.The latest data from the report shows that the health tech industry received $275 million in Q2 CY22.In addition, VC firms like HealthQuad and Eight Roads, among others, have also announced healthtech and life sciences-dedicated funds worth $162 million and $250 million, respectively.“The sentiments are muted, and people are taking it slow, being cautious waiting it out. But I strongly believe that this will probably start getting better towards the end of the year because many VC funds are sitting on a lot of dry powder,” added Sharma of Stride Ventures.Moreover, experts believe the COVID-19 pandemic pushed healthtech years ahead, creating massive headroom for growth in a nascent ecosystem.HealthQuad’s Thakur said data shared by hospitals also shows that pre-pandemic tele-consult used to be only 1% of the total OPD volumes. So at 10-12%, it is still 10 times what it was in the country, pre-COVID.“People have now gotten used to technology,” he added.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/startup/tele-consulting-platforms-e-pharmacies-hit-by-tepid-demand-as-pandemic-boost-wears-off-8898651.html,Funding,"But because of increasing demand, they hardly had the products I asked for or the staff to get them delivered to me,” she recalls.Bose and her parents then turned to online solutions, ordering medicines from e-pharmacies and, unable to meet their trusted family physician, consulting doctors on the internet.The pandemic exposed the gaps and under-investment in healthcare in India, but it also made way for a massive technology-led disruption in the way medicines are bought and doctors consulted in the country.That technology boost to e-pharmacies and online medical consultants is being eroded as the pandemic effect starts wearing off and people move back to physical pharmacies, trusted clinics, and hospitals.Moving back to offline healthcare  Take Bose, for instance.The country has 1.7 nurses per 1,000 population, 43 percent less than WHO’s norm of 3 per 1,000.“Instead of meeting a doctor in-person, you're meeting them on a phone or video call, that's not inherently increasing the capacity of the system,” said Dr. Jethwani, who is a physician-turned-investor.He believes that there's also little to differentiate one telemedicine provider from the other.Tele-consulting companies providing standard services will not be able to protect their market share or profit margins and will be forced to diversify their offerings and shop around to grow and scale, added Dr. Jethwani.E-pharmacies E-pharmacies were among the most successful in the Indian healthtech market in 2020, clocking $700 million in revenue, according to a report by advisory firm RBSA Advisors.Prateek Verma, head of Tata 1mg, said when India went into a complete lockdown with only emergency services allowed in 2020, the e-pharmacy platform saw a spike of up to three times in certain categories.","['WHO', 'RBSA Advisors', 'Tata 1']","['$200 million', '$3.8 billion', '$700 million', '$1.9 billion', '$553 million', '$123 million', '$275 million', '$162 million and $250 million']"

Coinbase venture funding down 34% in Q2 of CY22,25 July,"Crypto venture funding, which saw a record Q1 in 2022, witnessed the deal pace of Coinbase Ventures slowdown in the second quarter, with the total count decreasing 34 percent, from 71 to 47. Coinbase Ventures is the venture capital arm of crypto exchange Coinbase.According to data released by The Block, venture funding in the blockchain sector declined 22 percent, from $12.5 billion to $9.8 billion. Before this decrease, investment had increased for seven consecutive quarters.A quarterly investment report released by Coinbase Ventures shows that despite the slowdown compared to the fervent pace of late CY21 and Q122, Q2 activity still increased 68 percent YoY, indicating overall growth in its venture practice.The decline in venture funding activity was attributed to the volatility in markets, which saw many founders rethink or put their rounds on pause, particularly at the later stages. “We’re seeing that many companies are foregoing fundraise unless absolutely necessary, and even then, only if they feel confident that they can show the growth needed to justify a new round,” the investing arm of Coinbase said.Web3 gaming will on board next wave of crypto usersWhile the overall environment has been negative, Coinbase Ventures is still interested in certain projects, as evident from its investments in Web3/protocol infrastructure, which got 38 percent of the VC's total investment and Platform & Developer Tool, which accounted for 21 percent.“With an estimated more than 3.2 billion gamers in the world, we strongly believe that Web3 gaming will on board the next massive wave of crypto users. Web3 gaming remained a sector of heavy investment in Q2, with The Block estimating that over $2.6 billion was raised,” Coinbase Ventures stated.CeFi Vs DeFiThe report noted that while centralised lenders indulged in opaque practices, and misused investors' funds resulting in their insolvency, these entities brought down whole crypto markets.

Byju’s struggles to close $800 million funding as investors balk,11 July,"Indian online education provider Byju’s is struggling to close a funding round of $800 million as a global technology rout weighs on valuations.Investors including Sumeru Ventures and little-known firm Oxshott haven’t transferred about $250 million of the targeted amount because of “macroeconomic reasons,” a Byju’s spokeswoman said Monday without elaborating.The two firms should come through by the end of August, she added. Founder Byju Raveendran however has completed an injection of about $400 million into the startup as part of the round, the spokeswoman said.The delayed funding for India’s most valuable startup is likely to trigger renewed concerns about India’s consumer technology industry, where public valuations on major players from Zomato Ltd. to Paytm have plummeted in recent months.

Startup funding declines 40% in April-June: PwC report,10 July,"Geo-political instability appears to be taking a toll on the Indian startups with the total funding declining by 40 per cent to USD 6.8 billion in the April-June quarter, reveals a PwC India report.The early-stage deals comprised more than 60 per cent of the total with an average ticket size of USD 5 million, as per the PwC India report titled, 'Startup Deals Tracker – Q2 CY22.'""After three consecutive quarters of raising more than USD 10 billion, the total funding in the Indian startup ecosystem fell by 40 per cent during Q2 CY22 to reach USD 6.8 billion. The decline can be attributed to a global slowdown, decrease in tech stock valuations, inflation and geopolitical instability,” it added. Software as a Service (SaaS) and fintech companies had the highest share of funding in the second quarter of Calendar Year (CY) 2022, totalling more than USD 3.1 billion, the report said.It further said that early-stage deals comprised more than 60 per cent of the total deal volumes with an average ticket size of USD 5 million. Funding in early-stage deals during Q2 CY22 continued to be stable at around USD 800 million and could remain stable or even grow in the next few quarters — given that entrepreneurial activity continues to flourish with increased digitisation as well as the quantum of venture capital funds waiting to be deployed in the Indian market, it added.""We expect the overall funding landscape to take 1218 months to stabilise, during which it would be beneficial for startups to increase their 'funding runway'. No matter which stage a startup is in, they would do well to keep a close tab on core business and ensure unit economics is strictly as per plan,"" said Amit Nawka, Partner – Deals and India Startups Leader, PwC India.Valuations are likely to remain under pressure across all funding stages, primarily trickling down from the significant funding slowdown in late-stage or Initial Public Offering (IPO) deals, he added. The report further said Bengaluru, National Capital Region (NCR) and Mumbai continue to be the key startup cities in India, together contributing around 95 per cent of the total funding activity in April-June quarter of 2022, followed by Chennai and Pune.In Bengaluru, more than USD 100 million was raised by seven companies each in the second quarter of 2022 — Dailyhunt, Rapido, Leadsquared, Lenskart, CRED, Ather Energy and Observe.ai — majorly across the SaaS, and logi and autotech space.

PE-VC funding rose 11% to $26.5 bn in first half of 2022: Venture Intelligence data,01 July,"Amid fears of a funding winter, private equity and venture capital (PE-VC) deal value rose 11 percent to $26.5 billion in the first half of 2022, compared to $23.9 billion in the year-ago period, according to data from Venture Intelligence.However, the average cheque size has decreased by 12.5 percent to $39.5 million even as the number of deals struck rose 27 percent to 667.The biggest startup fundraises this year to date have been Dailyhunt’s $805-million round, a $665-million round by Byju’s, and a $255-million tranche raised by ShareChat as a part of a $520-million round that started in December last year.The six months up to June (H1) have seen a few big bang private equity deals as well. Bodhi Tree, an alternative investments platform backed by Qatar Investment Authority, has led a $1.78-billion funding round for Viacom18 and a $600-million round for educational services company Allen.A $700-million fundraise by telecom major Airtel from Google was another large PE deal struck in H1.“There is generally a one quarter lag between when a large PE deal starts taking shape and it being finalised. There’s no doubt about the fact that most large deals have been paused until there is more clarity on how inflation pans out in the US and the impact of Fed action,” said a PE investor who did not want to be named.“Even in the tech sector, players like Tiger Global, Sequoia and Accel seem to have taken a backseat in growth stage deals. We are also waiting to see what happens in the US mid-term elections in November,” he said.The expectation is that if Democrats perform well in the polls, the Biden administration will ramp up government spending and borrow more. This in turn will encourage large US investors to allocate more money to US treasuries and pull out cash from emerging markets amid fears of an impending global recession.However, industry players say that early stage startup funding will remain relatively insulated from such effects in the near term.H1 saw 349 early stage deals with a cumulative value of $1.6 billion, according to data from Venture Intelligence. Interestingly, a few challenger funds have emerged in early stage this year as the largest dealmakers of last year have taken a breather in H1.While Better Capital, an investor in startups like Slice, Open, Bijak and Teachmint led by solo general partner Vaibhav Domkundwar, led the early stage pack with 30 deals, InfoEdge was the other surprise entry into the top five with 12 deals in H1.“Vaibhav is a rare investor on many counts. For one, he has been an entrepreneur himself. He has also seen the Silicon Valley models evolve up, close and personal. Therefore, he acts as a mirror for founders to help them understand how the Valley ecosystem would look at a business,” said Madhusudanan R, founder of M2P Fintech.Shifting sands of techAcross stages, SaaS was the biggest attraction for investors with 140 deals, followed by fintech (119), e-commerce (91), healthcare (58) and edtech (33).“Early stage bets on fintech are off at this point given all the regulatory confusion around RBI action. In the near future, investors might also stay away from e-commerce with last two years’ themes like dukaantech and social commerce not showing a lot of traction,” said a partner at an early stage VC firm.“We are however interested in looking at startups which want to build for ONDC integrations such as inventory management and logistics for e-commerce,” he added.According to industry players, one big departure compared to last year might be in terms of exits. While the first half of 2021 saw several IPOs like Zomato, Paytm, Nazara, CarTrade and Policybazaar being launched, logistics startup Delhivery was the only notable tech IPO in H1 this year.However, this year is expected to see a lot of M&A transactions taking place as a result of consolidation and lack of follow-on funding in segments like edtech and e-commerce.“Public market exits are certainly looking difficult this year. And otherwise, exits are going to be challenging. If there's no money at growth stages, then exits will become difficult,” said Padmaja Ruparel, founding partner of IAN fund.“I think this is a great time to buy companies, invest in companies as valuations are attractive. 2021 was very different but the foam has settled, the froth has gone. So valuations are more attractive and I think M&A activity will pick up this year,” she added.While the investment narrative last year was driven by growth and high valuations, the focus has now shifted to reining in cash burn and a correction of prices in the private market. “If you last for two years, there are tremendous opportunities out there. But you have to wait for that to happen and have to be patient, and so this is the time to build. And when we talk about winter, winter is not all bad right?,” asked Vani Kola, founder of early stage VC firm Kalaari Capital.“What happens in winter is everything slows down a bit, but the trees don't die and then spring follows and then you see what happens, greenery everywhere,” she said.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/pe-vc-funding-rose-11-to-26-5-bn-in-first-half-of-2022-venture-intelligence-data-8767421.html,Funding,"Amid fears of a funding winter, private equity and venture capital (PE-VC) deal value rose 11 percent to $26.5 billion in the first half of 2022, compared to $23.9 billion in the year-ago period, according to data from Venture Intelligence.However, the average cheque size has decreased by 12.5 percent to $39.5 million even as the number of deals struck rose 27 percent to 667.The biggest startup fundraises this year to date have been Dailyhunt’s $805-million round, a $665-million round by Byju’s, and a $255-million tranche raised by ShareChat as a part of a $520-million round that started in December last year.The six months up to June (H1) have seen a few big bang private equity deals as well.Interestingly, a few challenger funds have emerged in early stage this year as the largest dealmakers of last year have taken a breather in H1.While Better Capital, an investor in startups like Slice, Open, Bijak and Teachmint led by solo general partner Vaibhav Domkundwar, led the early stage pack with 30 deals, InfoEdge was the other surprise entry into the top five with 12 deals in H1.“Vaibhav is a rare investor on many counts.","['PE-VC', 'Venture Intelligence', 'Dailyhunt', 'Byju’s', 'H1.While Better Capital', 'InfoEdge']","['$26.5 billion', '$23.9 billion', '$39.5 million', '$665-million', '$255-million', '$520-million', '$1.78-billion', '$600-million', '$700-million', '$1.6 billion']"
Early-stage VC investments in Q1FY23 up 30% on year even as growth-stage investments come under pressure,01 July,"Early-stage venture capital (VC) investments in India rose by nearly a third in the first quarter of 2022-23 (FY23) from a year earlier as investors turned cautious and made smaller-sized and longer-duration bets amid a correction in global financial markets.In April-June 2022, early-stage VC investments in India (up to Series A rounds) rose over 28 percent to $1.50 billion from $1.17 billion a year earlier, according to data compiled by data analytics firm Tracxn Technologies. The data also showed that the average size of early-stage deals more than doubled to $3.94 million in the first quarter of FY23 from $1.92 million in April-June 2021.With central banks across the globe raising interest rates to tame soaring inflation, global financial markets have slumped over the last three months. Consequently, large investors are cutting their exposure to high-growth technology companies, and thus tech valuations across the world have been hit the hardest.Catching ’em youngVC firms, including some of the world’s most aggressive investors, including Tiger Global Management and SoftBank, have said that they will cut their investments this year. VCs are thus investing more actively at early stages, which are typically smaller deals and have longer-duration cycles.Moneycontrol had reported earlier this week that Tiger Global Management, one of the world’s most aggressive tech investors, had upped its Series A investments in India this year, in what was a shift in strategy for the New York-based Hedge fund company, which typically invests at later stages. The shift in strategy came at a time when the value of the company’s public stock holdings slumped to $26 billion at the end of the March quarter.“Over the last six-eight months, Tiger Global, Falcon Edge and all such funds, which have a hedge-fund approach, have gotten burnt very badly with the market coming down. So, they are going to be cash-strapped and are going to hold on to their investments. They might not stop, but I am given to understand that they might slow down their investments,” said Vikram Gupta, founder and managing partner, IvyCap Ventures Advisors.“And if you look at the bigger startup picture, out of the over 60,000 registered startups, about 25,000 have got angel, seed or pre-Series A funding. But only about 1,200 are Series A funded, and of those, 100+ have translated into being unicorns,” Gupta said.“So, there’s that huge potential for building many more unicorns. But there are challenges at Series A. You need conviction, cost is high, fund sizes are small, fund economics don’t allow you to hire good quality resources, among others. So, there’s a lot of gap at Series A and funds are looking to disrupt that, and so are we,” he added.Series A focusGupta’s comments come at a time when some of the world’s biggest VC firms, such as Sequoia Capital, Matrix Partners, Accel and Elevation Capital, which invest at early stages, have raised or are in the process of raising their largest-ever India-focused funds, suggesting more dry powder for early-stage investments.Sequoia Capital India, which recently raised $2.8 billion in a fund for Indian and Southeast Asian startups, has earmarked $300 million for early-stage investments through Surge, its startup accelerator programme. The VC firm also recently raised the ceiling for its seed-level investments through Surge to as much as $3 million.“Angel investing in India is exploding — there’s tremendous interest for Series A investments in India from institutional investors. India needs more capital. So, while we are caught in this notion of competition, we are still one-tenth in terms of venture investing in the world, so there’s obviously a lot of room for more capital to come in,” said Vani Kola, founder of Kalaari capital.“We should actively collaborate with this capital that is coming in, there are micro VC funds, which have a size of about $10 million, and they also have a role to play here because founders need capital at different stages of their companies’ life,” Kola added.Late-stage investments have lost paceLate-stage investments (Series B onwards), meanwhile, fell over 11 percent to $9.1 billion during the first quarter of 2022-23 (FY23) from $10.3 billion a year earlier, the data showed.The average size of late-stage deals, meanwhile, was little changed at $75 million in April-June 2022 from $77 million in the first quarter of FY21.Late-stage deals had fallen below the $1 billion-mark in May 2022 for the first time in about 12 months, but in June 2022, late-stage deals regained momentum, and topped $1.8 billion, the data showed.“I would say early-stage investments have not slowed down at all. I don’t know if they have picked up, but they haven’t slowed down at all and I don’t think they will slow down either,” Kola said.“Late-stage investments and growth-stage investments, in fact, have slowed down considerably. When you talk about early-stage investments, India has tremendous potential over the next 10 years, so we are very bullish and so are other investors, so I don’t think early-stage investments will slow down. We are looking to do what we did last year, investing about $75-90 million dollars across these deals,” Kola added.Padmaja Ruparel, co-founder of Indian Angel Network, meanwhile, said that she expects overall funding to slow down compared to last year but added that companies across stages that are able to project stronger financial metrics will be able to raise capital irrespective of the macroeconomic situation.“I would say what happened last year was unprecedented and that obviously won’t be the case this year,” said Ruparel.“But having said that, investors’ job is to invest so they will continue doing that.

Funding capital in Web3 space doubles this year to over $1 billion,30 June,"Funding capital in the Web3 space has doubled this year, in the first six months alone, according to data sourced from Venture Intelligence.The sector has already raised over $1 billion, compared to $0.5 billion in the whole of 2021, signalling continued investor interest in the burgeoning sector, despite the unfavourable macro tailwinds and funding winter.However, while early-stage deals have not slowed down, late-stage deals are taking more time, say experts tracking the space.To put it in perspective, last year, during the same period (January-June), the Web3 segment saw $60 million being raised. Seed and Series A deals took center stage, data shows.Top deals of the yearThe top deals of this year include Polygon’s $450 million fundraise, $136 million of CoinDCX, NFT marketplaces Rario and Fancraze raising over $100 million and SaaS startup Coinshift’s fundraise.The most active investors in the space include Polygon Studios, Sequoia, Coinbase, Woodstock, Better Capital, Alpha Wave Global and Tiger Global.Startups in the Web3 segment, where services are built on blockchain and are decentralised, usually raise funds in equity and tokens. For tokens, these startups sign on a ‘simple agreement for future token’ (SAFT) instead of ‘simple agreement for future equity’. The token economy has, of course, taken a hit after the crash of the crypto market over the last few months.This also comes at a time when startups are finding it tough to close rounds, raise growth capital and have started laying off employees. Over 10,000 employees have been laid off so far by Indian startups.“Last year, the activity increased towards the later part for multiple reasons. That momentum was carried towards the beginning of this year as well,” said Aashima Arora, who is investments lead at Polygon Ventures, which is the investments arm of Polygon Studios globally.Upward trend seen aheadWhile investments have slowed down, they are now seeing more quality in the market as the ancillary noise is out, she said.“Equity markets have 5-7 years of these cycles while crypto has 2-3 years. So we were anticipating this and are hoping that we will start seeing an upward recovery from later this year,” she said.“Bear markets are great for investing as you get great deals, great founders and hiring also becomes more qualitative. But most of the investors are still actively investing,” adds Arora.Reiterating this, another investor, requesting anonymity, said that early-stage deals are still happening while late-stage deals have slowed down due to the macro tailwinds.He adds that the startups which survive this bear market will have a solid product at the end.“There was a lot of noise over the last few months, with everyone busy organising meet-ups but no one was talking about how to build a product, community or teams. That is at the forefront now,” he adds.Meanwhile, even well-funded crypto exchanges that are also investing in Web3 ventures, are looking to reduce their cash-burn and growing avenues of revenue generation, as they grapple with declining trading volumes, which is set to fall further as the 1 percent tax deducted at source (TDS) will start tomorrow (July1, 2022).",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/funding-capital-in-web3-space-doubles-this-year-to-over-1-billion-8760251.html,Funding,"Funding capital in the Web3 space has doubled this year, in the first six months alone, according to data sourced from Venture Intelligence.The sector has already raised over $1 billion, compared to $0.5 billion in the whole of 2021, signalling continued investor interest in the burgeoning sector, despite the unfavourable macro tailwinds and funding winter.However, while early-stage deals have not slowed down, late-stage deals are taking more time, say experts tracking the space.To put it in perspective, last year, during the same period (January-June), the Web3 segment saw $60 million being raised.But most of the investors are still actively investing,” adds Arora.Reiterating this, another investor, requesting anonymity, said that early-stage deals are still happening while late-stage deals have slowed down due to the macro tailwinds.He adds that the startups which survive this bear market will have a solid product at the end.“There was a lot of noise over the last few months, with everyone busy organising meet-ups but no one was talking about how to build a product, community or teams.",['Venture Intelligence'],"['over $1 billion', '$0.5 billion', '$60 million', '$450 million', '$136 million', 'over $100 million']"

Tea cafe chain Chaayos gulps $53 million in Series C funding led by Alpha Wave Ventures,23 June,"Homegrown tea-focused cafe chain Chaayos has raised $53 million as a part of its Series C funding round led by Alpha Wave Ventures as the Tiger Global-backed company looks to capitalise on the rising demand for restaurants and cafes with the Covid-19 situation normalising in most parts of the country.Chaayos’ existing investors including Elevation Capital, Tiger Global and Think Investments also participated in the current round, the company said in a statement on June 23.

It helps universities launch, run and manage online programs, improve the employability of students through skilling and help companies upskill and reskill their workforce.Also read: Layoffs, restructuring, slowdown: India’s edtech firms struggle after CovidIPO planTeamLease Edtech is an independent legal entity within the TeamLease Group, said Rooj.“For us the model to look at is, let’s say the HDFC model, each group firm looking at a growth path, listing, etc. TeamLease Edtech is gearing for that,” he said.The listing is likely in the next three to four years, said Rooj, adding that TeamLease Edtech would grow between five to six times over the next four years. It is also looking to become a Rs 1,000 crore revenue company ahead of the listing.Neeti Sharma, president and co-founder of TeamLease Edtech said, the company would add more staff to fuel growth. The firm has around 280 employees, which will grow to 400 over the next few months.The firm is hopeful that the staff strength would grow significantly for the next couple of years before the listing, Rooj said. “While some firms are blowing hot and cold, TeamLease Edtech continue to stay warm and grow profitably.”Also read: Startups to prioritise performance marketing over brand buildingGrowth pathSharma said since the firm was profitable and generating cash, it didn’t need funds for day-to-day operations but to accelerate growth.“The funding that we are planning to raise will accelerate the growth path.

Moneycontrol Masterclass | No funding winter for startups but only 'kaalchakra' which founders will have to go through,03 June,"The much talked about funding winter for Indian startups is just a kaalchakra (time cycle) that may not last for more than nine months, with things improving soon, said investors and founders in the latest episode of Moneycontrol Masterclass.Speaking to Moneycontrol’s Chandra R Srikanth in the Masterclass episode, Anand Lunia of venture capital firm India Quotient said that founders of new-age technology startups have to live through this phase and the ones who keep producing and selling something everyday will not face any problems, even during tough times.“Indian economy will do very well, I don't expect revenue downfall in Indian companies at all. That's a big positive,” said Lunia.“India will not face negative revenue growth, negative valuation is irrelevant,” he added.Lunia’s comments come at a time when venture capital and private equity funding to Indian startups is drying up amid a slowdown in global financial markets. The slowdown has also hit valuations of many high-growth technology companies across the globe. Many startups are finding it difficult to raise funds, especially at later stages.“If you are a company that was planning to raise your next round in 6-8 months then you're in trouble. If you have already raised you are safe,” said K Ganesh, promoter, BigBasket and Protea Medical.“I don't think this will last longer than nine months. I wouldn't call it winter, I would call it slightly chilly weather,” he added.Startups have also resorted to cost-cutting initiatives including mass layoffs, reducing marketing spends, and shutting non-core verticals among others to prepare a runway for the near to medium term.“This is the time to focus and build your business because there is very little hype going around. Obviously subject to the caveat if you have at least 12 months runway,” said Ganesh.Corroborating the comments, Sanjeev Bhikhchandani, founder of one of India’s oldest internet companies, which has invested in new-age startups like Zomato and Policybazaar, said that he is advising founders to reduce cash burn and focus on building stronger unit economics.“Companies where growth is lagging, burn is high and unit economics is not great, they have to accelerate the breakeven deadline. It may not be easy for some,” said Bhikhchandani.“We are not advising anyone to shutdown. We are advising people to conserve cash and somehow get to unit economics and raise money,” Bhikhchandani added.Incidentally, two of Info Edge's investee companies, recently laid off over 200 employees. While Udayy, an edtech firm shut down its operations and laid off over 100 employees, Yojak, a business-to-business (B2B) marketplace, scaled down its India operations, laying off over 140 employees.However, Bhikhchandani is not the only investor to advise startups to cut burn and focus on stronger unit economics and profitability. Many venture capital firms, including some of the biggest globally, have recently sent out letters to their portfolio founders asking them to reduce extra burn and to build a runway for 18 to 24 months.“There are a lot of memos which make you sit up and think. And India’s startups are not as mature as the US. Lot of us have grown in the last 3-4 years so people are seeing out to understand, how to respond,” said Ashwini Mohan, founder and chief executive officer, Mad Street Den, an artificial intelligence startup.“Its a great time for India to get competitive. There is a great competitive edge for Indian companies if we build it righ in the next 12-24 months,” Mohan added.Venture capital firms including Sequoia Capital, Orios Venture Partners, Y Combinator, and Beenext, have also advised startups over the last three weeks to take money whenever available even at down or flat rounds.“Don't get emotionally attached to a valuation number. Raise capital at the best possible terms and move on,” said VT Bharadwaj, partner at venture capital firm A91 Partners.""There's a lot of fog in the air. It will take six to nine months for the dust to settle down and the funding environment to become clearer. Founders should focus on things like unit economics. Let's not try to predict how long the slowdown will last,” Bharadwaj added.Missed Moneycontrol Masterclass?

Exclusive: Curefoods closes its $50-million Series C funding round,01 June,"House of Food Brands Curefoods has closed its Series C round of $50 million from a mix of new and existing investors, according to people aware of the matter. The round was led by Winter Capital along with other investors including Chiratae Ventures and Accel Partners. With this round, the company has so far raised over $120 million in equity and venture debt. Moneycontrol has also learnt that the new funds will used towards the expansion of its acquired brands into new geographies and for acquisition of new brands.In its last round, earlier this year, the startup was valued in the range of $250-$400 million.Led by Ankit Nagori, Curefoods has been following a Thrasio-style model wherein it acquires mid-sized food brands. Nagori founded the startup after moving out of CureFit and has so far acquired a mix of small and medium-sized brands such as Juno's Pizza, CakeZone, Iceberg, MasalaBox, and White Kitchens, Homeplate. CureFoods did not comment on the development.In an interaction earlier with Moneycontrol, Nagori said that CureFoods aims to have 4-5 (40 percent of its business) national brands with a larger appeal (like desserts, Indian food, healthy food) and 10-15 (60 percent) regional brands, which will include a biryani brand, regional cuisines, and craft brands of that particular region.The Bengaluru-based startup competes with Rebel Foods, Biryani by Kilo, and EatClub (formerly known as Box8), which are at the forefront of this industry, and are building house of food brands.

"Forbes, chronicler of wealthy and powerful, will scrap plan to go public via SPAC",01 June,"Lauren Hirsch and Benjamin MullinForbes, the wealth-obsessed business publication, has decided to call off a deal to go public through a special-purpose acquisition company, also known as a SPAC, amid cooling investor appetite for the once-popular financial instrument, two people with knowledge of the plans said.The cancellation could be announced as early as this week, one of the people said.The deal, first announced in August, would have taken the company public at a $630 million valuation through a merger with Magnum Opus Acquisition, a SPAC based in Hong Kong. In February, Forbes said that it agreed to a $200 million investment from Binance, a cryptocurrency exchange, as part of the deal.SPACs, also known as blank-check firms, are publicly traded shell companies that raise money with the express purpose of taking a private firm public. Investor enthusiasm around blank-check companies peaked early last year but deflated after a number of SPACs failed to live up to their promises to investors.Regulators — including the chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission, Gary Gensler — have heightened the scrutiny of SPACs, and shares of many companies that went public through blank-check firms have plummeted.Forbes was one of several media companies that had hoped to tap the SPAC market to help fuel growth. But not all went ahead with deals, and some that did have struggled.Axios earlier reported the prospects for Forbes’ SPAC deal looked bleak.Shares in Buzzfeed, which went public through a SPAC deal in December, have tumbled more than 50 percent. Vice’s efforts to go public through a SPAC stumbled as investors turned on the market, and the media company instead looked to raise more money from private investors. There is also hand-wringing in the media industry over the state of the advertising market, especially after Snap Inc., the owner of Snapchat, said last week that its revenue and profit would be lower than expected this quarter.Some SPACs are still hunting for media deals. Executives from Group Nine Media, a publishing company that was recently sold to Vox Media, last year started their own blank-check company aimed at consolidating the digital media sector.Forbes has posted positive financial results since it agreed to be taken public by Magnum Opus, a sign that the cancelled deal could be a reflection of the souring market for SPACs. In February, Forbes said it generated $94 million of revenue in the fourth quarter of last year, a 51 percent increase from a year earlier. It made $18 million in profit for the quarter, an increase of 80 percent from the year before.Founded as a magazine in 1917, Forbes is known for its rankings of wealthy businesspeople. Last year, Forbes said it reached more than 150 million people with its journalism, events and marketing programs. The Forbes family sold a majority stake in the company to Integrated Whale Media Investments in 2014.Forbes still publishes a print edition eight times a year in the United States, and it has 45 licensed local versions that cover 76 countries.c.2022 The New York Times Company",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/forbes-chronicler-of-wealthy-and-powerful-will-scrap-plan-to-go-public-via-spac-8619771.html,Funding,"Lauren Hirsch and Benjamin MullinForbes, the wealth-obsessed business publication, has decided to call off a deal to go public through a special-purpose acquisition company, also known as a SPAC, amid cooling investor appetite for the once-popular financial instrument, two people with knowledge of the plans said.The cancellation could be announced as early as this week, one of the people said.The deal, first announced in August, would have taken the company public at a $630 million valuation through a merger with Magnum Opus Acquisition, a SPAC based in Hong Kong.Investor enthusiasm around blank-check companies peaked early last year but deflated after a number of SPACs failed to live up to their promises to investors.Regulators — including the chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission, Gary Gensler — have heightened the scrutiny of SPACs, and shares of many companies that went public through blank-check firms have plummeted.Forbes was one of several media companies that had hoped to tap the SPAC market to help fuel growth.","['SPAC', 'Magnum Opus Acquisition', 'SPAC', 'the Securities and Exchange Commission', 'SPAC']","['$630 million', '$200 million', '$94 million', '$18 million']"

A91 Partners, Elevation Capital and India Quotient also participated in the round. This comes at a time when funding rounds are taking longer to close, and companies have also resorted to shutting down non-core verticals, rationalising marketing and advertising spends, and gone on hiring freeze. Earlier in March, Moneycontrol reported that SUGAR Cosmetics is in talks to raise over $50 million at a valuation of $500 million, which is a 5x jump in a year. Altogether, the cosmetics brand has now raised $85.5 million. The D2C brand co-founded by husband-wife duo Kaushik Mukherjee and Vineeta Singh sells lipsticks, eyeliners, face and eye brushes, and recently expanded into the skincare segment, selling moisturisers and sheet masks.

"Former Policybazaar backer Inventus launches $120-million fund, rebrands itself as Athera",26 May,"Early-stage venture capital (VC) firm Inventus Advisory Services, one of Policybazaar’s first backers, which got a blockbuster exit when the fintech unicorn got listed on the exchanges last year, has launched its fourth fund with a corpus of $120 million fund (around Rs 900 crore).Inventus has also rebranded itself as Athera Venture Partners and said it will invest only in Indian companies through the fourth fund. Athera is a Sanskrit word that means ‘path’ and direction and the rebranding aligns with its focus on investing in the Indian startup ecosystem, the venture capital company said.Inventus has applied for Securities and Exchange Board of India’s (Sebi’s) approval and expects to mark the first close of its fourth fund in the next three to six months. The first close of a fund is a fundraising landmark for venture capital firms after which they start investing.“We have already filed for Sebi’s approval, a few weeks back, so it should happen sometime shortly,"" said Rutvik Doshi, General Partner, Inventus Advisory Services (Athera Venture Partners), in a virtual interaction with Moneycontrol.“In terms of being confident of being able to raise this amount, we've started talking to both our existing investors and some potential investors for the past few weeks, and despite the negative sentiment on the public markets, the kind of feedback that we received from our investors or other potential institutional investors, has been actually very, very positive. We should be able to mark the first close in the next three to six months and it will be somewhere close to the existing fund size,” Doshi added.Inventus will be making around 18 investments through its fourth fund and out this, 12 will be at pre-Series A or Series A investments in technology startups, Doshi said, adding that the remaining six investments will be in the seed stages or early for a pre-product market fit stages and those will most likely be in technology, and emerging technology sectors.“We remain a tech-focused fund. When I say tech focus, it's a broad definition of tech, in which, you build a diversified portfolio of consumer internet, B2B (business-to-business) SaaS (software-as-a-service), and some emerging technologies,” said Doshi.“That's our bread and butter, we'll continue doing that also,” Doshi added.Inventus Capital Partners was established in 2006 as a cross-border investing firm, investing in the US and India. In 2018, the company said it raised its third fund having a corpus of Rs 369 crore, which it claimed was oversubscribed. The third fund was India-centric, and the VC has invested in as many as 13 companies through it.Inventus has invested in 21 companies in India to date and has exited companies like PolicyBazaar through its IPO (initial public offering). RedBus, when it was acquired by Naspers, Sokrati after Dentsu acquired it, Instahealth with its acquisition by Practo, among others. Inventus has also invested in some other companies including HealthifyMe, Tricog, and Moveinsync.Inventus' launch of a new fund comes at a time when the Indian startup ecosystem is witnessing a slowdown with venture capital and private equity firms, including some of the largest in the world, are slashing investment commitments, due to rising interest rates, surging inflation and the on-going war in Europe. VC firms are also advising founders to cut and rationalise costs and are warning them of difficult times ahead.On May 25, Moneycontrol reported that Sequoia Capital, one of the world's largest VC firms, told its portfolio founders that the era of being rewarded for hypergrowth at any costs is quickly coming to an end with investors shifting towards companies who can demonstrate current profitability.“Ups and downs are part of the game, but the focus has to be on the fact that we are a 10-year investment company, we invest in companies and by the time we exit, it is somewhere between six to nine years,” Parag Dhol, General Partner, Inventus Advisory Services (Athera Venture Partners).I would say till you do so. So, to that extent, all of these crazy rises till December of last year or the current slowdown or whatever, are variations around what I would say is the secular mean. So, that's the focus that we are bringing to it,” Dhol added.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/startup/former-policybazaar-backer-inventus-launches-120-million-fund-rebrands-itself-as-athera-8576491.html,Funding,"We should be able to mark the first close in the next three to six months and it will be somewhere close to the existing fund size,” Doshi added.Inventus will be making around 18 investments through its fourth fund and out this, 12 will be at pre-Series A or Series A investments in technology startups, Doshi said, adding that the remaining six investments will be in the seed stages or early for a pre-product market fit stages and those will most likely be in technology, and emerging technology sectors.“We remain a tech-focused fund.VC firms are also advising founders to cut and rationalise costs and are warning them of difficult times ahead.On May 25, Moneycontrol reported that Sequoia Capital, one of the world's largest VC firms, told its portfolio founders that the era of being rewarded for hypergrowth at any costs is quickly coming to an end with investors shifting towards companies who can demonstrate current profitability.“Ups and downs are part of the game, but the focus has to be on the fact that we are a 10-year investment company, we invest in companies and by the time we exit, it is somewhere between six to nine years,” Parag Dhol, General Partner, Inventus Advisory Services (Athera Venture Partners).I would say till you do so.","['Inventus', 'Sequoia Capital', 'Inventus Advisory Services', 'Athera Venture']",['$120 million']

"Be conservative with hiring, capital will be constrained: Orios Venture Partners to investees",23 May,"Orios Venture Partners, an Indian technology venture fund, on May 23 advised its portfolio startups to become conservative in hiring as it said the capital will be constrained for the startup ecosystem amid the bearish mood of investors.“We can't say how long it will last but it's prudent to factor this (capital constraints) in for the rest of 2022 and possibly the first half of 2023 this situation will continue,” the venture capital (VC) company told startup founders in a letter.“Become conservative with hiring. Take in only essential people and negotiate on salaries. This is important,” the VC said.The VC’s comments on hiring come at a time when well-funded startups in India have laid off thousands of employees citing a funding crunch and a dip in demand after two consecutive years of hypergrowth. According to data compiled by Moneycontrol, so far in 2022, startups have laid off over 5,000 employees, with more than 2,000 layoffs happening just in the last week.Moreover, the letter follows a report by business analytics company CB Insights that projected venture funding to Asia-based startups to fall 31 percent sequentially in the April-June quarter of 2022. It also showed that venture funding to Asian startups fell 36 percent in the first quarter of the calendar year 2022 on a quarter-on-quarter (QoQ) basis.Further, the report suggested that mega-rounds to Asia-based companies will fall 25 percent sequentially in associated funding.According to Orios Venture Partners, the reason behind the funding crunch are overall weak global cues, hard lockdowns faced by a major supplier, China as it continues to battle covid, and sanctions on Russia due to the Ukraine war, among others. In addition, Russia has blocked the Black Sea, preventing Ukraine, a major supplier of Wheat from exporting. All these factors have contributed to the shortage of supplies and price hikes.“In such times, cash is king,” the VC firm said and asked founders to try and generate margins from sales as that will result in more cash.Orios also suggested startups to have a relook at the burn and finding ways to optimize it, by reducing customer acquisition cost (CAC), and fixed costs, among other things, if there is room for that.The VC further suggested that companies should reassess their working capital, and try to reduce it by negotiating with sellers and buyers.The fund also suggested founders consider borrowing as an alternative method of raising capital. “A good debt-to-equity ratio is always healthy, more so in these times where equity capital is constrained. Negotiate and shop around to get competitive interest rates,” Orios said.The VC firm suggested employees who earn more than Rs 60 lakh a year to consider taking a part deferment in salary.Orios Venture Partners also advised founders of its portfolio companies to close deals with investors and avoid waiting for better offers as there might not be any.“If you have term sheets from investors, don't hold out for better deals and close them asap. The next deal may be a worse deal or no deal at all,” the VC fund said.In the letter, the VC fund said that the rest of 2022 looks like a period of headwinds for capital availability. They explained that VC and Initial Public Offering (IPO) capital would be scarce. Orios has backed companies like IPO-bound Pharmeasy, Druva Software, Mobikwik, Zostel, and Ola among others.Last week, in a similar letter to its portfolio founders, marquee Silicon Valley startup incubator Y Combinator said the economic situation does not look good and advised startup founders to take money from investors even on terms of their previous rounds, if available.The world is now facing galloping inflation, the most seen in 40 years and hence, central bankers are raising interest rates. According to the VC fund, due to the increased interest rates, investors reduce deployment to public markets and allocate their money to bonds; and leverage becomes costlier, driving down stock markets.Orios believes this, in turn, affects IPOs. With an effect on IPOs, VC and PE investors do not realise returns which has a knock-on effect on their further deployment, as per the VC fund.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/startup/be-conservative-with-hiring-capital-will-be-constrained-orios-venture-partners-to-investees-8559171.html,Funding,"Orios Venture Partners, an Indian technology venture fund, on May 23 advised its portfolio startups to become conservative in hiring as it said the capital will be constrained for the startup ecosystem amid the bearish mood of investors.“We can't say how long it will last but it's prudent to factor this (capital constraints) in for the rest of 2022 and possibly the first half of 2023 this situation will continue,” the venture capital (VC) company told startup founders in a letter.“Become conservative with hiring.All these factors have contributed to the shortage of supplies and price hikes.“In such times, cash is king,” the VC firm said and asked founders to try and generate margins from sales as that will result in more cash.Orios also suggested startups to have a relook at the burn and finding ways to optimize it, by reducing customer acquisition cost (CAC), and fixed costs, among other things, if there is room for that.The VC further suggested that companies should reassess their working capital, and try to reduce it by negotiating with sellers and buyers.The fund also suggested founders consider borrowing as an alternative method of raising capital.","['Orios Venture Partners', 'VC', 'CAC']",[]
Self driving vehicle startup Minus Zero raises $1.7 million led by Chiratae Ventures,23 May,"Minus Zero, one of India’s first self-driving vehicle startup, has raised a seed round of $1.7 million led by Chiratae Ventures and joined by JITO Angel Network, senior executives from NVIDIA, and Lyft based out of Silicon Valley, among several others. The funding will be primarily utilised for building extensive autonomous vehicle R&D infrastructure and expanding the team to get the vehicle out on roads. The team is eyeing a public launch of their first autonomous vehicle use-case in late 2022 to early 2023. The Bengaluru-based startup, founded by Gagandeep Reehal and Gursimran Kalra in 2021 while they were still students, uses a combination of camera-based vision and algorithms.TCM Sundaram, founder and vice chairman of Chiratae Ventures, said, “Autonomous vehicles are no more a thing of the future and need to become a reality now.”Reehal, chief executive and tech chief of the startup, said, “ With multiple patents in the pipeline, our proprietary approach towards self-driving mimics human intuition giving the software an ability to gain confident insights even with less data inputs. This enables robust decision making, which is crucial for safe navigation in scenarios where extrinsic factors like poor traffic infrastructure, rash driving, and harsh weather would have otherwise compromised the safety of the vehicle.

"Things not looking good, startups should take money even on previous round’s terms: Y Combinator tells founders",19 May,"In a letter to its portfolio startup founders, marquee Silicon Valley startup incubator Y Combinator has said the economic situation does not look good and advises startup founders to take money from investors even on terms of their previous rounds, if available.“If you don’t have the runway to reach default alive and your existing investors or new investors are willing to give you more money right now even on the same terms as your last round, you should strongly consider taking it,” Y Combinator said.The startup accelerator also advised its founders to cut costs and extend their runways before they are out of money. Y Combinator said that the economic situation is unpredictable but will be bad in the coming days.Y Combinator, commonly known as YC, said, “If the current situation is as bad as the last two economic downturns, the best way to prepare is to cut costs and extend your runway within the next 30 days. Your goal should be to get to Default Alive.”Default alive means staying on track to make a startup profitable with its current resources.Y Combinator also advised founders to ensure that their company survives, if they are not able to raise money even for the next 24 months. YC warned that the future fundraises will be ‘much more difficult’The startup incubator also told companies that are looking to raise funds in the next 6-12 months to reconsider fundraising as it said chances of them being able to raise funds successfully are ‘extremely low.’Y Combinator said the poor public market performance of tech companies is impacting venture capital (VC) investing. “VCs will have a much harder time raising money and their LPs  (Limited Partners) will expect more investment discipline,” said YC.According to YC, during economic downturns, even the top-tier VC funds with a lot of money slow down their deployment of capital, and lesser funds often stop investing or die.“This causes less competition between funds for deals which results in lower valuations, lower round sizes, and many fewer deals completed,” Y Combinator said. Investors also reserve more capital to backstop their best-performing companies, which reduces the number of new financings.The startup incubator’s comments come at a time when aggressive tech investors including Japan’s SoftBank Group and New York’s Tiger Global are significantly reducing their exposure to high-growth companies after the two venture capital firms reported record losses on their VC funds. Moneycontrol reported last week that SoftBank will be cutting investments in 2022 to a fourth compared to 2021.However, Y Combinator pointed out that economic downturns often become huge opportunities for the founders who quickly change their mindset and make sure their company survives. YC also said that startups could often pick up significant market share in an economic downturn just by staying alive.YC argued that this slowdown will have a disproportionate impact on international companies, asset-heavy companies, low-margin companies, hard tech, and other companies with high burn long time to revenue.Interestingly, it said that the number of meetings investors hold does not decrease in proportion to the reduction in total investment. “It's easy to be fooled into thinking a fund is actively investing when it is not,” added YC.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/startup/things-not-looking-good-startups-should-take-money-even-on-previous-rounds-terms-y-combinator-tells-founders-8541091.html,Funding,"In a letter to its portfolio startup founders, marquee Silicon Valley startup incubator Y Combinator has said the economic situation does not look good and advises startup founders to take money from investors even on terms of their previous rounds, if available.“If you don’t have the runway to reach default alive and your existing investors or new investors are willing to give you more money right now even on the same terms as your last round, you should strongly consider taking it,” Y Combinator said.The startup accelerator also advised its founders to cut costs and extend their runways before they are out of money.YC warned that the future fundraises will be ‘much more difficult’The startup incubator also told companies that are looking to raise funds in the next 6-12 months to reconsider fundraising as it said chances of them being able to raise funds successfully are ‘extremely low.’Y Combinator said the poor public market performance of tech companies is impacting venture capital (VC) investing.","['Y Combinator', 'Y Combinator', '’Y Combinator']",[]

The institute aims to accelerate fundraising by strengthening alumni networks and increasing engagement with corporates, philanthropies and high-net-worth individuals.“Despite the COVID-19 pandemic, the fundraising from alumni, donors and corporate firms has been increasing by over 30 percent Year-on-Year. The number of corporate firms donating funds to IIT Madras through Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) has almost doubled in the last five years,” according to IIT-M.Fundraising from CSR partnerships accounts for nearly half of the total Rs 131 crore raised in the last financial year.“We are grateful to all the alumni and corporate partners who have helped us through impactful contributions…IIT Madras is fortunate to have thousands of alumni invest both time and money to grow the institute. This group is crucial to the institute’s future development,” said Mahesh Panchagnula, Dean (Alumni and Corporate Relations) at IIT Madras.The funds raised have been vital in supporting infrastructure development, scholarships, chair professorships, research, and other key initiatives, the IIT-M said.Some of the older IITs including IIT-M are increasingly tapping alumni and corporates to contribute so that they can accelerate their growth, fulfil their desire to expand, pursue R&D activities, and rely less on annual government budgetary grants.Several of them have set up endowment funds and have become active in chasing a target. For example, IIT Delhi has a target to raise $1 billion in endowments.Even as IIT Madras spoke about its fund raising success, IIT Kanpur director and a team are in the US to talk to alumni, brief them about their growth path and seek their support.“I apprised the alumni about the recent progress and sought their help for the growth of the institute,” IIT Kanpur director Abhay Karandikar has written in a social media post.Rakesh Gangwal, the co-founder of IndiGo Airlines, on April 4 committed to contributing Rs 100 crore to the Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur (IIT-Kanpur).

"Zepto, a 10 -minute grocery delivery app, raises $200 million at a valuation of $900 million",03 May,"Zepto, a 10-minute grocery delivery app, has raised $200 million in its Series D round of funding at a valuation of $900 million, signifying investor confidence amid a slowdown in startup funding, and giving it ammunition to compete against larger rivals such as Swiggy, Dunzo, and BigBasket.The round was led by Y Combinator Continuity along with Kaiser Permanente. Existing investors including Nexus Venture Partners, Glade Brook Capital, and Lachy Groom, also increased their investments. Last December, the startup had raised $100 million led by YC Continuity for a valuation of $570 million.The startup was in fact looking to raise at a $1 billion valuation, which would have given it the unicorn status, but this didn't come through.Reacting to this, Aadit Palicha, co-founder & CEO of Zepto, said,  “Yes, there was a buzz, about a billion dollars. The reality is that we've created a $900 million company in nine months, which is an incredibly successful outcome.""On an absolute basis, making a $900 million company in nine months is a pretty exciting sort of achievement. While some can downplay it because it's some sort of artificial milestone, most people who know the internal process understand it.”“We closed this round in about 5-6 weeks. We obviously did this round post the war and the whole downturn in private markets. But what we've noticed is that the investors have raised their bar and have become selective now and the quality of the companies that they invest in is now very high.”Founded by two 19-year-old Stanford University dropouts – Aadit Palicha and Kaivalya Vohra – Zepto offers quick grocery delivery to customers through micro-warehouses. Palicha and Vohra, brought up in Dubai, are from families that had a background in business and dabbled with ventures early on. While in school they started up their first venture GoPool, a ride pooling app that was acquired by a Dubai-based firm.It will use the new tranche of money to expand operations, hire, enhance products and scale its newly launched offering ‘Zepto Cafe’. Moneycontrol was the first to report on April 18 that the Mumbai-headquartered startup has tied up with restaurants such as Blue Tokai Coffee, Chaayos, Gurukripa snacks, and Sassy Teaspoon to deliver snackable items in 10 minutes. Some of the items being delivered include tea, croissants, samosa, and coffee.Commenting on Zepto Cafe,  Palicha said that the company plans to enhance the core grocery experience, drawing a comparison with American convenience chain 7-Eleven, where customers grab a bite alongside groceries shopping. ""We want to bring the offline experience for our online customers, and this is an interesting category for us within our core business. We will be investing and expanding this.”He further said, “We plan to expand sustainably across the country. Our micro-markets are profitable so we will continue to do that. Currently, we are present in 11 cities which we plan to expand to over 20 cities by the next financial year,” said Palicha.  The startup is also hiring in marketing and operations apart from engineering, analytics, finance, and HR and has more than 1,000 team members now.Palicha added that the company has been clocking more than a million orders a week for some time now, with daily orders in the average range of 1.5-3 lakh a day. The company is aiming to clock an annualized revenue of $1 billion by the first quarter of the Calendar year 2023.Arguing against the criticisms around the 10-minute delivery model, Palicha said, “The faster you're delivering, the cheaper it gets. And you can do significantly more deliveries per item per hour, in the same amount of distance traveled, if you're delivering in short distances in 10 minutes, versus 6-7km.”“Operationally it's difficult to do. But, if you do it well, it is significantly cheaper, if you don't do it well, it will still be cheaper, but you might lower the customer experience. We're always gonna be working very hard to deliver as fast as possible because the faster we deliver, the cheaper it gets.”Earlier this year, Moneycontrol reported that Zepto held talks for a potential acquisition by online food delivery platforms Zomato and Swiggy. While the talks did not fructify, the fact that these conversations happened underscores the competitive intensity in the quick commerce space in India and shines a light on how larger rivals view upstart Zepto. While Zomato is riding on Blinkit for its quick commerce play, Swiggy is doubling down on Instamart, and recently invested in bike taxi platform Rapido, to widen its fleet network.After a blockbuster 2021, when the country saw as many as 44 unicorns getting minted with investors pouring billions of dollars, the pace of funding has slackened, due to weak market sentiment, tighter due diligence and caution in the backdrop of governance lapses at some startups.

Geniemode gets $28 mn in Series B funding from Tiger Global,28 April,"Geniemode, a Gurgaon headquartered B2B cross-border tech platform for lifestyle goods that was founded in May 2021, has received $28 million in Series B funding led by Tiger Global. Existing investor, Info Edge Ventures, also doubled down in the round.The new round has come within just four months of the company closing its $7 million Series A led by Info Edge.Geniemode works with buyers and manufacturers of furniture, home textiles, apparel, and accessories to streamline and take control of the end-to-end supply chain and has created a tech platform for buyers with end-to-end transparency of cost, based on MOQs, quality assurance, design library, and complete order management including compliance, tracking, inspection, communication, information storage library, and logistics, the company said in a release.The B2B tech platform leverages AI and big data to offer insightful, transparent, and hyper-efficient ways for companies to work with the right suppliers.Within a span of one year, Geniemode has managed to work with more than 150 manufacturers from India and Southeast Asia and has also onboarded several new buyers who have never procured from India from geographies like the United States, United Kingdom, Latin America, Europe, Australia, and work with several marquee international retailers.At present, the company is on track to hit $200mn+ in annualized GMV run rate by the end of FY23. With this capital, the team is reportedly planning to deepen its penetration in key international markets. It also plans to strengthen its supplier base across India and SEA.Geniemode has pegged the massive opportunity in just the home and décor segment in the United States at $100 billion as many US brick and mortar stores still rely on the traditional way of sourcing.Talking about the series B funding, CEO and Co-founder Amit Sharma said, “We are excited about this round of funding as we will be able to realize the next phase of our vision and multiply what's working for Geniemode. We intend to increase our global presence with new offices across USA, UK, and EU as we expand our sales and operations team.""The United States will be one of our key territories in the coming year and we will completely streamline our on-shore operations to solve the supply chain issues faced by all kinds of retailers and suppliers.""The funding will also help further strengthen our technology platform with new features and details.

Our platform empowers them with features, insights and supplier network that only big brands could afford, hence building a powerful and transparent supply chain within everyone’s reach” said co-founder Tanuj Gangwani.He then went on to speak about their earliest investor Info Edge Ventures doubling down in the round. “The fresh infusion of capital will be earmarked for international expansion, to build high calibre team and further build out the platform,” Gangwani said.Kitty Agarwal, Partner at Info Edge Ventures, commented: “We have been partners with the Geniemode team since inception and led their Seed and Series A in rapid succession due to very high conviction in the team and their excellent execution.They have emerged as market leaders in cross-border e-commerce for global buyers in lifestyle goods.

Licious invests $1 million in pet food startup Pawfectly Made,27 April,"Direct-to-consumer (D2C) brand Licious has invested $1 million in a Bengaluru-based fresh pet food startup, Pawfectly Made, making its first strategic investment. Earlier last month, Moneycontrol had reported that the company will be investing in strategic acquisition and widening and deepening the brand's reach.Arpita Ganesh, who had earlier founded online lingerie brand Buttercaps which was acquired by Amazon, started Pawfectly in 2020. Pawfectly will continue to function as a separate entity with its own production processes and supply chain.Speaking to Moneycontrol, Nichelle Kamat, vice president of category at  Licious, said the company will be investing in areas where Licious can integrate back-end and front-end operations as well as smaller brands in the ready-to-eat segment. “Pawfectly is a good strategic fit for us given the shared vision and synergies across the value chain. The investment will give us access to a unique consumer play and product portfolio that will complement our infrastructure.”Licious raised $150 million in Series F2 within six months of becoming a unicorn. The round was led by Amansa Capital, along with Kotak PE and Axis Growth Avenues AIF-I. Last year October, the company raised $52 million at a valuation of a billion dollars, making it one of the first unicorns in India's thriving D2C space.​Moneycontrol reported on April 26 overall funding in the D2C space has increased to $153.4 million this March quarter from $105 million a year ago.

D2C funding volumes flatline in March quarter as sector set to consolidate,26 April,"Overall funding in the direct-to-consumer (D2C) space has increased to $153.4 million this March quarter from $105 million a year ago, as per data from Tracxn. While the number of deals remains flat, the ticket size has increased. Major deals in the quarter under review include Plum’s $35 million round, BlueStone’s $30 million, MCaffeine’s Series C of $31 million, and DaMENSCH and Renee Cosmetics’ $16 and $10 million fundraises respectively.Experts say that the sizes have increased as more late stage rounds are being raised compared to early stage ones.“The overall venture funding scenario continues to be strong with more late stage deals leading to bigger cheque sizes,” said Sumit Keshan, managing partner of Wipro Consumer Care Ventures which has invested in MyGlamm and Ustraa.“The funding trend is likely to continue, which is also helped by China flow getting impacted. Domestic capital has also grown over the last few years, which would support the flow into the venture/startup ecosystem,” he added.Last year, D2C brands raised over $2 billion across 105 deals. D2C could be looking at a $100 billion opportunity in India by 2025, the investment banking arm of financial services firm Avendus Group said last year.Ashutosh Sharma, head of India investments at Prosus Ventures, said, “Launching a brand today is quite easy but sustainability is not as scalability is difficult. A lot of factors like creating a brand, uniqueness of the brand, how many customers you can resonate with drive the brand. While there is a lot of early euphoria, it dies down after these brands cannot keep fresh.” The industry expects consolidation this year as a number of D2C brands are flattening due to overall negative market sentiments and customers shopping offline after virus, say experts.“Bigger and mature startups are looking to acquire promising smaller ones as they see opportunity for rapid growth. There are also deals happening in Thrasio-style ventures,” said Keshan. “The early erstwhile startups now have ambitions to create a house of brands, which would lead to consolidation this year.”Startups like Mamaearth, MyGlamm, CureFood, Mensa Brands, G.O.A.T have already acquired a number of smaller brands and investors expect brands to continue building 'House of Brands' which will add to more consoldiation. Adding to this, Sharma said, ""When macro-economic factors were not favourable, not many such brands existed then. This is the first time that after the resurgence of D2C, such a situation arose. The binary outcome of building a brand is that you can find an acquirer who can build more of the brand.""Experts cite that sectors like beauty and wellness, apparel and accessories, and food will witness consolidation this year.Overall, Indian startups have raised over $10 billion in the first three months of 2022, which is almost double of $5.7 billion from 225 deals in the year-ago period.Top deals during the quarter include Swiggy's $700 million in January, Byju's $800 million in March, Polygon's $450 million in February, Uniphore's $400 million in February and Fractal's $360 million in January.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/d2c-funding-volumes-flatline-in-march-quarter-as-sector-set-to-consolidate-8411801.html,Funding,"Major deals in the quarter under review include Plum’s $35 million round, BlueStone’s $30 million, MCaffeine’s Series C of $31 million, and DaMENSCH and Renee Cosmetics’ $16 and $10 million fundraises respectively.Experts say that the sizes have increased as more late stage rounds are being raised compared to early stage ones.“The overall venture funding scenario continues to be strong with more late stage deals leading to bigger cheque sizes,” said Sumit Keshan, managing partner of Wipro Consumer Care Ventures which has invested in MyGlamm and Ustraa.“The funding trend is likely to continue, which is also helped by China flow getting impacted.""Experts cite that sectors like beauty and wellness, apparel and accessories, and food will witness consolidation this year.Overall, Indian startups have raised over $10 billion in the first three months of 2022, which is almost double of $5.7 billion from 225 deals in the year-ago period.Top deals during the quarter include Swiggy's $700 million in January, Byju's $800 million in March, Polygon's $450 million in February, Uniphore's $400 million in February and Fractal's $360 million in January.","['Plum', 'BlueStone', 'Wipro Consumer Care Ventures', 'Swiggy', 'Byju', 'Polygon', 'Uniphore']","['$153.4 million', '$105 million', '$35 million', '$30 million', '$31 million', '$16 and $10 million', 'over $2 billion', '$100 billion', 'over $10 billion', '$5.7 billion', '$700 million', '$800 million', '$450 million', '$400 million', '$360 million']"

The defaulting account should not be treated as NPAs and buyers’ CIBIL scores should be restored, the court said.Nearly 40,000 homebuyers are awaiting possession in Amrapali projects.On July 23, 2019, the top court cancelled the registration of the Amrapali Group under the Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016, and ousted it from its prime properties in NCR by nixing land leases for breaching buyers’ trust.Former group directors of Amrapali - Anil Kumar Sharma, Shiv Priya, and Ajay Kumar - are currently in prison following the Supreme Court’s orders.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/real-estate/amrapali-case-consortium-of-banks-will-release-rs-280-crore-to-aspire-supreme-court-told-8408861.html,Funding,"The Supreme Court on April 11 was informed that the consortium of seven banks will release Rs 280 crore to Amrapali Stalled Projects and Investment Reconstruction Establishment (ASPIRE) for the completion of stalled projects.Advocate Alok Kumar, appearing for the consortium of banks, informed a bench of Justices UU Lalit and Bela M Trivedi that Rs 280 crore will be released to ASPIRE so that construction activities undertaken by NBCC can function smoothly.Kumar also told the court that it must ensure that funds that are being released to ASPIRE be utilised for the completion of the projects for which they are meant for.The order is awaited.The consortium of banks is headed by Bank of Baroda.In view of the same, we hope that the Supreme Court will tie all the loose ends and ensure the availability of funding by the consortium in a smooth and timely manner,"" said Kumar Mihir, an advocate representing homebuyers in the Amrapali case.On April 4, the Supreme Court-appointed court receiver R Venkataramani had informed the apex court that the consortium of seven banks -- Bank of Baroda, Indian Bank, State Bank of India, Punjab National Bank, UCO Bank, Bank of India, and Punjab and Sindh Bank -- had executed the loan and other transaction documents on March 29, 2022, and had extended the loan facility for Rs 1,500 crore of which Rs 150 crore has been directly paid to National Buildings Construction Corporation (NBCC).Meanwhile, advocate Udhav Nanda, representing cricketer MS Dhoni, said that they had filed an interlocutory application seeking a direction in arbitral proceedings which are going on with the real estate group.","['The Supreme Court', 'ASPIRE', 'ASPIRE', 'NBCC', 'Bank of Baroda', 'the Supreme Court', 'the Supreme Court', 'Bank of Baroda', 'Indian Bank', 'State Bank of India', 'Punjab National Bank', 'UCO Bank', 'Bank of India', 'Punjab', 'National Buildings Construction Corporation']",[]

CoinDCX CEO Sumit Gupta: The best companies in the world are built in the toughest of times,19 April,"Gupta, who is also the CEO of the company, said that he expects disruptions in payment modes to be temporary. These disruptions began after Coinbase’s public announcement allowing UPI on its platform, to which NPCI responded by saying that it was not aware of any crypto exchanges using UPI. Banks since then have been more cautious about openly associating with crypto exchanges.“NPCI’s statement did make banks want to take it slow and now discussions are ongoing. But very soon we’ll see all of it going back to normal because banks fundamentally want to work with crypto companies,” says Gupta.With plunging volumes making it difficult for smaller exchanges to sustain, Gupta also believes that the industry will soon see a consolidation, perhaps even before the end of this year.Edited excerpts from the interview follow:This fundraising announcement comes at a very crucial time as exchanges are facing a tough time. Over the last few weeks, we have seen how trading volumes have dropped after the taxes and the payments fiasco. What’s the action plan going forward?Sumit Gupta: Yes, this is a very crucial time. The market overall from a regulatory perspective is going through ups and downs in terms of volumes. But I think when we look at the larger picture from a long-term view, all of this really does not matter. Ultimately, we believe that India is going to be the Web3 hub of the globe. And there’s so much development happening on the ground in terms of new entrepreneurship and from Web2 to Web3. On the fundraising part, CoinDCX has grown leaps and bounds in the last 12 months. We have gone anywhere between 20 times to 100 times in calendar year 2021, depending on the metric. In January 2021, we were at around 200,000 users and right now we’re at around 12.5 million. It’s just like a testament to our products. We have made buying and selling of crypto extremely simple, the kind of innovation we have done in terms of new products we recently launched with a crypto investment plan and so on. Eventually, we believe that the space is going to be regulated and India is going to come out as the winner and investors are going with that vision. We have investors who understand the space. They have seen these companies or the same story playing out in other geographies and they know that every country has gone through the same trajectory  I’ve seen and learned that the best companies in the world are built in the toughest of times. So, when times are tough, we actually solve for the worst, and then new things are fundamentally very strong. Overall, this funding round is going to give a good boost to the ecosystem. Where will you be deploying the funds because trading volumes are very low at this point? A lot of people have been saying that hopefully this is temporary. But we have no idea how long that may take. Plus of course the technology is still nascent and ever changing. We want to be at the top when it comes to innovation. We will hire more engineers. We will triple our engineering base from where we are, and focus more on technology innovation, so that we are ahead of the curve.How much do you plan to increase your employee base by?Neeraj Khandelwal: We currently have 400 people in the team, and we intend to take it to more than 1,000 by the end of 2022, including operations, engineering, compliance etc. There will also be a focus on content and marketing. Sumit Gupta: We are also planning to build an Innovation Hub, where we will look at how we can nurture the ecosystem, help developers, have learning sessions etc. The details are still a work in progress. Solving the issue of talent supply-crunch is also very important for the industry in general and we will work on solving that as well.We understand you already have a DCX venture firm and you have been investing into Web3. But, at the same time, these Web3 startups are moving away from India. Your comments.  I fundamentally believe it is the right policies and frameworks that can attract and retain this kind of talent. Eventually, in the long term, we all believe that India is going to regulate crypto, until that time we are self-regulated. But, India should definitely figure out ways to stop this trend.  ",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/cryptocurrency/coindcx-ceo-sumit-gupta-the-best-companies-in-the-world-are-built-in-the-toughest-of-times-8380711.html,Funding,"But very soon we’ll see all of it going back to normal because banks fundamentally want to work with crypto companies,” says Gupta.With plunging volumes making it difficult for smaller exchanges to sustain, Gupta also believes that the industry will soon see a consolidation, perhaps even before the end of this year.Edited excerpts from the interview follow:This fundraising announcement comes at a very crucial time as exchanges are facing a tough time.We will triple our engineering base from where we are, and focus more on technology innovation, so that we are ahead of the curve.How much do you plan to increase your employee base by?Neeraj Khandelwal: We currently have 400 people in the team, and we intend to take it to more than 1,000 by the end of 2022, including operations, engineering, compliance etc.",[],[]

"Web3 startup EPNS raises $10.1 mn led by Jump Crypto,Tiger Global, Polygon Studios and others",14 April,"Web3 startup Ethereum Push Notification Service (EPNS) has raised $10.1 million in its Series A funding round, with an average valuation of $131 million based on the market cap of their token $Push. Jump Crypto led the round, with additional participation from Tiger Global, ParaFi, A.Capital, Sino Global Capital, Polygon Studios, Harmony Foundation, Wintermute, Zee Prime Capital, Woodstock Ventures, DCX Ventures, Alpha Wave Capital, Zebpay, TRGC and iSeedVC.The round also saw investments from Web3 leaders Andrew Keys of DARMA Capital, David Silverman of Aave Companies, Ajit Tripathi, Mateo a Levy, Kane Warwick, Jordan Momtazi and Justin Moses of Synthetix, Aniket Jindal of Biconomy, Anton Bukov of 1inch, Sahil Dewan of Harmony, Jerome de Tychey of Cometh and Ethereum France, Sam of Journal du Coin.The Series A round comes with either a 9-12 months cliff for each investor along with 24 months to 30 months vesting. EPNS had earlier raised $11.42 million through its seed and Series A round. For the unversed, Web3 is said to be the future of the Internet, where the services are built on blockchain and are decentralised. This startup is building a communication layer for the Web3 startups as today’s methods of communication in this space are dominated by Twitter, Discord, and Telegram. As a result, smart contract version releases are missed, liquidation thresholds are not warned, NFT drops are forgotten, and vulnerabilities aren’t communicated well.“In 2019, we started researching to understand what is missing in the Web3 ecosystem, when we realised the communication part was missing. For instance, how you send messages on Twitter or WhatsApp. The basic form of communication is notification. This layer for wallet addresses needs to be built so that any decentralised applications (dApps) or smart contracts can send messages which are tied through the wallet,” said Harsh Rajat, co-founder of EPNS in a chat with Moneycontrol.EPNS launched in April 2020 when co-founders husband and wife Richa Joshi and Harsh Rajat built this communication protocol for Web3 platforms. The protocol allows users to send and receive push notifications on Ethereum. EPNS launched on mainnet as a multi-chain protocol in January this year. If one were to liken it to a Web2 service, it would be similar to Apple Push Notification Service, a platform created by Apple that enables third party developers to send push notifications.EPNS is available in the Apple Store and Google Play. However, it can be accessed by having a crypto wallet given that it operates on a blockchain.Rajat adds that although the name can be misunderstood, it is platform agnostic and open so any crypto project can use it. The protocol is currently being deployed on Polygon, and will be deployed on Solana in the coming months. The startup has already built a community of 1,10,000 members which is a crucial necessity for any Web3 project to thrive. The EPNS team will leverage the funding to expand the team and develop beyond the Ethereum ecosystem. It will also help EPNS push for faster adoption of the protocol, enhance the protocol and enable developers and wallets alike to integrate the protocol.Apart from their $Push token, the protocol will charge services that are sending notifications, on a monthly or a yearly basis. “The way we designed it, the revenue goes to the protocol. If you're a push token holder, 70 percent of the revenue goes to you. And 30 percent goes to all the crypto wallets that have adopted the token.”Since it launched in mid-January, EPNS has over 44,000 subscribers and is working with over 80 projects including the likes of Uniswap, Decentraland, MakerDAO, Gitcoin, Polygon, ENS, Dydx, Bancor, Defiant, Coindesk, Aragon, Notional Finance, mStable, Snapshot and more.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/cryptocurrency/web3-startup-epns-raises-10-1-mn-led-by-jump-crypto-tiger-global-polygon-studios-and-others-8362981.html,Funding,"Jump Crypto led the round, with additional participation from Tiger Global, ParaFi, A.Capital, Sino Global Capital, Polygon Studios, Harmony Foundation, Wintermute, Zee Prime Capital, Woodstock Ventures, DCX Ventures, Alpha Wave Capital, Zebpay, TRGC and iSeedVC.The round also saw investments from Web3 leaders Andrew Keys of DARMA Capital, David Silverman of Aave Companies, Ajit Tripathi, Mateo a Levy, Kane Warwick, Jordan Momtazi and Justin Moses of Synthetix, Aniket Jindal of Biconomy, Anton Bukov of 1inch, Sahil Dewan of Harmony, Jerome de Tychey of Cometh and Ethereum France, Sam of Journal du Coin.The Series A round comes with either a 9-12 months cliff for each investor along with 24 months to 30 months vesting.It will also help EPNS push for faster adoption of the protocol, enhance the protocol and enable developers and wallets alike to integrate the protocol.Apart from their $Push token, the protocol will charge services that are sending notifications, on a monthly or a yearly basis.","['Sino Global Capital', 'Polygon Studios', 'Harmony Foundation', 'Woodstock Ventures', 'DCX Ventures', 'Alpha Wave Capital', 'Zebpay', 'DARMA Capital', 'Aave Companies', 'Aniket Jindal of Biconomy', 'Sam of Journal du Coin', 'EPNS']","['$10.1 million', '$131 million', '$11.42 million']"
Real estate PE inflows shrank 32% last financial year as average deal size dropped 42%: Anarock,13 April,"Real estate private equity (PE) investments declined 32 percent in financial year 2022 partly due to the second wave of COVID-19 leading to multiple lockdowns in various parts of the country and serious economic disruptions in almost all industries, an Anarock Capital report said.The office sector drew the most PE accounting for 38 percent of investments, industrial and logistics sector 22 percent and residential just 14 percent, the report said.The financial year 2022 also saw a huge drop of 42 percent in average deal size, though still higher than financial year 2018.

Metabolic fitness platform Ultrahuman acquires LazyCo,12 April,"Metabolic fitness platform Ultrahuman, on April 12, announced the acquisition of consumer-focused wearable company LazyCo, known for creating the Aina ring wearable.Post this acquisition, LazyCo founders Apoorv Shankar and Yogansh Namdeo will join Ultrahuman to lead its hardware product development. Ultrahuman’s hardware development team will integrate LazyCo to improve its user experience and help improve global metabolic health standards, the company said in a statement.Ultrahuman will also leverage LazyCo team’s expertise to generate deeper metabolic insights and better overall health insights for consumers, it added.LazyCo was founded by engineers-turned-product-designers Shankar and Namdeo in 2017. Its flagship product was Aina Ring - an AI-powered smart ring designed to predict and automate daily tasks without the need to take the phone out of the pocket. The startup claims that digital tasks such as booking cabs, controlling smart home devices, activating SOS alerts, and taking phone calls, are much faster and easier through the ring.“Ultrahuman’s vision of making health more personalized and impactful for people syncs with LazyCo’s vision of building products that solve problems for people in the most effortless ways.

Indian startups raise over $10 billion funding in first quarter of 2022,01 April,"Indian startups have raised over $10 billion in the first three months of 2022 from investors, reflecting the sustained pace of funding deals in the country, despite worries that global headwinds could slam the brakes on the momentum.Startups raised around $10.5 billion across 329 deals in the first quarter of 2022, at par with the $10.4 billion investment from 315 deals in the previous quarter, but almost double of $5.7 billion from 225 deals in the year-ago period, according to the data shared by Venture Intelligence with Moneycontrol.While the deal volume is still going up, it is likely that a major chunk of these deals could be closed late last year and announced during the first quarter. The impact of the global headwinds in early 2022 along with a sharp decline in the stock prices of domestic and global tech companies on private fundraising are likely to be felt in the upcoming quarters.Venture Intelligence founder Arun Natarajan noted that while the quarter-on-quarter comparison in terms of startup funding is flat, there are multiple signs of a churn since mid-February.""With the steep decline in technology stock prices in the US as well as the newly IPO-ed Unicorns in India, the aggressive funding of late-stage tech startups witnessed in 2021 is likely to take a pause, with investors becoming more selective,"" Natarajan said.""On the positive front, the vibrancy in the early stage - both in terms of new sectors like Web3 throwing up new opportunities and trend setting investors like Tiger Global moving into this segment of the market - looks set to continue,"" he added.These comments tie in with what various stakeholders in the startup ecosystem have been saying in recent weeks, with deals taking longer to close and some late-stage deals coming under pressure from the funding slowdown.On March 31, Arpan Sheth, partner at Bain & Company, said that investors are likely to double down on larger rounds in quality assets and focus heavily on leaner unit economics - with a slower pace of deal-making and rationalised valuations.In a recent episode of Moneycontrol Masterclass, Madhukar Sinha, general partner at India Quotient, said that investors are increasingly focusing on the real health of the company and asking questions regarding metrics that were hidden behind the veil of growth.Bigger financing roundsData shows that financing rounds have also become bigger, especially in the early-stage rounds.The average deal size in Series A rounds has more than doubled to $20.3 million in Q1 2022, from $10.75 million in Q4 2021 and $6.48 million in Q1 2021 while the average deal size at seed stage was at $2.15 million in Q1 2022, as compared to $1.76 in Q4 2021 and $1.49 million in Q1 2021.There were 74 deals amounting to $1.5 billion at Series A stage in Q1 2022, as against 65 deals amounting to $421 million in Q1 2021 while there were a total of 133 deals at seed stage, amounting to $286 million in Q1 2022, as compared to 73 deals amounting to $109 million in Q1 2021.Bengaluru leads funding activityBengaluru continues to dominate in terms of funding deals, with the startups in the city attracting $4.6 billion across 121 deals in Q1 2022. Mumbai-based startups was a distant second with $1.46 billion across 47 deals in Q1 2022, while Delhi & Gurugram startups got a combined $1.03 billion across 69 deals in Q1 of 2022.Sequoia India was the most active investor in Q1 2022 with 24 deals, followed by Tiger Global with 22 deals and Accel India with 16 deals.In terms of sectors, e-commerce saw the most capital inflow at $3.22 billion in Q1 of 2022, followed by fintech at $2.06 billion and B2B Software (SaaS) at $1.98 billion.That said, the B2B software sector saw the highest number of deals with 81 deals in the sector in Q1 of 2022, followed by 65 in fintechs and 52 in e-commerce.Among the top deals during the quarter include Swiggy's $700 million in January, Byju's $800 million in March, Polygon's $450 million in February, Uniphore's $400 million in February and Fractal's $360 million in January.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/startup/indian-startups-raise-over-10-billion-funding-in-first-quarter-of-2022-8305151.html,Funding,"""On the positive front, the vibrancy in the early stage - both in terms of new sectors like Web3 throwing up new opportunities and trend setting investors like Tiger Global moving into this segment of the market - looks set to continue,"" he added.These comments tie in with what various stakeholders in the startup ecosystem have been saying in recent weeks, with deals taking longer to close and some late-stage deals coming under pressure from the funding slowdown.On March 31, Arpan Sheth, partner at Bain & Company, said that investors are likely to double down on larger rounds in quality assets and focus heavily on leaner unit economics - with a slower pace of deal-making and rationalised valuations.In a recent episode of Moneycontrol Masterclass, Madhukar Sinha, general partner at India Quotient, said that investors are increasingly focusing on the real health of the company and asking questions regarding metrics that were hidden behind the veil of growth.Bigger financing roundsData shows that financing rounds have also become bigger, especially in the early-stage rounds.The average deal size in Series A rounds has more than doubled to $20.3 million in Q1 2022, from $10.75 million in Q4 2021 and $6.48 million in Q1 2021 while the average deal size at seed stage was at $2.15 million in Q1 2022, as compared to $1.76 in Q4 2021 and $1.49 million in Q1 2021.There were 74 deals amounting to $1.5 billion at Series A stage in Q1 2022, as against 65 deals amounting to $421 million in Q1 2021 while there were a total of 133 deals at seed stage, amounting to $286 million in Q1 2022, as compared to 73 deals amounting to $109 million in Q1 2021.Bengaluru leads funding activityBengaluru continues to dominate in terms of funding deals, with the startups in the city attracting $4.6 billion across 121 deals in Q1 2022.Mumbai-based startups was a distant second with $1.46 billion across 47 deals in Q1 2022, while Delhi & Gurugram startups got a combined $1.03 billion across 69 deals in Q1 of 2022.Sequoia India was the most active investor in Q1 2022 with 24 deals, followed by Tiger Global with 22 deals and Accel India with 16 deals.In terms of sectors, e-commerce saw the most capital inflow at $3.22 billion in Q1 of 2022, followed by fintech at $2.06 billion and B2B Software (SaaS) at $1.98 billion.That said, the B2B software sector saw the highest number of deals with 81 deals in the sector in Q1 of 2022, followed by 65 in fintechs and 52 in e-commerce.Among the top deals during the quarter include Swiggy's $700 million in January, Byju's $800 million in March, Polygon's $450 million in February, Uniphore's $400 million in February and Fractal's $360 million in January.","['Bain & Company', 'Delhi & Gurugram', 'Accel India', 'Swiggy', 'Byju', 'Polygon', 'Uniphore']","['over $10 billion', 'around $10.5 billion', '$10.4 billion', '$5.7 billion', '$20.3 million', '$10.75 million', '$6.48 million', '$2.15 million', '1.76', '$1.49 million', '$1.5 billion', '$421 million', '$286 million', '$109 million', '$4.6 billion', '$1.46 billion', '$1.03 billion', '$3.22 billion', '$2.06 billion', '$1.98 billion', '$700 million', '$800 million', '$450 million', '$400 million', '$360 million']"

COVID-19 comeback seen in parts of United States as funding runs dry,24 March,"COVID-19 is making its latest comeback in parts of the north-eastern United States as the BA.2 coronavirus variant becomes dominant in the country, officials said, while urging Congress to pass new funding or risk the supply of future treatments and vaccines.The country is currently registering an average of 28,600 cases per day, down well below the last peak of more than 800,000 average daily infections, seen in January. COVID-19 deaths are running at around 900 per day — with a total of one million deaths from the disease expected within about a month.Also Read:  New COVID-19 cases in India hover below 2,000 for 5th day in a rowBut Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) director Rochelle Walensky told reporters there were early signs of a new wave. ""We have seen a small increase in reported COVID-19 cases in New York state and New York City and some increases in people in hospital with COVID-19 in New England, specifically where the BA.2 variant has been reaching levels above 50 percent (prevalence),"" she said.Wastewater surveillance, an early warning measure of rising cases, also showed a modest uptick of the virus in some communities around the country, she added.COVID-19 VaccineFrequently Asked QuestionsA vaccine works by mimicking a natural infection. A vaccine not only induces immune response to protect people from any future COVID-19 infection, but also helps quickly build herd immunity to put an end to the pandemic. Herd immunity occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population becomes immune to a disease, making the spread of disease from person to person unlikely. The good news is that SARS-CoV-2 virus has been fairly stable, which increases the viability of a vaccine.There are broadly four types of vaccine — one, a vaccine based on the whole virus (this could be either inactivated, or an attenuated [weakened] virus vaccine); two, a non-replicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of SARS-CoV; three, nucleic-acid vaccines that have genetic material like DNA and RNA of antigens like spike protein given to a person, helping  human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine; and four, protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombinant proteins of SARS-COV-2 along with an adjuvant (booster) is given as a vaccine.Vaccine development is a long, complex process. Unlike drugs that are given to people with a diseased, vaccines are given to healthy people and also vulnerable sections such as children, pregnant women and the elderly. So rigorous tests are compulsory. History says that the fastest time it took to develop a vaccine is five years, but it usually takes double or sometimes triple that time.The BA.2 variant does not appear to cause more severe disease than the original Omicron, BA.1, nor does it seem more likely to evade immune protection — but it is more transmissible. BA.2 currently accounts for 35 percent of cases nationally and is expected to become dominant soon.Also Read: Singapore relaxes more COVID-19 curbs: Masks optional outdoors, rules ease for vaccinated travellersThe expected rebound comes as Congress declined to add $22.5 billion in COVID-19 funding to a spending bill passed last week.""At this stage, our resources are depleted. The fund Congress established to reimburse doctors and other medical providers for COVID-19 care for Americans, in particular the uninsured, is no longer accepting new claims for testing or treatment services as of yesterday,"" health secretary Xavier Becerra said.On or around April 5, there is expected to be no money for new claims for vaccination services, he added.Supplies of monoclonal antibody treatments to states were cut by 35 percent, and the treatments are expected to run out by May.White House coronavirus response coordinator Jeff Zients added that in terms of vaccines, there was enough supply to give fourth doses to the immune compromised, and if authorized in coming weeks, to seniors. ""However, if the science shows that fourth doses are needed for the general population later this year, we will not have the supply necessary to ensure shots are available, free and easy to access for all Americans,"" he added.That would also apply to new variant-specific vaccines that may be required, Zients said, and ran counter to the strategy of prudently purchasing new supply as several other countries, including  Japan, Vietnam, the Philippines and Hong Kong have begun to do, he said.""Further congressional inaction will set us back, leave us less prepared, and cost more lives,"" he said.Find more coverage on coronavirus, health and world news here",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/world/covid-19-comeback-seen-in-parts-of-united-states-as-funding-runs-dry-8268371.html,Funding,"The good news is that SARS-CoV-2 virus has been fairly stable, which increases the viability of a vaccine.There are broadly four types of vaccine — one, a vaccine based on the whole virus (this could be either inactivated, or an attenuated [weakened] virus vaccine); two, a non-replicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of SARS-CoV; three, nucleic-acid vaccines that have genetic material like DNA and RNA of antigens like spike protein given to a person, helping  human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine; and four, protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombinant proteins of SARS-COV-2 along with an adjuvant (booster) is given as a vaccine.Vaccine development is a long, complex process.The fund Congress established to reimburse doctors and other medical providers for COVID-19 care for Americans, in particular the uninsured, is no longer accepting new claims for testing or treatment services as of yesterday,"" health secretary Xavier Becerra said.On or around April 5, there is expected to be no money for new claims for vaccination services, he added.Supplies of monoclonal antibody treatments to states were cut by 35 percent, and the treatments are expected to run out by May.White House coronavirus response coordinator Jeff Zients added that in terms of vaccines, there was enough supply to give fourth doses to the immune compromised, and if authorized in coming weeks, to seniors.","['RNA', 'Congress', 'COVID-19', 'White House']",['$22.5 billion']

Moneycontrol Masterclass: Slowdown in funding frenzy to impact late-stage startups more,14 March,"After a funding frenzy that led to 44 startups achieving unicorn status in 2021, and many others to grow their valuation multi-fold in the year, the question many are asking is whether the euphoria is now slowing down.Adding to the slowing pace are global tensions triggered by Russia’s war on Ukraine and rising oil prices, leading to caution among investors.Speaking to Moneycontrol’s Chandra R Srikanth in an episode of Moneycontrol Masterclass, angel investor and founder of neobanking platform Jupiter, Jitendra Gupta, said that the frenzy of 2021 has been replaced with rationality in the past one month.“That being said, the bigger India story is still at play with the internet ecosystem growing and consumer habits changing. While sentiments are more subdued, I think that will last only for 6-12 months more. Post that we will be back to the party,” he said.Madhukar Sinha, general partner at India Quotient, said that dealmaking has not yet slowed down.“However, what has happened in the past 45-60 days is that companies that have raised a lot of capital and were planning to raise again are being questioned on their business and rationality to raise funds again,” Sinha added.Investors are increasingly focusing on the real health of the company and asking questions regarding metrics that were hidden behind the veil of growth, he said.Tarana Lalwani, founding partner at Innoven Capital, said: “We need to see some discipline coming in, we need to start focusing on whether these business models make sense.”Over the past month, there has been chatter about deals taking longer to close and some late-stage deals coming under pressure from the funding slowdown. The industry sees a rational investing approach impacting late-stage startups more than early-stage startups. New entrants also have the backing of a host of new-gen angel investors.Sandeep Jethwani, co-founder of wealth management platform Deserv, said, “With interest rates rising, liquidity availability will reduce and deal closures may take longer. However, early-stage startups may not see much impact from investors as funding dries, but later-stage startups may be asked more questions.”With markets seeing a slump, investors have gone back to lower returns unlike the high-liquidity scenario seen in the past year. Investors have lost 30-40 percent of their capital and hence are evaluating deals based on investments in the light of the company’s revenues, profitability, etc.Moreover, recent incidents like the clash at BharatPe leading to the ouster of cofounder Ashneer Grover after a very public spat with the board and investors has raised concerns about corporate governance issues in new-age startups. Innoven’s Lalwani said that the incident may have an impact on the Indian startup ecosystem.“What happened in BharatPe is unfortunate and may have some impact on the Indian (startup) ecosystem. From a model perspective, an incident like this puts more onus on investors.

Exclusive | Shark Tank judge’s Sugar Cosmetics eyes $500 million valuation,01 March,"Sugar Cosmetics, co-founded by husband-wife duo Kaushik Mukherjee and Vineeta Singh, the latter of whom was recently a ‘shark’ on the viral series Shark Tank India, is in talks to raise over $50 million at a valuation of about $500 million, a 5x jump in a year, said people familiar with the matter, requesting anonymity. The round will be led by L Catterton Asia, an investment firm partnering with Louis Vuitton Moët Hennessy (LVMH), and manages over $30 billion in assets globally, the people cited above said.Sugar Cosmetics declined to comment while L Catterton did not respond to queries seeking comment.Sugar currently sells lipsticks, eyeliners, face and eye brushes, and recently expanded into skincare segment, selling moisturisers and sheet masks. It currently has an annualised revenue of about Rs 320-350 crore, or about Rs 27-30 crore of net revenue a month, sources said. The deal and Sugar’s surging valuation represent a sharp uptick in consumption as well as funding for new-age beauty and personal care brands, which start selling online and look to leverage social media word-of-mouth, online trends and a democratised internet to grow fast and expand offline later. These so-called direct-to-consumer (D2C) brands raised $2 billion in funding last year, trebling year-on-year, with the COVID-19 pandemic driving online adoption.A rise in online brands has however led to digital advertising costs, as Google and Facebook have started charging these internet companies higher rates to advertise on their platforms. Customer acquisition costs for these brands have surged 30-40 percent in the past 18 months, they said.“Sugar has built a good range of products and has become a distinctive brand. Now they have to maintain that differentiation when lots of new brands are coming up. And since advertising online is more expensive for everyone, they have to find new ways of attracting and retaining customers,” said the founder of a personal care brand, requesting anonymity.Also Read: Meet Shark Tank India judge who lived in 'matchbox house', ran marathon when pregnantNewer lipstick brands such as Renee, Belora and Gush Beauty operate at a fraction of Sugar’s scale, but pose competition going forward, according to sources.CEO Vineeta Singh’s newfound fame as a shark/investor on the entrepreneurship show Shark Tank may also help build out Sugar’s visibility further. Singh has over 500,000 followers on Instagram and Twitter, over 80 percent of whom have followed her in the last three months, while Sugar has nearly 2 million followers on social media, predominantly on Instagram.“Consumer brands need to find new ways of being discovered except social media ads. Her popularity definitely helps with that, although it should not prove to be a distraction, like investors sometimes fear angel investments can be. But they haven’t shown any signs of distraction so far,” another person said, requesting anonymity.Singh’s investments from the show include Heart Up My Sleeve, Booz Scooters, momo-maker BluePine Foods, energy drink NOCD and COSiQ Cosmetic.The deal will also mark new investor, private equity firm L Catterton’s first deal in India, after it hired Anjana Sasidharan from Sequoia Capital India to head investments in India and Southeast Asia last year.L Catterton was created in 2016, when PE firm Catterton partnered with Louis Vuitton owner LVMH and its billionaire chairman Bernard Arnault.

"Exclusive: Sequoia India eyes record $2.8 billion fund, MD steps down",09 February,"Sequoia Capital India has written to its US parent and investors to raise $2.8 billion in funds for Indian and Southeast Asian startups, its largest fund by more than double, signalling that India’s unprecedented startup funding boom may be here to stay, said people aware of the matter, requesting anonymity.Sequoia also plans to raise separate funds for India and Southeast Asia, something it has not done in the last seven years since it expanded to the region, these people said, in addition to venture and growth funds, a bifurcation it already makes. Further, former Uber Asia Pacific Head Amit Jain, who had joined the firm as managing director in 2019, will step down from his position. Jain will be an entrepreneur-in-residence going forward, working on his own venture but getting access to Sequoia’s partners, operators and networks before he steps out, people saidSequoia declined to comment on the matter, but confirmed Jain's stepping down in a Twitter thread after this story was publishedSequoia’s US partners, led by Roelof Botha will pitch to its investors (Limited Partners) next month- at a common event where investors in Sequoia commit money to all its funds- US, India and China (although China separately raises money from local investors too). Allocations are expected to be finalised by June-July, people saidSequoia India last raised $1.35 billion in mid-2020 for its seventh fund, when the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic was still raging, and its unexpected boost for technology companies was not yet visible. Since then, Sequoia has seen food delivery firm Zomato and software firm Freshworks list at eye-popping valuations, seen its holdings in Meesho, Unacademy and Razorpay swell and is expecting Southeast Asia’s GoTo (a merger of GoJek and Tokopedia) and payments firm Pine Labs to list this year. Even after Zomato and Freshworks’ share prices have fallen recently, Sequoia’s stakes in the duo are worth over a billion dollars combined, calculations show.It also sold stakes worth $700 million in companies such as Indigo Paints, Pine Labs, Vini Cosmetics and Stovekraft last year. Investors in venture firms look for exits/cash returned as a key metric leading up to a new fund, especially when exits have been few and far between for Indian VCs until recently.After the new fund, Sequoia will manage over $8 billion, more than any other VC fund in India by far.“Such a large fund not only makes Sequoia much stronger, but it also means other fund managers will find it that much harder to raise money, because LPs have a certain allocation to each market. So if an LP could have allocated $50 million across two Indian funds, that now goes to Sequoia alone,” a partner at a venture fund said, requesting anonymity to not spoil ties with Sequoia.Sequoia last year promoted five investors- Ashish Agarwal and Harshjit Sethi from the venture team; and Tejeshwi Sharma, Sakshi Chopra and Ishaan Mittal from the growth team- to partnership. The new fund will also reflect these investors’ increased compensations, both in terms of management fees- akin to salary- and carry, or their shares of profits when Sequoia sells its stakes in a company.After a venture fund’s expenses, the remaining management fee is distributed among partners- another benefit the new partners will get.However, Sequoia’s ambitions for a record fund also indicate its aggression and confidence in the Indian technology scene. A  top-performing $2.8 billion fund will be expected to return about $10 billion to investors, a size of outcome unheard of so far in India.Sequoia’s fundraising has also forced other venture firms to raise larger funds, as deals get more expensive, competitive, and talent cost has shot through the roof for most startups. Early Swiggy-investor Elevation Capital is raising a $600 million fund, while Matrix and Accel Partners are eyeing a $500 million and $700 million fund respectively, as per a CapTable report.Sequoia is however in trouble over one of its newer most successful bets. QR code aggregator BharatPe, once the darling of investors, is now being accused, along with its founder Ashneer Grover, of fraud, embezzlement and poor governance. Sequoia owns 19 percent in $3 billion-valued BharatPe, and managing director Harshjit Sethi is a board member.Sequoia US last year said it is moving to an evergreen fund, a radical move that does away with investment expiry dates and gives Sequoia the licence to hold on to company stakes for as long as it desires. Sequoia India however will not get this structure in the eighth fund or anytime soon.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/startup/exclusive-sequoia-india-eyes-record-2-8-billion-fund-md-steps-down-8060961.html,Funding,"Sequoia Capital India has written to its US parent and investors to raise $2.8 billion in funds for Indian and Southeast Asian startups, its largest fund by more than double, signalling that India’s unprecedented startup funding boom may be here to stay, said people aware of the matter, requesting anonymity.Sequoia also plans to raise separate funds for India and Southeast Asia, something it has not done in the last seven years since it expanded to the region, these people said, in addition to venture and growth funds, a bifurcation it already makes.The new fund will also reflect these investors’ increased compensations, both in terms of management fees- akin to salary- and carry, or their shares of profits when Sequoia sells its stakes in a company.After a venture fund’s expenses, the remaining management fee is distributed among partners- another benefit the new partners will get.However, Sequoia’s ambitions for a record fund also indicate its aggression and confidence in the Indian technology scene.","['Sequoia Capital India', 'Sequoia', 'Sequoia']","['$2.8 billion', '$1.35 billion', 'over a billion dollars', '$700 million', 'over $8 billion', '$50 million', '$2.8 billion', 'about $10 billion', '$600 million', '$500 million and', '$700 million', '$3 billion']"

Scrut Automation bags $3 million funding from Lightspeed and Endiya Partners,03 February,"Scrut Automation, a full-stack information security compliance platform, has raised $3 million in seed funding from Lightspeed and Endiya Partners.The platform plans to use funds raised to expand operations in the United States, European Union and Asia, and also improve its automation capabilities.Founded in 2021 by Kush Kaushik, Aayush Ghosh Chowdhury and Jayesh Gadewar, Scrut Automation automates a bulk of labor-intensive compliance tasks by integrating with cloud and software-as-a-service (SaaS) tools and automatically collecting hundreds of evidence artifacts, which would otherwise take weeks to collect.“Our approach is to combine technology with human expertise to cover even the edge cases, and thus offload most of the compliance-related work from the CTO’s table so that they can focus on building the business and not worry about compliance,” said Choudhury.A recent Gartner study showed that information security compliance is taking a center stage in most software ecosystems, and global end-user spending on information security and risk is expected to reach more than $220 billion in the next five years.Dev Khare, a Partner at Lightspeed, said, “We are excited to back the Scrut team given their deep combined experience of over ten years in information security and compliance management with over 3,000 assessments across every imaginable compliance use case.

Exclusive: Advertising regulator questions 10 minute delivery upstart Zepto over ‘potential violations’,03 February,"The advertisements regulator has questioned Zepto, one of the country’s hottest startups, over whether its ads in a newspaper promote rash driving by its delivery riders, said people familiar with the matter and documents Moneycontrol has seen.The Advertising Standards Council of India (ASCI) issued a show cause notice to Zepto, following a consumer complaint against a pamphlet ad supplied with The Times of India two weeks ago. “Isn’t it dangerous and not practical all the time? Dangerous because for achieving the time period the delivery person will take risk while riding on road as he/she needs to reach in 10 minutes,” the unnamed complainant is quoted in the notice, which Moneycontrol has seen.“We have received a complaint against Zepto; however, as the matter is still under process, we are unable to share more details at this stage,” an ASCI spokesperson said in response to Moneycontrol’s queries.Zepto, founded by two 19-year-old Stanford dropouts, is valued at $570 million and is less than a year old. Its 10 minute grocery delivery service already has investors jostling to fund it at a valuation of a billion dollars--making it a unicorn-- people said, requesting anonymity as talks are private. Zepto is eyeing a market where companies bleed millions of dollars a month in the hope that it can stop discounting and charge customers for delivery once customers are used to Zepto- a chimera according to its critics.SoftBank-backed Blinkit (earlier Grofers) directly competes with Zepto, while others such as Swiggy’s Instamart and Reliance-funded Dunzo have consciously stuck to more conservative delivery timelines, 30-40 minutes generally, and 15 minutes at the most, in order to avoid burning cash and chasing a market whose size or potential is unclear.“The 10-minute delivery timeline is a little hard to meet without either being disruptive on density where your stores are not going to make any sense or going ahead and really putting a lot of pressure on the delivery partners,” Dunzo CEO Kabeer Biswas told Moneycontrol in June.ASCI’s notice says that the 10 minute delivery ad promise could violate Chapter 3 of its code, which says ads should not “show or refer to dangerous practices or manifest a disregard for safety or encourage negligence"".In responses to Moneycontrol’s queries, Zepto said it is “committed to responsible advertising and consumer interests are always our top priority. The ""10 Minute Delivery"" promise is our core offering and our average delivery time is less than 9 minutes. The actual delivery time varies by location, traffic conditions, etc. and it is communicated upfront to consumers as soon as they open the app.”Zepto replied to ASCI last week arguing that its dark stores-- warehouses optimised for quick delivery-- are conveniently located within 2-3 kilometres in high density areas, due to which riders don’t ride long distances frequently, reducing road danger, a person aware of the matter said.Zepto may also amend its ads, saying that terms and conditions may apply for 10 minute delivery to be fulfilled, to avoid further legal issues, the person added.Usually such a notice demands an explanation, following which ASCI deliberates and rules on the ad. If ASCI rules against the ad, the company may amend or even remove the ads. An ad violating the code cannot be played on TV and faces other restrictions.Zepto, Blinkit and others are following a global chase for quick delivery, with Jokr, Fridge No More, Getir and others raising billions in the US and Europe based on the same promise. One of them, Jokr, lost $159 per order in New York City, a report from The Information said.Currently operating in Mumbai, Delhi, Gurugram, Hyderabad, Chennai, Pune, Zepto has captured the imagination of customers and investors, even as its ability to make profits and treat delivery riders equitably amid surging demand remain questionable.“Zepto is looking at 10 minute delivery as a unique proposition for it to stand apart from everyone else. They are offering a limited set of products with lots of dark stores nearby, so I think the ads are fair,” said Karthik Srinivasan, an independent senior advertising consultant.“There is no guarantee of commitment in their ads, unlike say when Domino's (Pizza) said 30 minutes or free, which created an issue. Unless they are penalising riders for late delivery, or saying if not 10 minutes, we will give you something, it shouldn’t be an issue,” he addedA Zepto spokesperson said it does not either offer delivery riders incentives to deliver under 10 minutes or penalise them for a breach over 10 minutes",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/startup/exclusive-advertising-regulator-questions-10-minute-delivery-upstart-zepto-over-potential-violations-8028791.html,Funding,"Zepto is eyeing a market where companies bleed millions of dollars a month in the hope that it can stop discounting and charge customers for delivery once customers are used to Zepto- a chimera according to its critics.SoftBank-backed Blinkit (earlier Grofers) directly competes with Zepto, while others such as Swiggy’s Instamart and Reliance-funded Dunzo have consciously stuck to more conservative delivery timelines, 30-40 minutes generally, and 15 minutes at the most, in order to avoid burning cash and chasing a market whose size or potential is unclear.“The 10-minute delivery timeline is a little hard to meet without either being disruptive on density where your stores are not going to make any sense or going ahead and really putting a lot of pressure on the delivery partners,” Dunzo CEO Kabeer Biswas told Moneycontrol in June.ASCI’s notice says that the 10 minute delivery ad promise could violate Chapter 3 of its code, which says ads should not “show or refer to dangerous practices or manifest a disregard for safety or encourage negligence"".In responses to Moneycontrol’s queries, Zepto said it is “committed to responsible advertising and consumer interests are always our top priority.and it is communicated upfront to consumers as soon as they open the app.”Zepto replied to ASCI last week arguing that its dark stores-- warehouses optimised for quick delivery-- are conveniently located within 2-3 kilometres in high density areas, due to which riders don’t ride long distances frequently, reducing road danger, a person aware of the matter said.Zepto may also amend its ads, saying that terms and conditions may apply for 10 minute delivery to be fulfilled, to avoid further legal issues, the person added.Usually such a notice demands an explanation, following which ASCI deliberates and rules on the ad.","['SoftBank', 'Swiggy', 'Reliance', 'Dunzo', 'Moneycontrol', 'Moneycontrol', 'stores--']","['$570 million', 'a billion dollars', 'millions of dollars', '159']"
"Edtech Scaler Academy raises $55 million led by Lightrock, valued at $710 million",01 February,"Bengaluru-based edtech Scaler Academy said on February 1 that it has raised $55 million from a clutch of investors led by Lightrock. The company was valued at $700 million. Existing investors Sequoia India and Tiger Global Management invested too.Launched in 2019, Scaler Academy is an edtech startup focused on upskilling college students and tech professionals. A press release from Scaler claimed that about seven out of every 10 unicorns in India now has a Scaler Academy alumni. In addition, Scaler Academy has partnered for placements with big names in the industry like Microsoft, Google and Amazon.“The cumulative annual salary of Scaler Academy graduates is more than Rs 600 crore as of today. If you factor in our expenses on teaching and infra, Scaler Academy enables the addition of more than $100 million into India's economy every year. Our next goal will be enabling the addition of a billion USD to India's GDP annually,” Scaler Academy and InterviewBit Co-Founder Abhimanyu Saxena said.With the current round of funding, the startup aims to pursue its international expansion plans, launch new product offerings and business verticals, make strategic acquisitions, and grow its customer base in India and globally.“Primarily, we will be using the funds for acquisitions, for few of which we are already in conversation. In the year 2023, we are looking at two-three strategic acquisitions,” Saxena said.Mentioning that the issue of shortage of tech talent is across borders, he added: “The product we offer is global. The funds we have raised, hence, are also for certain strategic advancements we want to make, in time, to become a global company. We will be starting US operations very soon.”Saxena believes that technologies like machine learning and data science will create a new kind of India powered by communication technologies like 5G that will have a far-reaching impact on the country's socio-economic status.“Today, we have an acutely inequitable higher education ecosystem where the top 15 percent of colleges drive millions to attempt an array of entrance examinations, whilst the bottom 85 percent have limited accountability. On top of that, the top 15 percent cater to those who can afford $11,000 or more, further restricting the country's ability to build a robust talent pipeline for the future.”He  thinks that higher education must shift from learning to skilling, from poor accountability to employability, and from physical communities to digital tribes.Saxena also said Scaler has grown 8-9 times in the last year and is cash flow positive, but did not elaborate further. “The team at Scaler Academy Academy (& InterviewBit) are building a learning community that is accountable for outcomes and designed for the future of work,”  said Divya Venkatavaraghavan, Principal Investor, Lightrock India.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/startup/edtech-scaler-academy-raises-55-million-led-by-lightrock-valued-at-710-million-8014521.html,Funding,"Our next goal will be enabling the addition of a billion USD to India's GDP annually,” Scaler Academy and InterviewBit Co-Founder Abhimanyu Saxena said.With the current round of funding, the startup aims to pursue its international expansion plans, launch new product offerings and business verticals, make strategic acquisitions, and grow its customer base in India and globally.“Primarily, we will be using the funds for acquisitions, for few of which we are already in conversation.On top of that, the top 15 percent cater to those who can afford $11,000 or more, further restricting the country's ability to build a robust talent pipeline for the future.”He  thinks that higher education must shift from learning to skilling, from poor accountability to employability, and from physical communities to digital tribes.Saxena also said Scaler has grown 8-9 times in the last year and is cash flow positive, but did not elaborate further.","['Scaler Academy', 'InterviewBit', 'Scaler']","['$55 million', '$700 million', 'more than $100 million', 'afford $11,000']"

The SoftBank-backed company had raised over $660 million till December last year.Ola Electric, which was spun out of the ride-hailing major Ola in 2019, has been facing a lot of backlash from customers after it started its deliveries in mid-December. Moneycontrol was the first to report on the issues which customers were facing including damaged vehicles with cracks and dents all over the body, lower mileage (range), delayed charger installations, and discrepancy in insurance policy among others.Last week, the company also announced that customers who bought the S1 scooter are automatically being upgraded to the S1 Pro, free of cost.In a press statement, Bhavish Aggarwal, founder & CEO, Ola said, “Ola Electric is creating India’s EV revolution and is driving cutting edge manufacturing from India for the entire world.

Swiggy raises $700 million at $10.7 billion valuation as rival Zomato sees intense selloff,24 January,"Food and grocery delivery platform Swiggy has raised $700 million at a valuation of $10.7 billion, doubling its valuation in six months, even as technology stocks were hammered in the Indian market on January 24.The investment makes Bengaluru-based Swiggy the fourth decacorn, a privately-held firm valued at $10 billion or more, to emerge from India after fintech Paytm, hotel aggregator Oyo and ed-tech firm Byju's.The $700-million round was led by Invesco, with participation from new investors such as Baron Capital Group, Sumeru Venture, IIFL AMC Late Stage Tech Fund, Kotak, Axis Growth Avenues AIF- I, Sixteenth Street Capital, Ghisallo, Smile Group and Segantii Capital, the company said in a release.Existing investors Alpha Wave Global (formerly Falcon Edge Capital), Qatar Investment Authority, and ARK Impact, along with its long-term investor Prosus, also participated in the round.In its last funding round in July 2021, Swiggy raised $1.25 billion from SoftBank Vision Fund II, Prosus, Accel and Wellington at a valuation of $5.5 Billion.Swiggy's fundraise comes days after Reliance Retail said it led a $240-million round in rival on-demand delivery startup Dunzo, giving India’s largest conglomerate access to rapid delivery, one of the country’s hottest startup themes attracting a bevy of investors.The quick commerce frenzy has caught wind globally, with startups such as Jokr, Getir, Gorillas, and others promising 10-minute delivery in cities from New York to Turkey to London.The new round of funding gives Swiggy the ammunition to strengthen its food-delivery business and double down on its express grocery delivery business Instamart, where it competes against Zomato-backed Blinkit, Reliance-backed Dunzo, new upstart Zepto.

"LTTS EV investment pays off, bags $95-million contract from US client: CEO Amit Chadha",20 January,"L&T Technology Services (LTTS) signed deals worth $95 million with a US-based automaker between April and December 2021 in the electric vehicle space, CEO & MD Amit Chadha has said, adding the company’s bet on EV is paying off.The EV segment, in which L&T Technology Services started investing 18 months ago, is one of the six areas the company is pushing to get to annual revenue of $1.5 billion by FY25.“Overall, the EV space continues to mature and expand. Our clients are talking to us all the time about software, hardware work, OEMs, and tier-1 companies in EV development,” Chadha told Moneycontrol on January 19, a day after the company reported its December quarter numbers.With an increase in the demand in the EV segment, the company would ramp up talent at its Poland centre over the next three years, Chadha said.All charged upOf the $95 million worth of work that the company got, it signed a $45-million deal in the Q3 FY22 and two $25 million deals each in the first two quarters.Considering that the orders came from a single customer, the company’s biggest bet—EV—was playing out well, Chadha said.The company started investing in the EV segment to win over new-age car companies to drive growth. It is also betting on 5G, med-tech, AI & digital products, digital manufacturing, and sustainability for annual revenue of $1.5 billion.LTTS will work with the US-based automotive company on both software and hardware development of its product line and at the same time, expand its centre in Krakow in Poland for servicing its customers.“I've been to Poland three times and I'm amazed by the technical skill set available in Krakow. We have already hired the head of Poland and will ramp up to about 150 people immediately. Then get to 300 people in the next two to three years,” he added.The company reported an 8 percent increase in net profit to Rs 248.8 crore for the quarter ended December 2021 from Rs 230 crore in the previous quarter.Its rupee revenue was up 5 percent at Rs 1,687.5 crore from Rs 1,607.7 crore quarter-on-quarter, while the dollar revenue stood at $225.1 million, up 3.6 percent from the previous quarter, and 18.4 percent from the year-ago period.The company retained the revenue guidance of 19-20 percent, missing analyst estimates.Chadha said the company was looking to improve margins in the media segment, part of telecom and hi-tech. The segment had legacy business and the company had taken a call not to renew them, he said. This would result in the quarter revenue for telecom and hi-tech being muted.“This was taken into account when we gave the 19-20 percent range and we are standing by that.

India’s startup and tech market has finally hit product market fit: Elevation Capital’s Mukul Arora,18 January,"In 2010-11, when Mukul Arora was travelling to Silicon Valley for work, he  felt wistful. The Northern Californian region's booming technology market was the hotbed of venture capital and ambitious startups, while in India things were just about taking off. For many venture firms in the country, SMS still represented cutting-edge tech.  Arora, a young executive with SAIF Partners then, used to feel the Valley had the real action, while India was playing catch-up. He couldn't feel more differently now. Arora, already a partner at the renamed Elevation Capital for five years, has been a part of some of India’s biggest and most successful startup stories - an early investor in food delivery firm Swiggy, online retailer FirstCry and commerce firm Meesho among others. His firm minted six unicorns-- companies valued at a billion dollars or more-- in 2021 alone. India too had a record 2021, with over $35 billion in startup funding and 43 unicorns being born, unprecedented in every sense of the word. Last week, Arora was promoted to co-managing partner to run Elevation-- which manages over $3 billion in India-- along with founder and US-based Ravi Adusumalli. Arora’s elevation cements his position as one of India’s most powerful and influential technology investors- one who sits on boards of $10 billion companies, dictates what trends will attract the next wave of investor dollars, and where India’s internet ecosystem is headed. In an interview with Moneycontrol’s M Sriram and Chandra R Srikanth, he spoke about the next big trends for the firm, judging a fund’s performance during a boom, and what separates Elevation from the hoi-polloi of venture firms and his views on Vijay Shekhar Sharma after Paytm’s flop IPO. The interview was edited for clarity.2021 was big for Indian startups in a way that no one expected. But it also accompanied fears of a bubble. Compared to other economies, where does India stand?We have to realise that while India is compared to China and the US for tech evolution, it is growing quite differently. In the US,  the economy and per person income grew first. And then the tech wave came; If you look at China, both happened parallelly. In India, tech has penetrated, everyone has mobile internet, and we are still at that $2500 per person income and the economy is going to grow. Now the tech rails are already in place.If you look at internet penetration in China, in any vertical- ecommerce, fintech, etc, it is 2-3 times of the US. In India, it is going to be even higher because people are already on the net. A  lot of businesses will just get built here versus first being built offline and then moving online. So the consumer-tech market has become much, much larger obviously. I don't think any of us expected we would have so many $5-10 billion (valuation) SaaS (software-as-a-service) companies coming out of India. SaaS is having its Flipkart moment. When Flipkart became that large, everyone saw the potential in consumer tech. Now you have a Web 3.0 and crypto, which is a level playing field for all countries. And given the quality of our talent, I think we have a great opportunity to actually leapfrog everyone else in that space.The other question people had was, these tech companies make GMV (gross merchandise value, a generous proxy for revenues) or they get eyeballs. But will they ever make money? And I think that has also been answered very, very strongly in the last two years because especially after that first COVID wave. When we were locked in at home, all the companies went hard after their cost structures and most of them became Ebitda-positive (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation) or contribution-margin positive.Now a lot of these companies are public. So now Nykaa is profitable, and that’s the start. In food delivery, both Swiggy and Zomato have healthy contribution margins in their core food delivery business. So that question is answered. Then there used to be a question that hey, in India, how do you get liquidity? There are no exits, only valuations keep going up. And in the last 18 months you have seen a very robust pipeline of M&As- 1mg, BigBasket, BillDesk, etc. And with record capital flows, I think the Indian tech market has now finally hit PMF (product market fit, a pivotal moment for any startup when its product is finally accepted by enough customers and it can now scale). The next decade is going to be growth. Now that all the enablers are in place, how do we really capitalise? Tech contributes 20% and 35% of GDP in the US and China respectively. In India, there is no published report but my sense is around 1-1.5%. And getting to lead a firm like Elevation with such a strong track record I can't thank my stars enough for being in this position.It is hard to say whether this year will be as active as last year for the overall market. See what we like to do, what fulfils us and excites us is to work with founders in really early stages, getting in super early and helping them get to PMF. And even today, I don't think a lot of VCs are actually playing that role very actively, if at all. What has happened is, as funds have become larger, focus on the early stage has become less, so people are doing a lot of investments. And then if they hit PMF, you double down on them. Whereas our focus is very, very squarely on saying that we will work hand- in-hand with you pre-PMF, and will help you get there.So when we are competing for deals, we tell them to talk to a few founders in our portfolio, who testify to the work we have done, so we don’t have to pitch per se to them anymore. Now that doesn’t mean I can make an investment at half the valuation of someone else. We don’t mind paying 20-30% to work with the best founders because we are working for really big outcomes. Mukul, how do you judge your fund’s performance today? The traditional metrics, IRR (Internal Rate of Return), MOIC (Multiple Of Invested Capital) are through the roof for all funds because every investment is marked up. Then how do you know what’s actually working or not working?See, when we look at our own performance, we focus equally on input and output. The time horizon from investment to exit can be 8-12 years, quite long. Our primary metric is founder NPS (net promoter score). Do founders, a few months after working with us, feel like Elevation is the best partner they could have had? Are we contributing to their success?Secondly, the metric is liquidity. You raise certain dollars, how many dollars have you returned? IRR, MOIC are classic proxies but it is finally about real dollar returns for your investors.Got it. We also wanted to get your sense on last year’s most awaited IPO- Paytm. It was a landmark moment for Elevation and the ecosystem. But given it tanked so badly, is there something different the company or bankers, etc, could have done? Anything you would have done differently?I wasn’t closely involved in the IPO process, but I have known Vijay (Shekhar Sharma) for 8-9 years because a few years into Elevation, I started spending some time with Paytm. I can tell you that after meeting so many founders over the last 10-11 years, Vijay is by far the most visionary founder we have in India. And I know I'm making a very bold statement, but I have no ambiguity about that. And if you reflect on that journey, it started out as a mobile VAS (value-added services) company. In 2008 this guy knew Marc Andreessen and what was happening in the US. I saw an interview of his (CNBC Young Turks) from 2008, and I was blown away. It was like a tech founder talking today. What he has achieved, from VAS to mobile internet recharge to a wallet to a super app to a full fledged financial services player- if anyone would have predicted those milestones, no one would have believed him. So his understanding of where the world is moving, big shifts happening, what consumers are going to want and as a founder and company what they need to do-I don't think anyone comes close in foresight and vision. And I don't think there is any company in India which has gone through this kind of a transformational journey. So in the long run, I have zero doubt that Paytm is going to be a very very valuable company.Mukul, Meesho, your investment, was one of the industry’s biggest breakouts of 2021. What has worked for them? For most founders, their biggest strength is either being a visionary or execution. I think Vidit (Aatrey) is the only founder who is very, very strong in both of those dimensions. Like Vijay, he identified that this shift is happening. Till the beginning of last year, we were completely focused on micro entrepreneurs. We made Meesho a compelling platform for them by creating the leanest, lowest-cost supply chain in the country. We had no logistics, we had no warehousing, we had no inventory, but we had the best supply and therefore resellers would get those products on Meesho 15-25% cheaper than any other platform in the country. And as a result, with zero marketing, we were seeing consumers coming onto the platform on their own. So Meesho was not marketing to end consumers. And even as an end-consumer at that time the checkout flow was for a reseller, where once you add a product to the cart, it will ask what markup to add, etc, aimed at micro entrepreneurs.  Do you want to do, etc, which was the micro entrepreneur behaviour. Then Vidit felt that we have a very unique opportunity to build the Taobao (owned by Alibaba in China) or PinDuoDuo (Chinese online seller with a market cap of $75 billion) or Shopee of India, given we already had the capability.  Amazon and Flipkart were built for users like you and me- they solve for convenience over pricing. By contrast, majority of the Indian market values price over convenience. They are willing to wait an extra day if they get the product cheaper. And Meesho had always been solving for that even for resellers. So we realised that this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to democratise commerce. And that's where around February-March last year, we really started experimenting with consumers, started changing the product to target end-consumers. And at the end of 2021 that shift has played out beautifully. So now, it is a really loved end-consumer platform, it has boarded so many new consumers to e-commerce in the last 12 months. I think around 70% of our orders and users are in Tier III cities and beyond. And to align the whole company culture, product and execute in that direction is why I said Vidit is phenomenal with execution.If someone had said five years back, I want to build a TaoBao of India, no one would have funded them because you need so much capital, how will you ever compete with Flipkart, Amazon, etc. But I think things played out beautifully where the business was built for micro entrepreneurs. And that journey got us to a point early last year, where it was a very, very robust business supply chain business model. And that helped us lean into this B2C (business to consumer).This is a two-part question. As far as food delivery is concerned, it has mostly been a duopoly, with Swiggy and Zomato dominating the market. But if you look at the scenario now for Swiggy's Instamart, you have large conglomerates, standalone apps and then Instamart. Secondly if you have to give us two breakout themes that will work for you- like Meesho, Swiggy- what would they be?  Today it looks like they were always in a duopoly. But if you look at the 2017-18-19 phase before UberEATS merged with Zomato, UberEATS was very very aggressive at one point, losing money on every order at an unheard-of level. Similarly, Ola had bought Foodpanda, and you would remember all the cities were plastered with that buy-one get-one offer. So, in the early days, it was an equally noisy market where everyone realised it's an attractive opportunity and multiple players were taking their shots at it. But eventually now it's a duopoly and because of Swiggy's execution muscle and customer obsession. At that time, they didn't have a headstart. They had actually come from behind, having started after TinyOwl and Foodpanda.Today, Instamart or quick commerce is at a similar point. Everyone realises it's a very attractive opportunity and 3-5 years out, it is going to be a big market and everyone wants to get after that. But unlike earlier when Swiggy came from behind, today they have a lot of capabilities which are actually built out. They already have a very large customer base. They already have a very strong ops muscle and delivery fleet which is your essential ingredient in this category. And obviously they have significant capital. So this market is no different from where food delivery was. But Swiggy today is actually much much better enabled so if they could come from behind with none of the enablers and win in a super competitive market here, the odds are much more in our favour to really dominate the quick commerce market.On the second one, there are two very big themes that we are doubling down on- SaaS and Web 3.0. From our current fund almost a third of the money is in SaaS investments. That was never the case.Is it also because you kind of missed the first boom of SaaS? Freshworks, Druva, even a Postman or Chargebee later on.I would say so. Yes, we were late to the opportunity. But in the last 2-2.5 years, we have over-indexed on that. We are not just investing, we are also building differentiated capabilities in that area. So, for example, we have set up a team in Salt Lake City, Utah (also where Arora’s co-managing partner Adusumalli is based). Salt Lake City is a big SaaS hub in the US, and they have probably the best sales and Go to Market (GTM) talent in the US. So we have set up a team there. And the idea is that when we invest in SaaS companies based out of India, for all of them the US is their largest market. So can we help them build their GTM team, sales team and help hire their leadership in the US? And that can really increase their chances of success. And Web 3.0?(Said to be the new era of the internet where businesses will be built on blockchain rails and where the metaverse could be mainstream)This is an area where in some ways a platform shift is happening. And historically, whenever platform shifts have happened, they create a disproportionate share of overall value creation, whether it was from desktop to mobile, mobile internet, etc, or Web 1.0 to Web 2.0. So we don't think this will be any different. And that's where, again, we are investing aggressively in that area. So this year itself I think close to 15% of our capital has gone into Web 3.0. And going forward, that will only increase. And of course, consumer tech, consumer brands, and fintech are our bread and butter and the focus there will continue.Did it take time for you to build conviction on Web 3.0? Some investors still wonder whether it is a fad. We were not actually worried about that. If I look at some of the early Web 3.0 businesses, they were more at the application layer for Indian users. And there is a regulatory grey area, which was making us take a pause. But now we are seeing Web 3.0  businesses being built globally, from India, for the global market. Polygon is a great example. It's a platform being built for the global market. We are seeing a lot of startups coming up at the infrastructure layer. That gets us excited.When you speak to founders in your portfolio or otherwise, what's the biggest challenge that they have in the current environment? So, in the current environment, the number one challenge is hiring. Even earlier, our advice to every seed and Series A founder after raising capital was that you should be spending at least 25-30% of your time on hiring. Today far fewer candidates join you after meeting you. The RoI (Return on Investment) on that time spent is very low. And then the founder feels, I could have made more progress with people I have versus trying to hire. So it's not easy in their shoes. But even now, the idea is to spend disproportionate time on building out that team in the early days, but it is very, very hard.What do you think sets Elevation apart from other VC funds?In our mind, it is our ethos of that zero to one, like partnering with founders very early and working with them in the trenches till they find PMF (product market fit). And that's the hardest part of a startup journey. Once you find PMF, capital today is a commodity. There are enough and more investors who will give you capital. But there are very, very few investors who will work with you before PMF in that zero-to-one journey where you will have multiple stumbles, multiple failures before you hit that mark. And that's what we believe really differentiates us. That's what our portfolio founders tell us really differentiates us. So that's the ethos we want to maintain going forward as well.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/startup/indias-startup-and-tech-market-has-finally-hit-product-market-fit-elevation-capitals-mukul-arora-7949801.html,Funding,"But Swiggy today is actually much much better enabled so if they could come from behind with none of the enablers and win in a super competitive market here, the odds are much more in our favour to really dominate the quick commerce market.On the second one, there are two very big themes that we are doubling down on- SaaS and Web 3.0.But even now, the idea is to spend disproportionate time on building out that team in the early days, but it is very, very hard.What do you think sets Elevation apart from other VC funds?In our mind, it is our ethos of that zero to one, like partnering with founders very early and working with them in the trenches till they find PMF (product market fit).","['Swiggy', 'PMF']","['a billion dollars', 'over $35 billion', 'over $3 billion', '$10 billion', '2500', 'so many $5-10 billion', '$75 billion']"

"Ola’s first employee Pranay Jivrajka starts up Allo Health, raises seed round",13 January,"Pranay Jivrajka, the first employee of cab aggregator Ola, has started up his own venture Allo Health, which focusses on sexual wellbeing for men. The venture has already raised $4.4 million in seed funding led by Nexus Venture Partners and counts some of India's leading founders and startup operators as early investors.Apart from Nexus, Flipkart co-founder Binny Bansal, Pranav Pai (3one4), Kalyan Krishnamurthy (Flipkart), Sujeet Kumar (Udaan), Ankit Bhati (Amnic/Ex Ola), Deepinder Goyal (Zomato), Rohit MA (Cloudnine), Gaurav Munjal (Unacademy), Nitin Gupta (Uni Cards), Kunal Shah (CRED), Sandeep Singhal (Nexus), Tarana Lalwani (InnoVen) and others also participated in the round.The Bengaluru-based startup will be assessing one’s sexual well being and look at end-to end treatment. Starting from assessment, consultation with doctors, home delivery of medications, scheduling therapy sessions, follow ups, home tests, the platform will be catering to all of these services.Some of the handful of players in the niche market include MyMuse and Formen, which sell sexual wellness products. Another player - Mosaic Wellness - which runs Manmatters and Bodywise, also operates in the same segment and raised $24 million last year led by Sequoia Capital India.Prior to starting up, Jivrajka worked with Ola for almost a decade and headed Ola Foods from 2017 till early 2021.Last week, Moneycontrol reported that Ola's co-founder Ankit Bhati will be launching a new startup called Amnic in the software as a service (SaaS) space along with former colleagues Satya Nagarajan and Nimish Joshi.

"Exclusive: SaaS startups struggle with high attrition due to WFH, funding boom",13 January,"Two leading Indian software-as-a-service (SaaS) entrepreneurs were left scratching their heads recently. An engineer joined a SaaS startup, left it after one week to join another. He left the second one after a week as well to join a third startup.In three weeks, he increased his salary 150 percent by jumping jobs thrice. And this happened in the relatively quiet and sedate SaaS startup space, far from the hullabaloo of consumer internet companies with their slick apps, sky-high valuations and doting customers.The entrepreneurs, who would be seething under normal circumstances, chalked it up to an ecosystem that’s enjoying the highest of highs. Both founders let the engineer go without even exercising his notice period because they felt that someone who wanted to jump on a whim wouldn’t fit into their culture anyway. They only vowed to make their hiring and filtering process better to weed out such oddities.Indian SaaS startups have been growing at a dizzying pace. They have raised money at valuations 2-3 years ahead of plans and have mostly never looked better. But employees – across sales, marketing, product and engineering – are leaving in droves, struggling to feel comfortable or fit into global companies while working from home and lured by quick pay increases from other startups, a chance that may not have been available a few years ago.Employee attrition for SaaS startups rose 25-40 percent in 2021 from levels in 2020, with some companies having had to replace as much as a quarter of their workforce in a single year, according to founders and investors who spoke to Moneycontrol. For new employees who joined in the past 18-20 months, the attrition is as high as 50 percent in some startups. While startups are engaged in an all-out war for talent across sectors, SaaS companies face some particularly thorny issues.SaaS-specific issuesEmployees in SaaS companies are distributed globally because most of their customers are from the US, Europe and, in some cases, Latin America and Southeast Asia. These global teams have been working from home for almost two years – every time a company plans to reopen offices, it is spoiled by another wave of Covid-19. India-based consumer internet startups, on the other hand, have had employees coming to the office for months between the first and second waves and between the second wave and the current outbreak of the Omicron variant.“SaaS is the hottest sector today. While we enjoy global talent from the US and Europe, the paucity of talent and competition is real. Because of working from home, many employees do face productivity issues,” said Khadim Batti, co-founder of SoftBank-backed Whatfix, which helps digital adoption in enterprises.Employees have often felt isolated or disconnected from an organisation, especially when they have joined during the pandemic. One employee said that if he were working in the office, he could have vented his frustrations at a colleague or taken a break with workmates for a snack. But when he is frustrated and at home, he is tempted to take a recruiter’s call and be whisked away – his way of dealing with a bad day. Even some senior hires face productivity issues while working from home, affecting the company’s overall strategy as well as team morale.“New employees often don’t connect with the organisation, having worked remotely for the entire time. So they leave,” said Rohit Chennamaneni, co-founder of Darwinbox, which helps companies manage HR processes digitally. “On the other hand, when we held regional parties and offsites, some people even withdrew their resignations.”“When the pandemic started, I thought if companies don’t resort to work from home, employees would leave. Now, it is the opposite – employees are leaving because of WFH,” an SaaS company founder said, requesting anonymity.High attrition is of particular concern to SaaS startups, which typically employ far fewer people than consumer internet firms. A $10 billion SaaS company may have less than half the employees that a $10 billion consumer internet firm may have, making each worker that much more important.Employee costsSoftware startups, which enjoy gross margins of 70-80 percent, are seeing these margins hit by the high cost of replacing employees more frequently. Even though companies can afford to pay an exceptional employee an outsized salary, this would break their overall structures.“We are also very diligent in maintaining compensation bands. That’s part of why we lost a few people, because if you make an exception and pay a crazy salary to one person, it sets a precedent and pre-empts poor culture,” Chennamaneni said.Indian SaaS startups raised $4.5 billion from investors in 2021, almost three times the amount raised in 2020, giving companies more ammunition to poach candidates who were previously out of reach.India’s SaaS community is a closely knit one, with a number of gatherings and forums to discuss trends and challenges and a dedicated venture capital fund recently cofounded by Freshworks founder Girish Mathrubootham. Founders have started agreeing on verbal no-poaching agreements, especially for senior candidates. But such agreements only go so far.A fintech unicorn recently poached an engineer from a SaaS startup by offering him Rs 80 lakh per annum, quadrupling his previous salary, said a person aware of the matter.The scramble for talent though is expected to continue. “The talent demand-supply gap is a key constraint for future growth, with SaaS-specific talent demand expected to grow two to three times in the next 5 years,” a 2021 Bain report on India’s SaaS industry said.Founders and senior leaders try various ways to motivate employees and keep them connected to the organisation, including having to turn on the video during team calls, holding planned yet supposedly informal catchup sessions, and offsites in resorts laced with games and alcohol – the only activity that seems to have worked.Finally, as the talent war intensifies in India, companies may start relying on hiring workers from far-flung countries.“We are looking at some non-traditional countries like Ukraine and the Philippines for talent, especially in technology and customer support. We think this widens the pool and helps our cost structure too,” Whatfix’s Batti said.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/startup/exclusive-saas-startups-struggle-with-high-attrition-due-to-wfh-funding-boom-7929541.html,Funding,"That’s part of why we lost a few people, because if you make an exception and pay a crazy salary to one person, it sets a precedent and pre-empts poor culture,” Chennamaneni said.Indian SaaS startups raised $4.5 billion from investors in 2021, almost three times the amount raised in 2020, giving companies more ammunition to poach candidates who were previously out of reach.India’s SaaS community is a closely knit one, with a number of gatherings and forums to discuss trends and challenges and a dedicated venture capital fund recently cofounded by Freshworks founder Girish Mathrubootham.“The talent demand-supply gap is a key constraint for future growth, with SaaS-specific talent demand expected to grow two to three times in the next 5 years,” a 2021 Bain report on India’s SaaS industry said.Founders and senior leaders try various ways to motivate employees and keep them connected to the organisation, including having to turn on the video during team calls, holding planned yet supposedly informal catchup sessions, and offsites in resorts laced with games and alcohol – the only activity that seems to have worked.Finally, as the talent war intensifies in India, companies may start relying on hiring workers from far-flung countries.“We are looking at some non-traditional countries like Ukraine and the Philippines for talent, especially in technology and customer support.",[],"['$10 billion', '$10 billion', '$4.5 billion']"

"Flying taxi startup The ePlane Company raises $5 million from Naval Ravikant, Speciale Invest, others",10 January,"India’s first flying taxi startup ‘The ePlane Company’, which plans to launch electric planes for intra-city travel, announced on January 10 that it has raised $5 million in pre-series A funding led by hard-tech venture capitalist Speciale Invest and clean mobility fund Micelio.Vishesh Rajaram, Managing Partner, Speciale Invest, said: “The eplane Company is one of the unique companies with the vision to create technology that will make India self-sufficient. We at Speciale Invest are fortunate to be associated with them. It aligns with our vision of backing disruptive companies solving global problems via tech innovations very well. With this round, they are well on their way to making regional aerial transportation a reality. All the very best to them.”The consortium of investors who participated in this round of funding for the Chennai-based startup included Naval Ravikant, 3one4 Capital, UTEC (University of Tokyo Edge Capital), Anicut Capital, Infoedge, Prashant Pitti (co-founder of Easemytrip), Thought Ventures, Java Capital, and Firstcheque.vc.The e-plane start-up, which was co-founded by Aerospace Engineering professor Satya Chakravarthy and his student, IIT Madras graduate Pranjal Mehta, in 2017, had raised $1 million in March last year.The company has already flown a lab-scale prototype of the electric flying taxi, e200, which they claim can cut down travel time for door-to-door commute in cities greatly at just 1.5 times the fare of regular taxis.According to The eplane Company, the “world’s most compact flying taxi” could help reduce congestion on roads and emissions from ground transport while lowering the risk of road accidents by enabling short-range commute of passengers and cargo by air.The new funds raised by the deep-tech startup will be used to make investments in product development, increase its engineering bandwidth, local certification capability, and the number of prototypes.The company said in a statement: “The fresh lease of funds would help bolster the hiring of top-tier talent, advance R&D, and continue to gain airworthiness provision and initiate certification.”“Our product will not have any dedicated infrastructure requirements and can make the city commute ten times faster at just 1.5 times the taxi fare,"" said, Pranjal Mehta, Co-founder, The ePlane Company, said.Mehta added: “Our mission has always been to explore efficient, safer, and carbon-neutral mobility solutions.

Avataar secures $45 million Series B funding led by Tiger Global,07 January,"AI and Computer Vision platform Avataar has raised $45 million Series B funding led by Tiger Global with participation from Sequoia India.Founded by Prashanth Aluru, Sravanth Aluru, Gaurav Baid, and Mayank Tiwari, Avataar has developed a platform that helps large e-commerce marketplaces and direct-to-consumer (D2C) brands to create immersive and interactive shopping experiences for their consumers.The firms can integrate Avataar's plug-and-play technology into their websites and mobile apps, to help consumers evaluate the look and feel of products in true life-size in their homes using the camera on their mobile phones.For instance, a consumer looking to purchase a refrigerator can drop a virtual version in their own kitchen and walk around to evaluate the look and feel. They are also able to toggle between available colors, open and close the doors, and compare multiple refrigerator types side-by-side, the company said. It claims to work with e-commerce, consumer electronics, auto OEMs, and major FMCG players across the United States, India, and Southeast Asia.“More than 60 percent of human sensory neural processing is visual in nature, and the lack of spatial depth on flat screens today drives a big experience gap between the digital (static 2D images and videos) and the physical world experiences.

Want to build an independent business and list in 3 years: Dunzo CEO Kabeer Biswas,07 January,"For its entire existence, Dunzo has been like a young batsman whose T20 debut series goes spectacularly well but pundits doubt whether this boy can survive the rigor of test and one-day cricket. Dunzo that started in 2016 rose to cult status in Bengaluru by delivering and facilitating cigarettes and junk food through the night to the city's energetic yuppies and techies. True to the startup playbook, it raised funding rounds nearly every year from well-regarded investors but its real potential remained unclear. After all, you can't make a billion-dollar company that depends on just one city, right? What about other cities?Dunzo may have silenced some critics with its latest funding round where the retail arm of India's largest conglomerate Reliance acquired a 25.8 percent stake by leading a $240 million investment that valued the firm at about $800 million.The critics may still have a point though. While Dunzo chief executive and cofounder Kabeer Biswas stresses that 10-minute delivery -- the industry fad -- is not the firm’s priority, rivals Swiggy's Instamart, Bigbasket, and upstart Zepto are breathing down its neck. In an interview with Moneycontrol, Biswas spoke about why he went with Reliance, why India will opt for slower but free deliveries, and his ambitions to build an independent company that will hit the public markets in three years. Edited excerpts: Why Reliance, why not Swiggy or Tata, considering you were already running a pilot with Tata-owned Bigbasket? I think you're optimising for a few things. First, we wanted to be able to build an independent business. Second, the idea was to be able to say there are multiple parts of this business where we will learn more things while we go ahead and build this and none of the answers is 100 percent known right now. And thirdly, we'd like to be able to find a path to being able to be a public company over the next three years, hopefully. I think I've had some of the most insightful retail conversations (with Reliance). And I think the fact that they are the biggest retailer in the country comes across in some of those conversations. And I think we were able to go ahead and be able to find a match on learnings and what we were optimising for.  I'm not going to comment on any of the other ones. Are you happy with the valuation of around $800 million? It was widely expected that this will be a unicorn ($1 billion valuation or above) round for Dunzo? I don't care. We don't even talk about it. It's just not something that's in our DNA. And we don't really think about that every day in the morning, we care about our customers, and we want to be able to make the best possible user experience for them. And we'll always focus on that. That's the number one thing that we like to talk about.We're at a very curious phase in quick commerce globally, where quick commerce is both one of the hottest themes in the world and one of the most controversial with companies losing a lot of money. How do you make sure that you don't lose money on every order? And what will it take to become positive at a unit economics level? So in Bengaluru, I think we have launched the model and we have been able to perfect it to a point where you can go out and start thinking of being able to make money on it. So we have done a few things, one, I don't think our marketing, etc, is based on quick (commerce). Because the first thing that we have learned over the last 18-24 months while going ahead and delivering to customers from local stores has been that in the long run customers care a lot more about what you said about selection, about quality and about the price of products that you are going ahead and selling. So what are the items that you have in the store?And it's got to do with the hierarchy of how people think, do you have the item? What's the price point? Will you give me good quality? And will you bring it? I think that's the hierarchy. People think about the problem, right. And bringing quickly is important, but just optimising on that is not going to be enough. So we fundamentally optimise on the first three over that, because that's what leads to long-term customer retention. The second one we are learning is that global markets might have gone ahead and done a model from which we can all go ahead and be inspired from. But it's important to go ahead and be realistic to India's economics and density and all of that. So we are not marketing 10-minute delivery, we are actually marketing the fact that you should go out and try and buy fresh flowers and stuff like that. You can get the order delivered within about 20 minutes with a delivery charge. And if you want it for free, it will take about 45 minutes to get delivered. An instant order is going to cost you money. And then slightly delaying the order is going to come to you for free. And we see the adoption for free being really high. At least what we have right now is a fundamental way of going about it and making money. How many Indians are willing to pay for delivery? Right now it is 50:50. We do believe that customers prefer free delivery in the country. And it's very, very important to scale across 20 cities. And I think you will start seeing the delayed free delivery option also settled between 20 and 30 minutes, you will be able to find enough density to be able to batch orders and be able to deliver it for free within 30 to 40 minutes. And we do believe that the models will innovate and iterate for everybody to hopefully get them. That's the model that we are following. And for that, we have seen massive adoption. Is there an average ticket size for which consumers will be willing to pay? Are they willing to pay for higher ticket sizes? I think ticket sizes are a terrible way to think about it, what you think about is occasions. I think the endpoint is it will be free delivery, it will be slower. It's okay to create adoption in some fashion. But we fundamentally believe that it will be free delivery, but it will be slower. That's the only way that you can go ahead and make this work. The other part of this is the average order values do come in at about Rs 350-400. So you can actually go out and get enough margins in the business to be able to make your economics work. But I think what's happening is a lot of category creation and adoption, which is being understood as the endpoint of what the category might look like. I think there's a lot of information that's now coming out of European and American markets. What everybody is realising is you need to slow down to make money. Check out: Moneycontrol Masterclass Ep 15 | Delivery wars: 15-minute groceries, anyone?The last time we spoke, you mentioned you are doing 40,000 orders a day in Bengaluru. So can you give us a sense of what your weekly order numbers are now? And also your GMV (gross merchandise value)? The GMV numbers we won't be able to quote. So we just launched in one city rather than going ahead and launching in 7-8-10 cities at the same time. We are expecting to do a million and a half orders on a monthly basis. So weekly 300,000-400,000. Maybe this month or next month. I think as a one-city business, we might be the biggest right now because we just got one city's model right. We were very concerned about the fact that it's important to get the model perfectly right in one city before launching in multiple cities. So if you were to think about white spaces in the country, right, in terms of what are the biggest commerce white spaces that can get digitised? What you're most likely looking at is the largest space in the country, right now. This is your daily and weekly transactions happening in the top 30 cities in the country. Think of them as the biggest 2,000 demand centres where people do buy local, right, and those local transactions are going to get digitised at some point in time. And I'm not saying everything will come through this medium and stuff like that. Some of it will be enabling local stores. Some of it will be coming from these online-only locations.And so what you will see will most likely become one of the largest online categories that bring GMV online over the next two or three years. You want to look at the data that will most likely be smaller than ecommerce but bigger than everything else. Because of the organic nature of the use cases, people buy two or three times a week. And the average order value is in the range of Rs 300-400 per order. Does this round make a difference for you as a founder psychologically? Psychologically, you've been in a place where you constantly have to look at your next round. Now, one, you've raised your largest round ever and, two, you got an investor who can bankroll many future rounds. I think the doggedness of the business doesn't change. This is a tough business, right? It's a business where you need to be very, very interested by the nuances and by the inches, to be able to go ahead and actually make money. I think what does change is most likely the investments that we can make in the really long term of what this business can look like. We don't think of capital being available in any fashion if you're not going out and hitting it out of the park. And so for us, being able to go ahead and hit it out of the park, be category leaders, be number one, is very important. And we will go out and keep indexing on that as we have before.Will Dunzo continue to be an independent entity after this investment? And can you also tell us more about your plans to go public in the next three years? I think it was one of the key thoughts behind being able to find a lot of philosophical sync, in being able to do this. One was, just the understanding of retail. And the pace of decision making, etc, that I've seen from Reliance has been very, very exciting to learn from. We were optimising for the fact that we wanted to build an independent business, an independent brand, be able to keep iterating because a lot of this is us going ahead and tinkering with what can happen next for us to be able to find new markets and new customer experiences. And the fact that we wanted to be an independent business and be able to list in the next two or three years was something that I think everybody on our captable has been able to sign up for. How will this work on the backend? Because the announcement said Dunzo will start servicing last-mile delivery for JioMart.  So can you take us through how this is going to work? Some of this is still work in progress and we haven't firmed up everything. There are two lines to businesses for us, one is the Dunzo daily, which is about delivering quick and daily and weekly essentials to our customers within 15 minutes. And the second one is that because of that, we go out and have a really large delivery network. And that delivery network then goes ahead and becomes available for absolutely everybody else out there in the country to be able to ship packages on. So it is our B2B (business to business) business. On both of them, there are clear areas of partnerships that we are considering. On the daily and weekly essentials side of it, it just supercharges our entire supply chain network. And the second one is that the B2B business can go ahead and enable a lot of deliveries that are happening off the Reliance Retail network, the JioMart network. Some of these are still things that are being discussed or a work in progress. It really allows for the cost of the network to get optimised a lot. ",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/startup/want-to-build-an-independent-business-and-list-in-3-years-dunzo-ceo-kabeer-biswas-7909031.html,Funding,"Because the first thing that we have learned over the last 18-24 months while going ahead and delivering to customers from local stores has been that in the long run customers care a lot more about what you said about selection, about quality and about the price of products that you are going ahead and selling.And I think you will start seeing the delayed free delivery option also settled between 20 and 30 minutes, you will be able to find enough density to be able to batch orders and be able to deliver it for free within 30 to 40 minutes.",[],"['billion-dollar', '$240 million', 'about $800 million', 'around $800 million', '$1 billion']"

Challenges confronting the boom in India’s initial public offerings,30 December,"It’s not easy to get bank loans on reasonable terms or raise funds from venture capitalists and angel investors so many small and medium enterprises (SMEs) are seeking to raise money through initial public offerings (IPOs) to expand.  Buoyancy in the primary market in the past months, with many issues getting subscribed multiple times the size of the offerings and bumper listings, has enthused small businesses to consider going public.  Most of them are unaware of what it will take to list on the stock exchanges. Many cannot afford the expenses of listing even on dedicated and low-cost platforms for SMEs on the Bombay Stock Exchange and the National Stock Exchange.   Yet, many enterprising entrepreneurs are finding ways to overcome barriers to taking their businesses public. The fundraising plans of these entities are modest, they are looking to raise less than Rs 10 crore. Self Storage India CEO Manjali Khosla is among the many entrepreneurs diligently understanding the process involved in listing on small companies’ exchanges. Her company specialises in renting out small, private dedicated storage rooms. ""I have been doing quite a bit of homework and been meeting two merchant bankers. While information about SME IPO was not complex, the internal preparation work is quite a lot especially when one wants to have good reception in the market."" Khosla hopes to take her venture to the market in July. She sees enough demand in the market to grow her business two-three times. But finding enough capital has been a problem. So far, she has reached out to her family when she needed to invest more money in her business. Credibility  Khosla has understood some of the benefits of listing her venture. One of the upsides she expects from the listing is a rise in the credibility of her business, which she expects will give her an edge over competitors. Co-founder of Jaipur-based Healing Crystals Abhishek Sharma has hired merchant bankers and is in the process of preparing the prospectus for the listing. ""We aim to go public in the first quarter of the next year. We have not finalised the size of the issue but I am hopeful of raising around Rs. 5-8 crore,"" said Sharma. He had approached banks and angel investors for funding, but now thinks a public listing the right solution for his company. ""A listing would not help us with the capital for growth but will also help our brand image and visibility,” said Sharma Ahmedabad-based cashew processor Fortune Exports hopes to make its market debut in March-April 2022. Its founder Vimal Mishra tried borrowing from banks, which demanded large collateral that he could not provide. He explored other options for raising capita and found no satisfactory offers.   “I work in a highly capital-intensive industry and everything depends on the raw material. To survive in this industry, I need capital to maintain 6-8 months’ worth of raw material stocks. That would give me an edge,” said Mishra.  IPO frenzy in the making? Capital markets have been an insignificant source of funding for the MSME sector. Less than 1% of the equity capital funds of such business were raised from the market. The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and capital crunch faced by these companies are bringing about a change. “Following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the necessity and importance of equity funding has been understood by the MSME founders,” said Ajay Thakur, head of BSE SME, the platform for listing and trading in stocks of small and medium-sized businesses run by BSE Ltd. “We expect the number of listings on the platform to be much higher this fiscal. About 50 MSMEs have filed for approval and 25 have already been listed. On average, 30-40 companies list annually,” Thakur added.  SME IPOs had taken a hit last year with only 20 prospectuses filed in 2020-21. Amit Kumar, founder and CEO of MSMEx, an MSME education and growth consulting services platform said that there is renewed enthusiasm among MSME entrepreneurs to understand the possibilities of listing.  Yet, most MSMEs do not have the money to finance their IPOs, he added. An IPO can cost up to Rs. 45-50 lakh. This problem is being overcome by roping in institutional investors who are given a share in equity in exchange for funds to cover the cost. Khosla, Sharma and Mishra are members of the SME cohort with MSMEx.  Challenges, constraints    Making available a dedicated platform for small and medium businesses and keeping compliance requirements light may not be enough to encourage SMEs to tap the capital market. The SME IPO system needs to rethink and stakeholders should make the ecosystem more conducive for SME listings, Indorient Financial Services executive director & compliance officer Ivor Misquith said.  Indorient had a lead managed for an SME IPO in 2020. ""There should be a separate window for SMEs to bring out their IPOs.""   If there is a mainboard IPO happening concurrently with an SME IPO, a lot of retail investors will put money in the mainboard IPO, Misquith said.  That affects the subscription levels of the IPO of a small company. Therefore a separate window to avoid this conflict between the mainboard and the SME IPOs is needed, he explained.  The minimum lot size of Rs 1 lakh is another impediment to the success of an SME IPO, Misquith said. This is way higher than the minimum lot size of Rs 10,000-15,0000 for a mainboard IPO.  “Why would an investor block Rs. 1 lakh instead of putting Rs.15k in a mainboard IPO?” he asked.  Investors would prefer to invest Rs 15,000 each in different IPOs on the mainboard rather than invest Rs. 1 lakh on an SME IPO. Regulators need to do a rethink on the minimum lot size of SME IPOs to encourage bigger participation of retail investors, Misquith said.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/challenges-confronting-the-boom-in-indias-initial-public-offerings-7879641.html,Funding,"Buoyancy in the primary market in the past months, with many issues getting subscribed multiple times the size of the offerings and bumper listings, has enthused small businesses to consider going public.“Following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the necessity and importance of equity funding has been understood by the MSME founders,” said Ajay Thakur, head of BSE SME, the platform for listing and trading in stocks of small and medium-sized businesses run by BSE Ltd. “We expect the number of listings on the platform to be much higher this fiscal.","['COVID-19', 'BSE', 'BSE Ltd.']",[]

Exponent Energy raises $5 million to build 15-min rapid charging solutions for commercial EVs,08 December,"Exponent Energy, a startup working on bringing rapid charging solutions to electric vehicles (EVs) in India, has raised $5 million funding from existing investors YourNest VC, 3one4 Capital and AdvantEdge VC. Motherson Group, a leading global supplier of automotive components, also participated in the funding round.Founded by former Ather Energy chief product officer Arun Vinayak with his colleague Sanjay Byalal in late 2020, Exponent Energy says it has developed a technology that can charge any electric vehicle from 0-100% within 15 minutes.""If you look at EVs today, the ride experience has become better, due to which the 0-1 shift has happened across multiple categories. However, everything on the energy side in EVs is still very slow, broken and expensive, which is really holding back the adoption in the country,"" Vinayak told Moneycontrol.Also read: Hyundai lines up Rs 4,000 crore investment to drive in 6 EVs in India by 2028He said EVs currently take anywhere between four to eight hours to charge batteries that last around 1,000 cycles, which leads to poor utilization of charging stations. This makes these stations unprofitable as a business since they are able to sell energy to only two or three vehicles on a given day.""Due to this, the charging network doesn't organically grow. To combat the range anxiety and slow charging, OEMs also have to opt for a larger battery size, which makes the vehicle expensive and heavy. A short battery life also makes the financing for battery packs expensive"" Vinayak said.Bengaluru-based Exponent Energy hopes to change this situation with its products. The startup came out of stealth mode in November this year to debut a Flexible Energy Stack - a combination of hardware and software solutions - that provides a 15-minute rapid charge on a wide range of affordable Li-ion cells as well as gives a 3,000 cycle life warranty.Also read: Work underway to set up EV charging stations at 22,000 of 70,000 petrol pumps in country: GovtThe firm said this was made possible due to its proprietary battery management system and charging algorithms, that's layered on top of the design of its battery pack called E-pack, along with its common charging station called E-pump. This solution will support charging from 40 volts to 800 volts.Vinayak said this technology will enable smaller batteries to become more viable in electric vehicles, wherein people can 'recharge like they refuel' whenever they need, which also makes the charging network infrastructure more profitable since they can charge anywhere between 30-50 vehicles on a given day. This will also allow OEMs to sell vehicles with more optimized battery sizes with longer financing tenures.Commercial operations from early 2022The funds raised from this round will be used to kickstart its commercial operations in early 2022, starting with Bengaluru and then expanding it to multiple cities. ""Motherson coming on board adds a lot of strategic value for us with respect to OEM relationships and manufacturing partnerships"" he said.Also read: Ashok Leyland in talks with investors to raise funds for EV subsidiary Switch Mobility""As the auto industry adopts EVs, we want to remain a key player, and partnering with startups like Exponent gives us a head start to be able to build offerings that help us continue to expand and achieve our broader vision,"" said Laksh Vaaman Sehgal, Vice Chairman, Motherson Group.The proceeds will also be used to build more software products, employ a deployment team for smooth operations and strengthen its product and engineering teams. Exponent Energy currently has about 27 employees with plans to expand to over 50 employees in the next few months.""The Exponent team has combined their deep insights from the EV and energy distribution systems in India with core IP innovation to solve a long-standing challenge through a disruptive yet elemental set of modalities,"" said Pranav Pai, Founding Partner, 3one4 Capital. ""With the radical reforms that are being rolled out in the country, this technology will be a natural enabler of India's shift into sustainable energy and mobility infrastructure.""Focus on cargo vehiclesWhile Exponent Energy's technology works across various form factors, it is initially focusing on last-mile three-wheeler and four-wheeler cargo vehicles due to a lot of inbound demand from logistics players and aggregators.""There are three stakeholders for us - those who buy cargo vehicles and run them, those who build cargo vehicles, and the charging partners who want to charge up these cargo vehicles and make money on the energy side. We are working with all three stakeholders and our success comes in ensuring all these folks win,"" Vinayak said.The startup is working with OEMs that are building three wheeler and four wheeler cargo vehicles to integrate their batteries. ""So you will see us having vehicles from one of these OEMs with our batteries integrated very soon,"" he said.In terms of charging partners, the firm is signing up small business owners and commercial property owners among others, who are keen to buy charge stations, set them up and monetize the charging process.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/startup/exponent-energy-raises-5-million-to-build-15-min-rapid-charging-solutions-for-commercial-evs-7802691.html,Funding,"The startup came out of stealth mode in November this year to debut a Flexible Energy Stack - a combination of hardware and software solutions - that provides a 15-minute rapid charge on a wide range of affordable Li-ion cells as well as gives a 3,000 cycle life warranty.Also read: Work underway to set up EV charging stations at 22,000 of 70,000 petrol pumps in country: GovtThe firm said this was made possible due to its proprietary battery management system and charging algorithms, that's layered on top of the design of its battery pack called E-pack, along with its common charging station called E-pump.""Motherson coming on board adds a lot of strategic value for us with respect to OEM relationships and manufacturing partnerships"" he said.Also read: Ashok Leyland in talks with investors to raise funds for EV subsidiary Switch Mobility""As the auto industry adopts EVs, we want to remain a key player, and partnering with startups like Exponent gives us a head start to be able to build offerings that help us continue to expand and achieve our broader vision,"" said Laksh Vaaman Sehgal, Vice Chairman, Motherson Group.The proceeds will also be used to build more software products, employ a deployment team for smooth operations and strengthen its product and engineering teams.","['EV', 'GovtThe', 'EV', 'Motherson Group']",['$5 million']

The momentum is expected to continue with these brands expanding their reach in smaller towns and cities.“We continue to see a fair amount of traction for funding in the D2C space.  The pandemic years have also introduced new spaces and we are excited to see experienced entrepreneurs starting up innovative D2C companies,” said Dipanjan Basu, Partner and CFO at Fireside Ventures, which has invested in D2C brands like Mamaearth, boAt and Bombay Shaving.“At the same time, the bar for the companies to be differentiated has gone up and funding will be polarised towards deep innovation in products and consumer propositions,” Basu said.D2C brands could be looking at a $100-billion addressable consumer opportunity in India by 2025, Avendus Capital, the investment banking arm of financial services firm Avendus Group, said in a report last year.“Creating and more importantly, delivering on differentiated propositions and building reliable, consistent product and brand experience are what D2C brands should be solving for. There are few barriers to entry today, and many are scaling profitably,” said Shankar Prasad, Founder and CEO of Vegan beauty Plum. The space has seen a spurt of over 600 brands over the last few years. But, Basu says that some levels of consolidation have already begun in the space. “Some of the Fireside younger brands are getting folded under a House of Brand approach of larger D2C brands,” he said.Indian startups have altogether raised over $30 billion this year. Privately held startups have raised $31.2 billion, nearly three times 2020’s $11.2 billion, and more than double the previous record of $13.1 billion in 2019.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/startup/d2c-brands-treble-funding-this-year-to-2-billion-through-105-deals-7801681.html,Funding,"Direct-to-consumer (D2C) brands have nearly tripled the capital raised from investors this year, which is over $2 billion across 105 deals.The segment had witnessed a dip last year when it raised $735 million, while in 2019 (pre-COVID), the mop-up neared $1.5 billion through 120 deals, according to data from Venture Intelligence.The data shows that while the capital raised has significantly increased, the number of deals have not increased but the size has significantly grown.The pandemic years have also introduced new spaces and we are excited to see experienced entrepreneurs starting up innovative D2C companies,” said Dipanjan Basu, Partner and CFO at Fireside Ventures, which has invested in D2C brands like Mamaearth, boAt and Bombay Shaving.“At the same time, the bar for the companies to be differentiated has gone up and funding will be polarised towards deep innovation in products and consumer propositions,” Basu said.D2C brands could be looking at a $100-billion addressable consumer opportunity in India by 2025, Avendus Capital, the investment banking arm of financial services firm Avendus Group, said in a report last year.“Creating and more importantly, delivering on differentiated propositions and building reliable, consistent product and brand experience are what D2C brands should be solving for.","['Venture Intelligence', 'D2C', 'CFO', 'Fireside Ventures', 'D2C', 'Mamaearth', 'Bombay Shaving', 'D2C', 'Avendus Group', 'D2C']","['over $2 billion', '$735 million', '$1.5 billion', '$100-billion', 'over $30 billion', '$31.2 billion', '$11.2 billion', '$13.1 billion']"

Indian SaaS startups raise record $4.5 billion in 2021: Bain report,07 December,"Indian software-as-a-service startups have raised a record $4.5 billion from investors in 2021, nearly three times the previous year, led by innovation, access to capital, and a larger market size, according to a report from consultancy firm Bain and Co.The year also created six SaaS unicorns being valued at over a billion dollars or more. This was as many as the last two years put together, indicating an increased momentum in the space as they address global markets, predominantly in the US and Europe.“What is interesting is that you are seeing scale from Indian SaaS. There are many companies with $25-30 million ARR (annual recurring revenue), and quite a few with over $50 million and even $100 million,” Aditya Shukla, partner at Bain, told Moneycontrol.“These are companies that have not just found product-market fit (the first sign that a company’s product is viable) but have also scaled. They have found acceptance from a wide variety of customers and buyers,” he said.While most SaaS companies have emerged from traditional areas such as customer relationship management (CRM) and sales enablement, there are companies now in specialised software, both for niche areas, say salon and spa  management (Zenoti) or newer technology needs such as managing tech stacks and testing applications (LambdaTest, Postman).Large SaaS deals have also happened at aggressive valuation multiples, routinely at 30-40 times revenue and sometimes even more, as companies raise rounds based on distant-future predictions and optimise a frenzied deal-making environment.“A lot of these companies are category creators in areas such as DevOps (software development and IT operations), infrastructure and new verticals. SaaS companies are addressing really large markets. Even for classic CRM or ERP solutions the penetration is low, so there is headroom for growth. That leads to some of these multiples,” Shukla said.However, large listed SaaS companies in the US with $500 million to a billion dollars in annual revenue usually trade on lower valuation multiples, therefore some of this enthusiasm could temper as companies mature, he added.Newer SaaS startups are also a result of employees at older SaaS firms leaving to start up, with over 500 such employee turned founders, the report said.Shukla, however, anticipates that technology talent could become the companies’ biggest challenge. Talent shortage is such an acute problem that some SaaS startups are specifically aimed at solving hiring challenges.In the last two years, startups have also been building software for local markets - Indian customers and businesses, shifting from the US, which is where most companies earn their revenue from. Companies such as Classplus, Khatabook and Darwinbox are building software to digitise specific industries such as education, bookkeeping and human resources, respectively.“Traditionally, the companies are focused on larger markets like the US, which has sophisticated buyers who will adopt software more easily. It is more challenging to convince Indian enterprises or small and medium businesses to adopt software. It is a value-conscious market,” Shukla said.“But my sense is that it will take off, even if these companies don't get as big as global SaaS firms, which cater to large market sizes,” he said.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/startup/indian-saas-startups-raise-record-4-5-billion-in-2021-bain-report-7797251.html,Funding,"They have found acceptance from a wide variety of customers and buyers,” he said.While most SaaS companies have emerged from traditional areas such as customer relationship management (CRM) and sales enablement, there are companies now in specialised software, both for niche areas, say salon and spa  management (Zenoti) or newer technology needs such as managing tech stacks and testing applications (LambdaTest, Postman).Large SaaS deals have also happened at aggressive valuation multiples, routinely at 30-40 times revenue and sometimes even more, as companies raise rounds based on distant-future predictions and optimise a frenzied deal-making environment.“A lot of these companies are category creators in areas such as DevOps (software development and IT operations), infrastructure and new verticals.That leads to some of these multiples,” Shukla said.However, large listed SaaS companies in the US with $500 million to a billion dollars in annual revenue usually trade on lower valuation multiples, therefore some of this enthusiasm could temper as companies mature, he added.Newer SaaS startups are also a result of employees at older SaaS firms leaving to start up, with over 500 such employee turned founders, the report said.Shukla, however, anticipates that technology talent could become the companies’ biggest challenge.",['DevOps'],"['a record $4.5 billion', 'over a billion dollars', '25', 'over $50 million', '$100 million', '$500 million']"

Sense has, so far, raised $90 million from investors such as Accel, GV (formerly Google Ventures), Avataar Venture Partners, Khosla Ventures, and Signia Venture Partners.“Sense’s founding mission to equip companies to engage with best-fit talent both quickly and effectively is more important than ever.

The startup has around 185 employees across its San Francisco headquarters and its Bengaluru office.The proceeds will also be used to ramp up go-to-market strategy and increase awareness with companies that hire at scale across industries such as healthcare, manufacturing, logistics and retail.Founded in 2015 by Dharni, Ram Gudavalli, Pankaj Jindal, and Alex Rosen, Sense enables talent acquisition teams to accelerate their hiring while enabling them to personalise interactions at every stage of the employment cycle.The firm offers a clutch of candidate matching and screening services that leverages artificial intelligence and machine learning to help recruiters hire faster, it said.The startup claims to have more than 600 customers, including Amazon, Sears, Adecco, Vaco and Kelly.The company claims its customers witnessed a 263 percent increase in the number of candidates screened as compared to a manual approach and reduced the time to fill a position by 30-81 percent.“We believe the critical nature of the Sense platform in enabling enterprise customers to find and hire quality talent faster has been clear.

"Bessemer goes bullish on India, raises $220 million to deepen local ties",30 November,"Bessemer Venture Partners, an investor in start-ups such as Swiggy, Urban Company and PharmEasy, has closed its first India-dedicated fund of $220 million, doubling down on the country’s booming internet economy.While Bessemer has not been as active in India as other Silicon Valley venture firms like Sequoia, Accel and Lightspeed, its partners say, it prefers going deeper into its existing companies, instead of acquiring small stakes in multiple companies in wide-ranging sectors in the hope that a few make it big.The new fund also marks an about-face in its plans, since there were rumours of Bessemer planning to exit the India market a few years ago, led by a lack of exits. However, companies such as Zomato, Nykaa and Policybazaar have listed on exchanges to record demand, giving investors comfort and the confidence to remain focused, people close to Bessemer said. Bessemer’s own portfolio company PharmEasy filed for a listing last month, looking for a valuation of about $8 billion.“Our capital deployment pace has not changed much except for a few months here or there. We prefer having a concentrated portfolio,” said Anant Vidur Puri, partner at Bessemer. “Our general philosophy is to invest more in our existing portfolio. We actively lead follow-on rounds.” He cited PharmEasy’s example, where Bessemer led its seed, Series A and Series B rounds.From the new fund, the company plans to make 10-15 investments of $1-50 million across Seed to Series C stages of internet start-ups over the next three years or so. Its investment areas include consumer internet, marketplaces, fintech and software-as-a-service. Funding boomBessemer’s fund also coincides with an unprecedented start-up funding boom. Companies have raised over $30 billion from investors in the 11 months of 2021, more than double of previous records. Investors are often making investments driven more by FOMO (Fear of Missing Out) and less by conviction on a business model. Bessemer wants to avoid this.“Our differentiator is that we won’t chase a hot trend. We have a point of view and want to go deep into companies. You won’t find us doing deals at insane valuations,” Puri said.“This is a long and patient capital game. Valuations go up and down, that is part of the cycle,” said Vishal Gupta, partner at Bessemer. Globally, Bessemer manages over $10 billion in assets, and has invested in companies such as Shopify, LinkedIn and Discord.Not in the lending gameWhile fintech is one of the firm’s focus areas, Gupta said, it will avoid balance sheet plays or non-bank lenders, which either start-ups have become or acquired, rather than being a pure marketplace.“We are looking for fintech software plays and a differentiated business model. We don’t want to get into the balance sheet plays. It is not that NBFC is a bad business, but you have to be clear that it is capital-guzzling and will take a long time to build.

"Slice joins unicorn club with $220 million fundraise led by Tiger Global, Insight Partners",29 November,"Fintech Slice said on November 29 that it has raised $220 million in a Series B funding round which values the company at above $1 billion. The round was led by US investment giant Tiger Global and New York-based private equity and venture capital firm Insight Partners which joined as new investors.New and existing investors, including Advent International’s Sunley House Capital, Moore Strategic Ventures, Anfa, Gunosy, Blume Ventures, and 8i also participated in the round. Flipkart founder Binny Bansal and Guillaume Pousaz, founder of London-headquartered payments platform checkout.com have also invested in the round.The company currently provides a Visa card focused on millennials which allows customers to pay for their purchases in three installments. The company's card issuance spiked from 20,000 in January 2021 to 200,000 per month currently led by the growing appetite for credit in India.Slice's 'super card' serves as a simpler alternative for credit cards with lower credit limits making more people eligible to avail the benefits of paying later. The company's monthly issuance is now in-line with leading banks like HDFC Bank and ICICI Bank that issue anywhere between 2,00,000 to 3,00,000 credit cards per month.The growth over the past year coupled with the potential going forward has led to an five times jump in valuation from its previous round, underscoring the current investor appetite in India.Slice is the 41st unicorn in 2021, a year that witnessed an unprecedented funding boom led by fintech startups. A unicorn is a privately owned entity with a valuation of $1 billion or above.In an interview with Moneycontrol Slice’s founder and CEO Rajan Bajaj said that in its next phase of growth, the Bengaluru-based startup plans to invest in technology and product design and add more products starting with Unified Payments Interface (UPI).“We have now reached a phase where our revenues are growing fast. Many customers who will use UPI on our platform will start using our revenue-generating card product. Many existing card customers, too, will be able to use UPI for their payments,” Bajaj said.The company’s turnover for FY21 stood at Rs 35 crore as compared to Rs 30 crore in the previous financial year, according to regulatory filings. Loss after deducting taxes stood at Rs 8.9 crore, up from 1.87 crore in FY20.“We are number three in card issuance. Our next competition will probably from another fintech card issuer or a bank. We are currently growing by 40 percent every month. We expect this growth to continue,” he added.Slice also plans to offer credit through UPI once the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) re-introduces the product. Eventually, the platform will foray into more payment modes and financial services.Bajaj explained, “We plan to take a big slice of consumer payments in India. We will also introduce products like wallets and for tokensation. Further product launches will happen as transactions grow on our platform.”With its product plans, Slice will find itself competing with various fintech and bank players. As a pay later card issuer it already competes with banks, startups like Uni and Buy Now Pay Later (BNPL) companies which are a growing tribe.Its plans to grow in the payments space set it up against PhonePe, Google Pay, Paytm which have a huge share of UPI and wallet payments in India.For 70 percent of Slice’s customers, the card is their primary mode of making credit payments. The company earns through interchange fees, commissions from merchants and interest from late payments by customers.Alex Cook, Partner at Tiger Global, said, “We expect Slice’s product to result in continued growth and market share gains. We are excited to partner with Rajan and the team as they expand access to credit.”Deven Parekh, Managing Director at Insight Partners said that Slice targets an underpenetrated market in India referring to the low credit card penetration in India of only three percent.“There is a large opportunity in the credit and payment space in India, and slice is well-positioned to become the leader in the industry,” he added.Founded by IIT Kharagpur alumnus Bajaj in 2016, the company currently has five million registered users. In its last round of fundraising, Slice had raised $20 million from investors Gunosy and Blume Ventures.In September this year, the company lowered its credit limit to start from Rs 2,000 in a bid to make more users eligible for its product. The startup also introduced a three-day work week, with a plan to hire 1,000 full-time engineers, product managers, as well as designers under the program in the next five years.Slice, which holds a Non-Banking Financial Company (NBFC) license will come under the purview of the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) impending digital lending norms as it offers a credit product.

His company, Sequoia-backed mattress startup Wakefit just had its best month- Rs 100 crore of revenue in October alone, in addition to closing previously unplanned $30 million funding round at a 40% higher valuation than a year ago.He has got here after painstaking effort for years, shutting down two companies and nearly going broke. You would think he would be thrilled at the success.Yet Chaitanya feels nothing. Not happy, not sad, not excited. Just, nothing. “It was just a number in an excel sheet and a (number in a) press release.” What did it all really mean?Because Chaitanya is burnt out. He is hardly the only one. As India undergoes supposed technological disruption with more users shopping, paying, gaming and living online, the people behind said disruption- internet entrepreneurs and investors are feeling the heat. On the surface it looks like a fantastic time for both sets of people- startups have seen their valuations jump to record highs, new internet companies are valued many times more than their older, larger, profitable peers and venture capitalists have seen their holdings swell massively in a short period. Behind the scenes, some entrepreneurs are on the brink of burning out, spend days obsessing over their competition rather than chalking out their own plans and investors are running helter-skelter trying their hardest to squeeze into the next hot deal, sometimes without being fully convinced about the company, sometimes without even seeing the company’s numbers properly.""You feel burnt out because you are constantly running around. We live in an echo chamber populated by other founders, startup media and venture capital/private equity investors. And then you wonder whether all this work is the right use of my energy and mental bandwidth,” Chaitanya said.At play is the compressed timeline for significant business milestones. Business-to-business ecommerce firm Infra.market was valued at $200 million at the start of 2021. With two funding rounds in six months its valuation zoomed to $1 billion in March and $2.5 billion in March and August respectively. Now it is in talks to raise money valuing it at $4.5 billion, Moneycontrol reported. Similarly, social commerce firm Meesho’s valuation has gone from $2 billion at the start of the year to $5.7 billion a few months ago. All in less than a year. “Life currently feels like running at full speed in the darkness, running in something resembling Daedalus’ labyrinth,” he said, referencing the Greek architect who in the ancient myths built a confounding maze which ran underground and held a mythical monster- the Minotaur.Fast and furious: Fraud editionAt a transportation startup, an executive in charge of inventory (ensuring enough vehicles are available in a particular area) took a fixed fee from each driver/owner on the side for letting the vehicles park there. These instances are a result of the rapid expansion drives undertaken by internet startups who work with a ‘growth at all costs’ mindset- encouraged by founders and investors in India and Silicon Valley for many years.The pressure of growth—sometimes self-imposed, sometimes driven by external factors— is taking a toll on companies, where board meetings are dominated by funding discussions above all else. Any internet business with a founder seen as credible and a business seen as viable in the simplest sense, is inundated with investment offers, investors say.Founders say they are forced to be direct (read rude) when an investor sends multiple emails pitching to join a company’s not-yet-planned funding round, mail term sheets and ask for confidential information without the founder showing any sign of interest. If the deal works out, the investor’s ‘hustle’ may be appreciated but often founders either ignore these mails as long as they can, or at their wits end, send a curt “We are not raising. Not interested. Thanks” email, as per a conversation Moneycontrol has seen.“I’m not burnt out yet but if this continues it will happen for sure. I have to actively guard against it. This sort of pace is not sustainable. It is scary,” he added.Funding=junk food?In multiple sectors, from commerce to fintech to software, companies are raising successive rounds at double and triple and triple their previous valuations only because a competitor did the same, and they don’t want to be seen as lagging. “You have to set the right goal with the founder. After raising $1 million the goal can’t be to raise $10 million. Sometimes founders see competitors or others raise money and benchmark themselves to that. We have to tell them otherwise and to focus on the product, business, and customers,” says Kushal Bhagia, partner at First Cheque, a pre-seed investor. Well-funded entrepreneurs who have no plans or need to raise money still feel the pressure to raise, driven by the splashy media coverage and hundreds of congratulatory social media posts that accompany a fund raise. They sometimes benchmark their success to their public visibility.“With so much funding news, there's an automatic urge for us to raise money as well, even if we don't need it,” says Jerin Venad, co-founder and CEO of bus commute startup Cityflo“But I see it as the urge to eat unhealthy food when you're not hungry or to borrow money on my credit card just because it's available. It's tempting, but you know it's not right for you in the long run,” he addedWith money in the bank and large addressable markets, a talent crunch is becoming startups’ biggest cause for worry. Some are giving 100-150% salary hikes and still unable to retain talent while others offer prospective candidates double their expected salary and still can’t close the deal because a third party whisks away the candidate with a better offer at the last moment. Some startups are growing fast, raising large rounds and can thus justify the fat salaries and oversized hiring budgets for now. Their smaller rivals or distant competitors are being forced to give all employees an outsized pay hike, not to reward past performance, but to keep them from leaving- denting their cost structures and in the case of unprofitable companies, making them reliant on venture capital for longer than previously planned.“This can’t be life”Entrepreneurs are now making concerted efforts to disconnect from the hoopla, realising that the funding boom can lead to a personal crash. Chaitanya for example, abandons screen usage (phones, laptops, tablets,) after 10:30 pm, only reading books in that period and checking his phone only if someone calls.It is harder for internet entrepreneurs to disconnect because well, the internet is their source of sustenance. Founders increasingly rely on social media to hire candidates, get instant feedback, build their brand and even attract investors. Chaitanya for instance is active on Twitter but avoids posts from other founders and investors to avoid getting sucked into the vortex, and checks only his notifications for customer feedback or complaints which need to be addressed.Ashwin Damera has been practicing yoga and meditation for over a decade now. The co-founder and CEO of online learning firm Eruditus, valued at $3.2 billion recently, has become more spiritual as his company has grown. During the pandemic, he doubled yoga’s duration to 45 minutes each twice a day.“The startup life has so many ups and downs. This can’t be life. It can’t be so momentary. There has to be more to it,” Damera says, adding that yoga helps him be balanced and gives some a sense of detachment.What has really changed?Investors are similarly facing a challenging time, with even top multinational funds struggling to get into the hottest deals. Investors and founders suspect that the current frenzy is driven only partly by more internet users/shoppers- the factor blared in most reports and investment theses.“Consumer behavior has changed somewhat, but it has not changed in the same proportion that availability of capital and risk appetite have,” said a partner at a venture fund, requesting anonymity“US interest rates have been at record lows, the Federal Reserve has pumped in trillions and after economies have recovered from the pandemic, there’s all this risk-seeking capital which is flying into India after China cracked down on tech companies,” this investor added.Just as the funding boom has been unprecedented, if all the capital companies have raised does not result in the staggeringly-large outcomes founders and investors are betting on, the scale of fallout could be unprecedented too.The flipsideEstablished companies are going public on stock markets to record investor demand, while newer companies which may have earlier struggled to find an investor who can take a moonshot bet without expecting immediate results, are now flooded with investment offers“Burning out trying to raise money happens more often than from raising too much money. For many founders who have spent years chasing that elusive next round, this boom is a god-send,” an entrepreneur said, requesting anonymity.“Many founders are seeing this boom as a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to make money. It is a great time to be an internet entrepreneur,” she added.In most of these cases, entrepreneurs push themselves the extra yard thinking it is a short term phenomenon. But as the goalposts keep shifting, this extra push becomes a way of life, has unexpected fallouts, and that is often not a pretty sight for anyone.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/trends/features/rash-decisions-insecurity-and-burnout-the-dark-side-of-indias-startup-funding-boom-7753941.html,Funding,"“Life currently feels like running at full speed in the darkness, running in something resembling Daedalus’ labyrinth,” he said, referencing the Greek architect who in the ancient myths built a confounding maze which ran underground and held a mythical monster- the Minotaur.Fast and furious: Fraud editionAt a transportation startup, an executive in charge of inventory (ensuring enough vehicles are available in a particular area) took a fixed fee from each driver/owner on the side for letting the vehicles park there.Investors and founders suspect that the current frenzy is driven only partly by more internet users/shoppers- the factor blared in most reports and investment theses.“Consumer behavior has changed somewhat, but it has not changed in the same proportion that availability of capital and risk appetite have,” said a partner at a venture fund, requesting anonymity“US interest rates have been at record lows, the Federal Reserve has pumped in trillions and after economies have recovered from the pandemic, there’s all this risk-seeking capital which is flying into India after China cracked down on tech companies,” this investor added.Just as the funding boom has been unprecedented, if all the capital companies have raised does not result in the staggeringly-large outcomes founders and investors are betting on, the scale of fallout could be unprecedented too.The flipsideEstablished companies are going public on stock markets to record investor demand, while newer companies which may have earlier struggled to find an investor who can take a moonshot bet without expecting immediate results, are now flooded with investment offers“Burning out trying to raise money happens more often than from raising too much money.",['the Federal Reserve'],"['$30 million', '$200 million', '$1 billion', '$2.5 billion', '$4.5 billion', '$2 billion', '$5.7 billion', '$1 million', '$10 million', '$3.2 billion']"

Mensa Brands becomes India’s fastest unicorn with $135-million funding,16 November,"Mensa Brands, founded by former Myntra CEO Ananth Narayanan, has raised $135 million in fresh funding, which valued the six-month-old venture at over a billion dollars. This makes it the fastest Indian start-up to become a ‘unicorn’.Moneycontrol had first reported on talks of Mensa becoming a unicorn on October 4. Mensa runs a model similar to the US-based Thrasio, which buys profitable, well-reviewed online sellers on Amazon and turbocharges their growth with technology, marketing and product growth chops.This $135-million Series B funding round was led by its existing investor Falcon Edge Capital, along with other existing investors like Accel, Norwest and Tiger Global Management. Prosus (Naspers) is the new entrant in the league.Mensa has acquired 12 brands so far in categories such as designer sarees, jewellery, men’s wear, smart devices and personal care. Most of these brands are growing 100 percent year-on-year since the time of acquisition, the company said.“Our deep focus on technology and digital brand building, as well as our people, has allowed us to grow three times our initial plan and we, at Mensa Brands, are primed to build global breakout brands from India. I am especially proud that more than 50 percent of our brands are led by women founders and that Mensa supports small and medium sized businesses across the country,” Narayanan said.Mensa, which said it is profitable, has raised over $300 million in equity or debt so far. Debt is a key tool to acquire companies since it is cheaper than equity.Mensa is among the best-funded players in the ecommerce rollup space in India, competing with GlobalBees, Upscalio and GOAT Brand Labs. GlobalBees is also in talks to raise funds.“Mensa demonstrates a tangible uplift through a combination of product and pricing optimisation, technology-led process improvement, distribution and marketing augmentation and fine-tuning the supply chain.

Governance is more important than valuations: A91 Partners,12 November,"If a founder is reading this, you should know that A91 Partners will not send you an investment offer (term sheet) in one day, or after one meeting, and rush to close a deal over a weekend, as is the trend these days . The practice of spending serious time with entrepreneurs before and after an investment, can be seen as a commitment to active ownership-not being mere money bags- or seen as a relic of an older time, when unicorns were less common than cows in India.But if anything, A91- an investor in growth stage startups, prides itself on spending this time. This is why they struck out on their own, in fact. The joke goes that in a resume, the only brand stronger than Sequoia Capital is ex-Sequoia Capital. VT Bharadwaj, Gautam Mago and Abhay Pandey, who left Sequoia India as partners in 2017 and 2018, would know. Between the three of them, their Sequoia portfolio included hotel chain Oyo, paint maker Indigo Paints, beer-maker Bira91, Fogg deodorant parent Vini Cosmetics. A91 raised a $350 million first fund in 2019, betting on companies such as Digit Insurance, news aggregator InShorts and lender Aye Finance.Its investment in Digit has already grown four times, others are on track for more. A91’s portfolio makes for interesting reading- firms like SUGAR Cosmetics, InShorts and Paper Boat attract most investors. But their lesser known bets, on spices-maker Pushp, dry-fruits firm Happilo and software firm Exotel round out a strategy hardly any other fund in India is pursuing, but many want to pursue- somewhere between venture capital and private equity.Now, armed with a second fund of $550 million, Bharadwaj and Pandey joined Zoom from A91’s plush office in Worli, while Mago joined later on from Trident Hotel, BKC. In their first interview since leaving Sequoia, they spoke about having strong beliefs when the venture industry is sitting on record but uncertain returns, tackling governance issues, the promise and perils of the Thrasio model and reflected on life after Sequoia. The interview was edited for clarity and context.It is a very interesting time to raise a fund. A91 has not always gone after the hot deals but hot deals or not, what is your reading on the market?Abhay: It is (an interesting time), but it’s not like we timed the fund to raise it now. We have an investment cycle of 2-3 years. Therefore, irrespective of where the fund market was/is, our fund would have been raised about now. You’re right, we are at a time when capital flows into India are at an all time high. That makes our life as a fund manager more difficult. We are aware of that, and have to navigate that as we go along.We cannot ignore it. Neither can we get carried away by it or get paralysed by it, saying, “what do we do now?'' We have a mandate from our LPs and we have to stick to that.Sure. What was the rationale to raise a larger fund? Traditionally, it has been very hard to return large funds in India, and I thought $350 million in 2019 was your ideal fund size.Abhay: It is very hard to predict 3 years out what the ideal fund size should be. We would have thought 350, plus or minus 20% would be the size, due to the nature of the market. But, the last three years have been dramatically different. Everyone’s belief in the India opportunity is significantly higher, led largely by much better quality people turning entrepreneurs and capital willing to be more supportive. The belief that outcomes can be much larger is playing on everyone’s mind. None of us would have imagined Zomato to be a Rs 1 lakh crore + company today. We’ve been surprised with the upside.So what could have been a $15-$20 million Series B can now be a $20-$25 million Series B (sidenote: at a time when Series A rounds are even going into three figures). Our first fund had 13 companies. This fund will have 15-19. Put these together, the size inflation and number of deals takes us to a larger fund size. We could not have seen this earlier. But we learn and react to the market.VT: From an absolute amount of capital per company point of view, in the first fund we had said $20-$25 million. And, as we look at practical experience, the truth is that it has been closer to 25. So eventually, including follow ons we will have $25-30 million per company. We’re trying to make prudent choices and I hope we are proven right. It looks like the first fund’s size was right.Do you have a deal pipeline?Abhay: Oh there is a big pipeline out there. We will try to get into the best companies at what we think are appropriate valuations. The founders may decide otherwise (laughs) but I should admit we are looking at high quality companies that surprise us all the time. But we have to ensure our returns are not compromised- you can stretch the valuation, given the quality of companies, but you can stretch only to a certain level. Therefore, it is possible- and it has happened a few times in the last six months that we put our best foot forward but that’s not been good enough.Thirdly, availability of capital also makes it harder to understand who are the founders who have a persistence to build a business that’s enduring over a long period of time, where there will be ups and downs.But we think of ourselves as hey, we are around. We’re here (seemingly) forever. And this is private capital that will be available to our founders to build over many years. So, we have to tell our founders that we have patience, we have experience and have seen this type of movie play out before. So hopefully you will have the advantage of having someone like us, if you choose us.What stands out about A91 is that you have strong beliefs. About genuinely wanting to be more than capital, about being partners, not just taking bets. But the current market is rewarding completely different things- short term growth, immediate valuations. If you want to back a great founder, and the founder’s beliefs diverge from yours, how do you deal with that?Abhay: It is not that we know everything, Sriram. We also learn. What we put out there is beliefs based on what we have seen over years of investing together. If we see things that are very different from our beliefs but are working, would we be open to changing our beliefs? Absolutely. It is foolish to say we know everything, that’s not true. We will have to change our beliefs if there is strong evidence of things working the other way.Some of the fundamentals of business, all else equal, don’t change. But say we believe that a good way of building a business is by raising no more than $100 million. But today suddenly if the size of the market opportunity can be expanded, and the entrepreneur wants to raise $200 million, we have to change, because the size of outcomes is changing. If you can show a larger market it is okay to go after that.But building a team around you, not being a solo person, that should not change.Your portfolio looks largely stable, a bit closer to private equity than VC. The downside though is that you don’t have a company that will become a unicorn and decacorn in months. Will you have to take more risk from Fund 2?VT: First of all, if you think we are stable I’m glad to hear it! Because over our years of investing we have seen enough surprises. See, we are looking to build enduring businesses. It has to be enduring. Now, do we want them to be hugely successful in a short period of time? Of course! It would be crazy if we didn’t. We would be thrilled to have an investment that gets very big very fast. But the principle is still for a business to endure. As a team we have to convince ourselves that this company will be up and running, maybe not today, but in the next 3,5,7 years and more.When you look at Fund 1 and see your plans for Fund 2, what would you say you did right, and what could you have done better?Abhay: We think about it all the time. What we did right was we constructed a portfolio sticking to our thesis and what we had told our LPs- getting into high quality companies with a chance of making returns of over 5x. We’re seeing some investments look better than that already.What we debate though, is our misses, and what we could have done better. There were companies we saw and passed, either because we did not believe the trajectory they were projecting or the market opportunity they were chasing- or in some cases the valuation they were asking. In retrospect, there are 3-4 companies that, in spite of their trajectory or valuation, have played out much better than we thought. We blame ourselves for missing those.We should do a better job of looking into the future or spending time to understand them and their aspirations better. We had some biases of our past, having seen similar businesses which didn’t grow in the past, and that may have affected our thinking. Which is where we open up and say, okay, this is possible. We are coming from a time when (revenues of) 0 to 100 crore used to take 5 years. Now, it can take 18 months or less. So we can’t get stuck to a philosophyVT: One thing we have done well, we promised our founders and investors a focused portfolio. We will give undivided attention to every company we invest in. And that’s a promise we will continue to make. We are here for your journey, and what matters to you matters to us. Because it is a concentrated, focused portfolio, relative to everything else.How do you stay relevant in the market? What if the founder says, I don’t need your time, I need your capital, and let me work with that?Abhay: Anybody who doesn’t ask this question, about staying relevant is making a mistake. There are examples in every business, of people thinking they are well set, doing well, and they disappear. They don’t matter. What we ask is, 10 years later if A91 failed, what would the reasons for that be? That’s a very important pre-post-mortem, if you will. And, therefore while we want to add value to every portfolio company, the company may not want that and we have to be flexible.With the speed of deals, high valuations for unproven companies, lots of money around, do you worry about governance issues at companies?Abhay: In general, we are less concerned about governance than ten years ago. Today, we are generally backing first generation entrepreneurs with backgrounds similar to ours. Having said that, there are enough instances of people like us getting carried away by the environment of surpluses. You have to be careful about it but it is not something we spent sleepless nights on.VT: Human beings are human beings, so in times of greed and excesses you are bound to see challenging practices. You have to be watchful. We have always had the chance to do diligence, even with founders we have known for many years. From an ecosystem standpoint, governance is an even more important metric than valuations.Abhay: But we have a role to play and that should not be undermined. Governance lapses that happen today are not about people taking money from the company. It is about creating structures where ownership may be disproportionate or there may be misaligned interests. For example, starting a subsidiary and having a stake in that outside of the main company.At a time when everything is getting marked up and investments are looking good, investors usually turn the other way, saying hey it’s all good, I’m nicely in the money. So if the founder is doing something inappropriate they say it’s okay. You have to say, it is not okay.Is it harder to ask the founder tough questions- not just governance but even disagreements in general, when the founder is making your investment worth a lot more?Gautam: It is harder, but you also put yourself in the shoes of the founder. The founder is reacting to what is happening in the market. Company X and Y are competing, and Y is spending more than X. X may be more efficient, but it is hard to be dramatically more efficient. It is about competitive dynamics as well.Fundamentally, founders run companies and investors are there to be a sounding board and sanity check. It is always yin and yang. If someone is running a business and sees an opportunity you have to trust them. But the human mind is a mysterious thing, which can see opportunities where there are none. And none when there are some. It is more difficult because the level of competition in the market is making it more difficult.VT and Abhay, both of you have invested in many consumer brands over the years, even before D2C (Direct to consumer) became a buzzword. What do you make of this D2C revolution? And is the online retail market big enough for so many players?VT: The word D2C is used in so many different contexts, it is difficult to pin down what it means. We define it a bit more broadly that it is a consumer brand which began its journey digital first, serving customers either through their own channels or marketplaces (Flipkart, Amazon etc) and use that as an opportunity to build a broad-based consumer brand.While people may start saying I will only sell online or on my channel, the smarter founders are saying, look I will build a consumer brand. So I will use my customer insights and ability to develop products to build a large business. But eventually it will not matter to me how many of my customers reach out and buy online or offline. And it may start online, where I’m using my own marketing, use Facebook or Google etc, but many of these brands are now advertising on Hotstar, TV and IPL right?So, I think consumer entrepreneurs have done exactly that. They have used digital to build an early understanding of the category, brand, product and relationship with customers, but build across all channels and mediums, because eventually you don’t know how many customers will access your product via which medium. I don’t think anyone smart is being dogmatic saying I will sell only online because then your success is a function of how big online retail is. The digital consumer founder is saying I will sell whichever channel- general or modern trade- can take my product. And finding that out is key.What are the risks for these brands?VT: The risks to scale are product relevance and price points. Also to not get caught up about channels. To see it as broad-based and see, am I present in every way in which I can reach the customer- whether it is Amazon, Swiggy Instamart or my kirana store. And how my economics and math will work across all channels. So pick your spot. If you say I’ll sell only here, that has implications on your relevance.Second is competition. Competitive intensity is highest if you are only digital or only own channel. That is inevitable. But if you’re starting there, see how you can quickly expand and navigate the market you’re serving and become a large business. These are the only two questions you have to answer.What is your advice to portfolio founders today?Abhay: One certainly is, if you have a capital raise plan in the next 6-12 months, raise it now. Do not get carried away with spending the capital. Because customer acquisition costs are getting high and will remain high because of the amount of capital every company has. Look for smarter ways to acquire customers, leverage existing platforms rather than doing it from your own channel. And hold on to your best people. Because talent is the area which is getting more and more affected today, people are being poached away with ESOPs and high compensations. Speak and be in touch with your best performing talent, make sure they have ESOPs, understand their role and relevance in the organisation, and can see their future in the organisation.Where do you sit on the Thrasio model, one of the hottest consumer spaces today?Abhay: We are intrigued. We haven’t invested but that doesn’t mean we are not looking at a couple of them. It is a combination of being a very good investor or M&A person; and to be able to add value and take it to the next level. We are applying a strong lens on, can you pick well-- because there is a lot out there, doesn’t mean you can buy anything.It is fine to buy revenue and raise money (based) on that but you have to ensure companies are buying good quality, or even reasonable quality assets, because good assets are very hard to buy. And then what multiples can you get, because you are betting on the value you can add. That’s a question we are taking seriously. If we haven’t invested it, it is to pause and see some proof of concept. Both these skills (investor and operator/adding value) are not that straightforwardVT: One implication of the activity in that space has been that small companies are reaching out to our portfolio companies. They have offers from Thrasio-type companies and they are considering whether they should sell to someone bigger than them who is building something similar, or become part of another operating company- and which of them knows how to work with founders? That is what has traditionally been missing in India- founders don’t want to sell to a traditional company, but are quite happy to work with a new-age modern company. So, we also have to evaluate whether it makes sense for our portfolio companies.How is life different for you now, compared to Sequoia?Silence for about 10 seconds. VT laughs saying, it’s been so long since we have been asked this. Silence for 10 seconds againVT: We are founders, trying to build an enduring business ourselves. And that is the lens with which every decision gets taken. We are in this long journey of building a special institution from India. It is challenging, it is very hard and there are lots of questions we have to ask ourselves, but it is a different experience.Abhay: We are certainly thinking more long term now, than while you’re at a platform- where, as an investor you still think long term, but it is still a ‘job’ if you will. If Sequoia made a mistake, there would be an impact on individuals, but the franchise was not affected. There were professionals, and then there was Sequoia, the franchise.There isn’t much of a difference between A91 and us. You are more responsible for your actions and therefore have to be more thoughtful about anything you do over the longer term. There is greater responsibility. You also feel more excited about successes because there is greater ownership.But in a large franchise, the extent of support and the ecosystem around you is much larger. You have wider access to people and service providers. The brand is more powerful, because it has been built over 50 years. We have to make sure that whatever personal brand and credibility we have gets into A91 and builds from hereon. We were drawing from Sequoia. We are giving to A91. You call someone and say I’m from A91, they say, who A91? That would never happen with Sequoia. That’s something you miss in your early days.Gautam: We are trying to be an Indian venture capital firm and there aren’t too many templates for that. You have to forge your own path more.At Sequoia there were much larger factors at play, more capital if needed, internal pressures, and a larger team. Did it take you time to find the right investing pace with A91?Abhay: When we started we put together how many deals me, VT and Gautam had done, how often we were meeting entrepreneurs, liking them, and investing. And we decided the fund size based on that. So whatever we did at Sequoia over 10 years, we chose some average of that. Our current pace is not super different from what we were doing at Sequoia.What is your biggest challenge today?Abhay: When you have a good start, things are going well, the market is super buoyant, there is a risk of getting carried away, saying we got it, we know this. And that’s a very very dangerous place to be.Secondly, times are changing and the world is changing around us. To not be cognisant of that, be super stuck around your beliefs saying these are my learnings and I will keep getting stuck to these learnings- if you get stuck to logos, saying here’s a good deal from 2015, or 2017 can be dangerous. We have to learn and evolve as the market evolves.VT: There is India opportunity and there is India reality. How do you make sure you are constantly processing both to make the right decisions? I think about that a lot. And second is what Abhay said, and it is worth repeating, about constantly learning. Investing is a brutal business.

Exclusive: Edtech Teachmint rolls out unique ESOP plan,11 November,"Online education infrastructure startup Teachmint has launched a program which will let employees sell their shares as soon as they are eligible and give them more financial leeway, a key move to retain people amid a war for talent in the startup space.This plan is meant to give employees more control over their finances and remove the back-room drama that often follows ESOP share sales in India.The Continuous Liquidity Plan ensures that as long as employee shares are vested, they can sell them whenever they want, rather than when the company raises money, when investors decide to buy back or when the founders decide- as is generally the norm, Teachmint’s co-founder and CEO Mihir Gupta told MoneycontrolEmployee Stock Option Plans are gaining traction at startups, with IPOs and secondary share sales leading to employees making many times their annual salary from stock sales, ranging from lakhs to hundreds of crores. 16-month-old Teachmint, backed by investors such as Lightspeed India issues ESOPs to each of its 154 employes will continue doing so, underscoring the importance of the tool“We are doing this so that ESOPs stop being a hypothetical number and create actual meaningful wealth which can make a difference to a team member’s life. This becomes a comparable proposition to a public company which would offer tradeable ESOPs,” Gupta said.ESOPs have a vesting schedule, where at the end of each month/year, a certain portion of shares ‘vest’- meaning the employee can sell those shares. However even vested shares often take time- if ever to become actual cash, as the company or its investors need to buy back those shares, have money in the bank to do that, and the valuation at which employees can sell shares is sometimes a bone of contention as well. Sometimes companies buy employees shares at a steep discount to the original valuation.Teachmint is however offering these ESOP buybacks at a valuation of $500 million, the same as its funding round of $78 million recently.Teachmint’s ESOPs are structured in such a way that after an employee completes one year, he is eligible to sell 25 percent of his shares, a figure that goes to 50, 75 and 100 percent in the following 3 years.It has a total ESOP pool of $30 million, but since it is a young startup, most employees don’t have vested shares yet, and the new tool is built to give them financial freedom in the future. For instance if a person needs a lumpsum for an emergency, life event or vacation, they can sell their shares, rather than waiting for when the company raises money, as is usually the norm.Teachmint will ensure that employees can sell shares whenever they want by keeping aside money for share sales each year as part of its annual budget, so that buybacks are not tied to fundraisers or whims of any investor or founder.Curiously though, the move may incentivise employees to sell shares earlier than they otherwise would, reducing their will to stay longer at Teachmint and maybe leading to higher employee turnover, something most companies don’t want.Gupta however said that this is unlikely to happen. “People do deliver considerable value in 2-3 years. While someone staying for 4-5 years is ideal, it is becoming rare in the tech industry. You have to account for churn and still reward employees,” he said.Besides IPOs such as Zomato, Nykaa and Policybazaar, where ESOP holders make handsome returns, other privately held startups have also done ESOP buybacks aggregating to hundreds of million of dollars in the last 18 months. At most growth to late stage companies, an ESOP buyback has become a standard feature alongside a large fundraise. Startups which have done this include CRED, Urban Company, Moglix, Razorpay, Licious, Whatfix and Zerodha.Similar to Teachmint, food delivery firm Swiggy last month launched a $35-40 million ESOP plan , where employees will be able to tender shares they hold in the company twice over the next two years, in a move to create more visibility and transparency",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/startup/exclusive-edtech-teachmint-rolls-out-unique-esop-plan-7703711.html,Funding,"Online education infrastructure startup Teachmint has launched a program which will let employees sell their shares as soon as they are eligible and give them more financial leeway, a key move to retain people amid a war for talent in the startup space.This plan is meant to give employees more control over their finances and remove the back-room drama that often follows ESOP share sales in India.The Continuous Liquidity Plan ensures that as long as employee shares are vested, they can sell them whenever they want, rather than when the company raises money, when investors decide to buy back or when the founders decide- as is generally the norm, Teachmint’s co-founder and CEO Mihir Gupta told MoneycontrolEmployee Stock Option Plans are gaining traction at startups, with IPOs and secondary share sales leading to employees making many times their annual salary from stock sales, ranging from lakhs to hundreds of crores.Sometimes companies buy employees shares at a steep discount to the original valuation.Teachmint is however offering these ESOP buybacks at a valuation of $500 million, the same as its funding round of $78 million recently.Teachmint’s ESOPs are structured in such a way that after an employee completes one year, he is eligible to sell 25 percent of his shares, a figure that goes to 50, 75 and 100 percent in the following 3 years.It has a total ESOP pool of $30 million, but since it is a young startup, most employees don’t have vested shares yet, and the new tool is built to give them financial freedom in the future.","['Teachmint', 'ESOP', 'The Continuous Liquidity Plan', 'Teachmint’s', 'MoneycontrolEmployee Stock Option Plans', 'ESOP', 'Teachmint’s', 'ESOP']","['$500 million', '$78 million', '$30 million', 'hundreds of million of dollars', '$35-40 million']"

"Zomato to deploy $1 billion over 1-2 years in startup investments, picks stakes in Shiprocket, Magicpin and Curefit",10 November,"Online food delivery platform Zomato on November 10 announced a $175 million investment across three homegrown startups — Shiprocket, Curefit and Magicpin — with an aim to diversify its bets following a blockbuster public listing.It further plans to deploy another $1 billion over the next 1-2 years, with a major focus on the quick commerce space.Moneycontrol had first reported that Zomato was in talks to invest $75 million in Shiprocket. Earlier on November 10, Moneycontrol was also the first to report that the company had a larger plan of making investments across a clutch of startups including Magicpin.While the Shiprocket funding is part of a $185 million round which the company is raising, Curefit and Magicpin's are standalone equity rounds.Moneycontrol had reported about the Curefit deal also earlier on November 10 adding that this deal will get it a unicorn tag.Calling it a brutal prioritisation, the company said it would divest or shut down any businesses which were not driving ""exponential value"" for its shareholders.It plans to invest in core food and the ecosystem surrounding it to make it a robust long term value driver. The aim is to build a hyperlocal e-commerce ecosystem by investing and partnering with other companies beyond the food sector.While Zomato stated that it aspired to become a $10 billion business, it didn't give a timeline for the same.""We believe that the food delivery market in India is still nascent, and there is an opportunity to grow the market at least 10x over the next few years. In order to make this happen, we are going to continue investing heavily in market creation, in addition to investing in ecosystem companies around our food delivery business so that the cost of running a better food delivery business goes down with time,"" Founder and CEO Deepinder Goyal said in its quarterly earnings.""We are currently in talks with various restaurant point-of-sale (POS) players, e-vehicle fleet operators, among others, to evaluate investments in these companies keeping the long term in mind,"" he added.Founded in 2012, the parent firm of Shiprocket has seen multiple pivots over the years.

The valuation around that time was pegged at $850-900 million.In August, Moneycontrol reported that Nagori was in talks to raise Rs 100 crore to build a house of food and cloud-kitchen brands. This came nearly a year after Nagori swapped his stake in Cure.fit to take control of its cloud kitchen arm Eat.fit.As part of this round, Zomato which had acquired Fitso for around $13 million earlier this year is selling it to Curefit for a valuation of $50 million. Besides this, Zomato is investing $50 million in cash in Curefit. Cumulatively it will give Zomato a shareholding of 6.4 percent in Curefit.As per this, Curefit's valuation stands at a sharp $1.5 billion.Magicpin on the other hand was founded in  2016 by Anshoo Sharma and Brij Bhushan and connects hyperlocal merchants and brands with consumers.Earlier this year, Ritesh Agarwal, founder of Oyo, had led a small round in Magicpin which gave the company a valuation of $165 million.

Exclusive: Insurance startup Turtlemint eyes unicorn tag after Policybazaar IPO,10 November,"Turtlemint, an online platform for buying insurance, is in talks to raise about $200 million, valuing it at over $1 billion – over five times its previous valuation – the latest internet startup to benefit from a funding boom, people said.Tiger Global Management, among other investors, is in talks to lead the funding round, although the terms are yet uncertain and could change, the people added. One person said that Tiger may not invest but other investors are interested.Tiger declined to comment while  Turtlemint did not respond to queries from Moneycontrol.Founded by Dhirendra Mahyavanshi and Anand Prabhudesai, former employees of classifieds startup Quikr, Turtlemint started by providing an online platform for insurance agents to join and sell auto, health and life insurance. The company has adopted an online-to-offline model.It has over 120,000 advisors who are on track to generate $54 million in revenue in FY22, according to a version of Turtlemint’s investor documents viewed by Moneycontrol.Turtlemint will collect total premiums of $234 million in FY22 and wants this figure to grow to $2.5 billion by FY25, which is projected to bring in revenue of $350 million. It also plans to go public in FY25, the documents said.In FY20, the last year for which its numbers are publicly available, Turtlemint made a profit of Rs 3.6 crore while its revenue doubled to Rs 46.8 crore.It has added a software platform that third-party insurers or banks can use to sell insurance in a plug-and-play model (called Turtlefin) and has expanded this to the United Arab Emirates.Turtlemint’s fundraising comes as larger rival Policybazaar concluded a Rs 5,700 crore initial public offering that was subscribed over 16 times at a valuation of about $6 billion, higher than the most aggressive estimates for the company's share sale. While Policybazaar has so far sold insurance online, it got an insurance broking licence from the regulator in June, allowing it to enter the offline segment and compete with Turtlemint.Turtlemint’s pitch to investors is that it is not merely an offline distribution platform, but a technology company whose network and consumer base helps assess risk better, generates higher leads, disburses information faster and issues policies quicker.Turtlemint has raised over $75 million so far, most recently from Jungle Ventures and GGV Capital. Its other investors include Sequoia India, Nexus Venture Partners and Blume Ventures. The company was valued at over $200 million in March this year, people aware of the matter said.“They have raised a lot of money in the last two years. They haven’t burnt much money but I don’t see why Policybazaar cannot out-execute them,” said an investor tracking the company, requesting anonymity.People close to Turtlemint, however, said that it has honed its skills over the years by providing specialised content for sales agents, setting up a wide network, and more recently, using the software-as-a-service model to enable end-to-end sales and renewals.While online insurance has been growing for the past decade, the Covid-19 pandemic boosted digital adoption. Sales agents became adept at video calls along with consumers browsing and buying insurance online. Online insurer Acko was valued at over $1 billion recently, in addition to Policybazaar and Digit, which are mature companies.""If Policybazaar can be valued at $6 billion, Turtlemint can argue for a billion dollar valuation. But stock market prices are volatile. It can fall by half in a few weeks if markets turn. So it may not be the right benchmark,"" an investor in the space said, requesting anonymity.Investors are betting that India, so far a sparsely insured nation, will start buying more insurance and online. About 4.3 percent of India is insured, compared with the global average of 7.4 percent, Moneycontrol reported.Life insurance penetration stood at 3.2 percent, while non-life insurance penetration at 1 percent. India’s insurance density, which is the premium per capita, stood at $78 in FY21, less than one-tenth the world average for insurance density at $809.More early-stage startups such as Plum Insurance, Verak, Onsurity and Loop Health have also seen increased investor interest. Tiger Global, with whom Turtlemint has had conversations, is also an investor in Policybazaar and Plum, a group insurance startup.In 2021 so far, India has produced over 35 unicorns- the moniker for startups valued at over a billion dollars- once a rare breed. Internet startups have raised over $25 billion in nine months this year, more than double what they raised in entire previous years.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/startup/exclusive-insurance-startup-turtlemint-eyes-unicorn-tag-after-policybazaar-ipo-7698291.html,Funding,"It also plans to go public in FY25, the documents said.In FY20, the last year for which its numbers are publicly available, Turtlemint made a profit of Rs 3.6 crore while its revenue doubled to Rs 46.8 crore.It has added a software platform that third-party insurers or banks can use to sell insurance in a plug-and-play model (called Turtlefin) and has expanded this to the United Arab Emirates.Turtlemint’s fundraising comes as larger rival Policybazaar concluded a Rs 5,700 crore initial public offering that was subscribed over 16 times at a valuation of about $6 billion, higher than the most aggressive estimates for the company's share sale.While Policybazaar has so far sold insurance online, it got an insurance broking licence from the regulator in June, allowing it to enter the offline segment and compete with Turtlemint.Turtlemint’s pitch to investors is that it is not merely an offline distribution platform, but a technology company whose network and consumer base helps assess risk better, generates higher leads, disburses information faster and issues policies quicker.Turtlemint has raised over $75 million so far, most recently from Jungle Ventures and GGV Capital.","['Policybazaar', 'Policybazaar', 'Turtlemint', 'Jungle Ventures', 'GGV Capital']","['about $200 million', 'over $1 billion', '$54 million', '$234 million', '$2.5 billion', '$350 million', 'about $6 billion', 'over $75 million', 'over $200 million', 'over $1 billion', '$6 billion', 'billion dollar', '78', '809.More', 'over $25 billion']"

Byju's to raise $1.2 billion in debt through TLB round,08 November,"India’s most valued startup Byju’s is raising $1.2 billion through a term loan B (TLB) funding.Moneycontrol reported in August that the company was in initial stage to raise $500 million via a TLB and that it had started working with Morgan Stanley.According to sources, while the company planned to raise $500 million, the round got upsized following increased investor appetite.In a filing, the company has disclosed it will utilise this money for general corporate purposes.TLB refers to a tranche of senior secured syndicated credit facilities from global institutional investors.With this round, Byju's becomes the second company to have raised a TLB in India. Oyo was the first company to have raised this debt.Conventionally, TLB proceeds are used either to refinance the existing debts by a company or to make overseas acquisitions with an aim to enhance their offerings.This happens at a time when the company is gearing up for an initial public offering.In an interaction with Moneycontrol in July, Byju Raveendran, founder and chief executive officer of Byju’s said that the company was considering a 12-18 months timeline for an IPO.Byju’s, which has spent over $2 billion in acquisitions in the last six months, also has plans for a couple of more acquisitions to drive international expansion.In July, it acquired upskilling platform Great Learning for $600 million and plans to invest $400 million more in this segment, as it looks to expand its education services globally across categories.Earlier in 2021, the company also acquired US-based reading platform Epic, educational games maker Osmo, coding startup WhiteHat Jr and offline test preparation firm Aakash Educational Services Limited.

"Current startup valuations not sustainable, need to be careful says Investcorp India partner",08 November,"Bahrain-based private equity investor Investcorp is looking to raise $400-500 million for investing in India, at a time when the  country’s venture capital and technology space has exploded,  fuelling fears of a bubble. Gaurav Sharma, partner at the private equity practice of Investcorp, is doubling down, yet cautious of the technology space. “There’s no room for multiple companies in a particular sector. Some of them, in my view, will not survive. There will be a shakeout in the next couple of years. So, in this vintage, as an investor you have to be very careful,” he said in an interview with Moneycontrol.“If you look at the tech deals we did last year – (ecommerce logistics firm) Xpressbees, (online meat retailer) FreshToHome, and (enterprise software provider) Unilog – we moved very quickly after the first wave,” he said. “We came into solid companies with solid fundamentals at decent valuations versus the last six months. We haven’t done any tech deals because it is not easy for us to wrap our heads around the valuations right now,” Sharma said.Investcorp acquired IDFC’s private equity business in India in 2019 and has almost fully deployed its first $300 million India fund. It is a mid-market private equity firm, focusing on healthcare, pharma, software and consumer technology. Even though investors are cautious about the high valuations and free-flowing capital, they still want to enter good companies at reasonable valuations – a hard ask at the moment.“We’re also facing the problem. Even in our portfolio, companies raising money have a problem of plenty and some investors are left out. So, from that point of view, it’s good but as a potential investor, it is hard, yes. See, we have to be patient. We don’t have to invest right now. Across private equity, some vintages do well and some vintages don’t. The current frenzy does not create the best vintage,” he said.“Right now, we don’t have to do sectors where every investor is running. So companies in pharma, healthcare, non-tech sectors, FMCG, packaged food companies which are doing well but are a little below the radar. We have to search for those in this environment,” he added.Private equity firms generally take more concentrated and focused bets than venture firms, which means their portfolios are meant to be more stable, with no obvious failures, but they may also miss the spectacular hits and quadrupling valuations in months that VCs sometimes see.“We are not going to a company raising $500 million and, say, let’s throw our hat in the ring and see what happens. You can’t approach private equity like that,” he said. Investcorp also helps its portfolio companies launch operations abroad, given its network of investors in the US, Europe and the Middle East. For this reason, it is also looking for export-oriented pharma companies.“For instance, we have expanded (dialysis chain) Nephroplus into the Philippines, launching soon in Uzbekistan, hoping to enter the Gulf GCC region as well. We are looking at companies which have the right R&D to launch generics and complex generics in the US and Europe, regulated markets. Pharma exports are a huge opportunity,” Sharma said.While the overall funding boom helps companies grow faster, hire more and expand, it holds risks as well. Many investors cut cheques in breakneck speed during a boom, but are the first ones to retreat when the tide turns.“Certain investors work in a certain manner and they have been successful doing that, but yeah, I can’t work like that. It is very good that this much capital is coming into India. But what I don’t want is that this leads to a blow-up where the overall market suffers. Once there is a shock in the market, then even the good companies don’t get funded. That herd mentality does not go away, whether it is pumping money or withdrawing. Everyone does it together.” According to Sharma, the fund is on track to return 4-5 times of the invested capital back to investors (limited partners), and is confident of generating the same returns from a larger fund too. More than Multiple on Invested Capital (MOIC), PE and VC fund performance is measured by Internal Rate of Returns, the fund’s rate of return adjusted for inflation and compared to other asset classes. “From an INR point of view, we have to underwrite north of 30 percent (IRR), so we can get to about 30 percent on a US dollar level because there is some rupee depreciation you have to take into account,” he said.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/startup/current-startup-valuations-not-sustainable-need-to-be-careful-says-investcorp-india-partner-7679891.html,Funding,"We have to search for those in this environment,” he added.Private equity firms generally take more concentrated and focused bets than venture firms, which means their portfolios are meant to be more stable, with no obvious failures, but they may also miss the spectacular hits and quadrupling valuations in months that VCs sometimes see.“We are not going to a company raising $500 million and, say, let’s throw our hat in the ring and see what happens.Everyone does it together.” According to Sharma, the fund is on track to return 4-5 times of the invested capital back to investors (limited partners), and is confident of generating the same returns from a larger fund too.",[],"['$400-500 million', '$300 million', '$500 million']"
Explained: Sequoia Capital’s new disruptive structure. What has prompted it?,27 October,"Sequoia Capital Operations LLC, the world’s oldest and one of the most successful venture capital (VC) firms, with early investments in companies ranging from Google and Apple to Airbnb, Stripe and ByteDance, is disrupting its own business model before anyone else does so.Sequoia’s United States and European funds will now be clubbed under a single large fund with no holding period. The announcement by Sequoia’s partner Roelof Botha demonstrates both Sequoia’s enormous clout and the rapidly shifting dynamics in private investment and the need to stay relevant.What does the move entail?On Wednesday, October 26, Sequoia said it was consolidating all its US and European venture funds into a single fund — the Sequoia Fund, an investment vehicle which, unlike all other VC funds, will not have a timeline in which to return money to investors. Limited Partners (LPs), or investors in Sequoia — pension funds, university endowments, and billionaire family offices — will invest in The Sequoia Fund, which will in turn invest in sub-funds across stages — seed, venture, and growth.Why is it doing this?“This new structure removes all artificial time horizons on how long we can partner with companies. It enables us to participate on their boards and help them realize their potential over the course of decades,” Botha wrote.For decades, VC firms have had 7-10 year fund structures, the timeline in which they have to show returns to LPs. So while the first two to three years of a fund are spent deploying the money raised, year five onwards is generally spent finding an exit path — selling a buyer or by listing.Most VC firms need to show exits and close the fund in seven to eight years. Top funds can extend this timeline to 10-11 years, but hardly ever beyond that.The new structure will do away with all expiry dates. Botha cited the example of Twitter co-founder and CEO Jack Dorsey’s payments firm Square, which Sequoia first backed in 2011. It went public in 2015 at a valuation of $2.9 billion. During or soon after an initial public offering (IPO), investors generally sell a part of their stake. Five years later, Square was worth $86 billion, and now it is valued at over $117 billion.As companies stay private longer and technology envelops our lives more than ever, Sequoia does not want the pressure of returning money within a certain timeline when it can make spectacularly more amounts of money simply by holding on, or in some cases even doubling down later.Especially in the last two to three years, technology company valuations have skyrocketed. Tesla, worth less than $60 billion in 2018, is trading at over $1 trillion today.How does this change things?The Sequoia Fund can now hold on to its best performing companies, even after listing, for much longer. The holding period will last until whenever it deems fit, and gives the firm tremendous control over its own destiny.Are Sequoia’s LPs okay with this? Couldn’t it be riskier for them?The traditional 10-year VC model was set up in the 1960s, and until now, was meant to ensure funds return money regularly to LPs, and to ensure VCs are responsible. That hasn’t been an issue with Sequoia, whose record in the US and China are particularly enviable, with landmark early bets on defining companies. In fact one week last year fetched $9 billion for Sequoia’s US unit in IPOs, and that continued as Airbnb, Freshworks and other firms went public.“For nearly five decades, we have delivered unparalleled performance to our limited partners, with capital distributions meaningfully outpacing capital calls,” Botha wrote.Have other VCs done this?Not yet. Even among the top VCs, very few likely have the brand, power and credibility of Sequoia to be able to pull off such a unique structure, upending the venture capital model itself.Sequoia is also becoming a registered investment advisor (RIA), rather than just a VC; the new moniker gives it broader leeway to invest in public stocks, secondary shares and cryptocurrency assets.Rival VCs Andreessen Horowitz and General Catalyst too became RIAs a couple of years ago.What about Sequoia’s China and India businesses?Those funds will work the same way as before, with 8-10 year funds, for now at least. While Sequoia China runs a hedge fund as well, Sequoia India has been run like a typical VC fund so far.Any other reason why Sequoia is doing this?While VCs have seen record returns in the last few years, competition has significantly increased too, from non-VC investors, first SoftBank, and more recently hedge funds such as Tiger Global Management, Insight Partners and Coatue Management. These funds have flexible strategies, move extremely quickly and are already raising more money than even the biggest VCs usually do.Maneuvers by Sequoia and others are also likely an attempt to stay on top of the game as competition rises and more money chases the same companies.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/explained-sequoia-capitals-new-disruptive-structure-what-has-prompted-it-7635201.html,Funding,"The announcement by Sequoia’s partner Roelof Botha demonstrates both Sequoia’s enormous clout and the rapidly shifting dynamics in private investment and the need to stay relevant.What does the move entail?On Wednesday, October 26, Sequoia said it was consolidating all its US and European venture funds into a single fund — the Sequoia Fund, an investment vehicle which, unlike all other VC funds, will not have a timeline in which to return money to investors.Even among the top VCs, very few likely have the brand, power and credibility of Sequoia to be able to pull off such a unique structure, upending the venture capital model itself.Sequoia is also becoming a registered investment advisor (RIA), rather than just a VC; the new moniker gives it broader leeway to invest in public stocks, secondary shares and cryptocurrency assets.Rival VCs Andreessen Horowitz and General Catalyst too became RIAs a couple of years ago.What about Sequoia’s China and India businesses?Those funds will work the same way as before, with 8-10 year funds, for now at least.","['Sequoia', 'Sequoia', 'Sequoia', 'the Sequoia Fund', 'VC', 'Sequoia', 'VC', 'General Catalyst', 'Sequoia']","['$2.9 billion', '$86 billion', 'over $117 billion', 'less than $60 billion', 'over $1 trillion', '$9 billion']"
Exclusive: Neobank Fi aims for $200-million valuation in new funding round,21 October,"Fi, a new-age app-only banking startup founded by former Google Pay executives, is in talks to raise about $50 million, taking its valuation fourfold to $200 million, said two people aware of the matter, requesting anonymity.Previously known as EpiFi, the startup is in talks with Falcon Edge Capital and B Capital to lead the round, while existing investors Sequoia India, Ribbit Capital and Hillhouse Capital will also participate, they said.While Fi does not have a banking licence, it has partnered with Federal Bank for customers to open bank accounts, while Fi runs the app and related services. Fi is among a slew of neobanking startups that seek to disrupt traditional banks, which are offline-heavy, often don’t have enough digital presence and run on stodgy and sometimes bureaucratic processes.Fi, Falcon Edge and B Capital did not respond to queries seeking comment.Founded by Sujith Narayanan and Sumit Gwalani in late 2019, Fi offers a zero-balance savings account, ways to monitor your expenditure and segregate it and create ‘jars’ for savings. It directly competes with Jupiter, another neobank founded by former Citrus Pay founder Jitendra Gupta. Both startups count Sequoia as a common investor.In the long term, these banks want to replace traditional banks, and make money from loans and investment products and card spends.Fi had last raised a seed funding of $13 million from Sequoia, Ribbit and others in January 2020 at a time consumer neobanks were all the rage and raising financing based on a thesis, without a product. Many of these cater to businesses while some like Fi cater to consumers. The Covid-19 pandemic delayed some of the consumer neobanks’ launch plans but Jupiter and Fi went live earlier this year.Fi has about 2 lakh users now while Jupiter has about 1.5 lakh, the people said, adding that Fi’s monthly cash burn was higher. Moneycontrol could not independently confirm this.One of the persons also added that a few months ago Fi was able to add more users due to a snag at Federal Bank, which partners both Jupiter and Fi. A user was allowed to open only one Federal Bank savings account, which meant if that person used Fi, he or she couldn’t use Jupiter and vice versa. Fi went on an aggressive marketing campaign, including TV ads, which helped rope in some early users.Federal Bank fixed the issue later and a consumer can use both now, but the hitch gave Fi an early leg-up, the person said.While Fi has seen early traction, the focus now will be on user retention and growth prospects. For instance, while neobanks will make money via commission on debit card spends, this is unlikely to be a significant revenue generator. Whether working professionals—Fi’s target customers—will make Fi their primary bank account for their salary, expenses and investments could determine its future prospects.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/startup/exclusive-neobank-fi-aims-for-200-million-valuation-in-new-funding-round-7606161.html,Funding,"Fi, a new-age app-only banking startup founded by former Google Pay executives, is in talks to raise about $50 million, taking its valuation fourfold to $200 million, said two people aware of the matter, requesting anonymity.Previously known as EpiFi, the startup is in talks with Falcon Edge Capital and B Capital to lead the round, while existing investors Sequoia India, Ribbit Capital and Hillhouse Capital will also participate, they said.While Fi does not have a banking licence, it has partnered with Federal Bank for customers to open bank accounts, while Fi runs the app and related services.Fi is among a slew of neobanking startups that seek to disrupt traditional banks, which are offline-heavy, often don’t have enough digital presence and run on stodgy and sometimes bureaucratic processes.Fi, Falcon Edge and B Capital did not respond to queries seeking comment.Founded by Sujith Narayanan and Sumit Gwalani in late 2019, Fi offers a zero-balance savings account, ways to monitor your expenditure and segregate it and create ‘jars’ for savings.","['Google Pay', 'EpiFi', 'Falcon Edge Capital', 'B Capital', 'Sequoia India', 'Ribbit Capital', 'Hillhouse Capital', 'Federal Bank', 'B Capital']","['about $50 million', '$200 million', '$13 million']"

"Sick of Zoom and vigilant of a third wave, VCs get back to in-person meetings, travel",19 October,"Startup investors, used to taking four flights a week for years, have sat at home for the past 18 months as the pandemic unfolded, watching their portfolio companies collapse and then bounce back with unexpected vigour, aided by an epic funding boom.Now, as Covid-19 abates in India, many of them are back to traveling with full fervour, meeting the founders of the companies they’ve invested in for the first time and finding out the joys and pains of an older world, even as the fear of a possible third wave lingers.Investors have committed billions of dollars sitting in their homes – startup funding crossed $20 billion in 2021. Yet, in a sector that’s driven by personal relationships, gut feel and instinct (or luck), physical meetings are still largely irreplaceable, except for introductions or cursory meetings.Bengaluru-based Ritesh Banglani, the managing partner at Stellaris Venture Partners, an early-stage investor, travelled to New Delhi last month and only when he met a portfolio company founder could he understand the extent of the startup’s growth, despite having been in touch throughout.“From the time we invested, they have gone from 5 to 75 people. That number is apparent only when you actually see them in office and it really strikes you how much the company has grown. It is hard to get the sense of scale only by looking at a graph on a Zoom call,” said Banglani.A Mumbai-based investor said that when he went to Bengaluru recently for the first time in almost two years, every single meeting of his, planned for one hour, stretched to about two hours. He did not mind the collateral damage of moving a few meetings at the last minute simply for the relief of a detailed and more informal conversation.“I am tired of Zoom calls for the most part,” Banglani said. “There is a collective relief at being able to do in-person meetings again. Zoom meetings end up being too transactional. In-person meetings are more wide-ranging. We can discuss each other’s portfolios, investment theses and interest areas.”Founders and investors saw their relationship tested in the early days of the pandemic, one that they now seek to strengthen by meeting again. Investors are combating Zoom fatigue by making it clearer than ever how they prefer to communicate.Sequoia India partner GV Ravishankar’s WhatsApp status reads: “WhatsApp chat>Call>Zoom.”Such a clear public preference would have been unheard of, even considered rude, before the pandemic.VC firms have also started having internal meetings in-person, with teams traveling for off-sites and annual get-togethers, according to three people at top firms. These events serve as places to catch up with each other, plan internal strategy, judge younger investors and their performance, and have deeper discussions about future investments, some of which are more conducive to in-person meetings.At some of these internal meetings, firms discuss investments they missed, new sectors to look out for, and propositions that worked or did not work or, in some cases, are too early to tell.“Physical meetings are very important for team bonding. The nature of work of a VC is that you have deep and hard discussions because you are pushing each other's thinking,” said Anand Datta, vice president at Nexus Venture Partners, an early stage investor in Bengaluru.For many investors, traveling marks a return to normalcy – for good and bad. Investors say they have missed even the mundane and often troubling bits of business travel – delayed flights, traffic on the roads, booking a cab and travel fatigue.“It is hard to quantify what more you get from a physical meeting, but you talk more, you go deeper, and there is some unstructured learning,” Datta says.Madhu Yalamarthi, vice president at GGV Capital, agrees. After 18 months in San Francisco, he travelled to Brazil and Mexico in the past week, meeting entrepreneurs and getting perspectives that he had missed all these months – making his trip sound almost spiritual. He enjoyed the routines, hopping between cities, checking flights on the fly and scheduling meetings with buffer time, accounting for peak hour city traffic.“This (venture investing) is a business of trust. Unscheduled, informal, and in-person interactions are great at helping foster them. Intrinsically, that’s how we are wired. So, for example, when we share a car ride for 1.5 hours each way for a field visit with a founder, it gives you insights and trust-building moments you otherwise wouldn’t get as seamlessly through Zoom calls,” he said.Investors anticipate a hybrid model to be the future, where a first meeting or introduction is virtual, followed by physical meetings.“Video calls are great for levelling the geographical playing field. We recently did diligence on a company based in a small town in Gujarat. If it were not for Zoom, we would have found it hard to have an initial interaction with the company,” Banglani said.Before the second wave hit India around April this year, a few investors had started traveling again, but that came to a screeching halt, more so as investors and their close ones were infected by the virus and many lost near and dear ones.Sitting at home, in between doing the dishes, entertaining the children and taking care of parents, the investors made new investments, helped companies through their harshest times, and even raised funds worth billions virtually – something previously unheard of. But the way they did this was hardly sustainable.“When the lockdown started, I was less worried about accessing deals and more about whether I am doing my best in terms of due diligence. On top of that, we had limited time. So you work longer hours, talk to more people via Zoom, and get more work done in less time to get to a similar outcome,” Yalamarthi said.With more than 20 percent of Indians fully vaccinated, investors are traveling more now because no matter how much they try, it is impossible to create a physical environment on video calls, or to have the same closeness, or observe non-verbal cues, which help them judge a person and build a relationship.Yalamarthi developed his own routine during the pandemic: before he finalised an investment, he had a virtual coffee or dinner with the entrepreneur and a 60-90-minute informal session to “chat and exchange thoughts about life, motivations, and other things beyond the business to get to know them better and them me.”But even these meetings had to be scheduled, a calendar invite sent, and finally, it was two people on a laptop screen. It was a decent substitute, but not a replacement for an in-person catchup and the resulting camaraderie.Before the pandemic struck, it was traditional for some VC firms to take a founder out for dinner and drinks before closing an investment in an attempt to bond and know them better. Now, these customs are back.Even so, investors are acutely aware of the possibility of a third wave in India and don’t want to be blindsided again. Many of them have seen relatives in other countries infected by the most recent wave there, and are still staying vigilant, having suffered previously.Datta of Nexus still meets people in person only if he deems it essential and ensures they sit in an open area, not in an enclosed or air-conditioned room, where a virus can potentially spread faster.“I still think everyone should worry about a third wave. We’ve seen evidence of it in the US and the UK. There’s a very good chance of it, so you have to maintain all precautions,” he said.GGV’s Yalamarthi, too, is relatively cautious.“As I’m moving between countries, I’m taking an RT-PCR test and wearing a mask even if the broader public isn’t locally. It is more of an intrinsic thing than a rational thing, given the high vaccination rates and low infection rates. I just want to be doubly sure,” he said.If there is a third wave, investors will jump back to Zoom, whether they like it or not.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/startup/sick-of-zoom-and-vigilant-of-a-third-wave-vcs-get-back-to-in-person-meetings-travel-7595841.html,Funding,"Startup investors, used to taking four flights a week for years, have sat at home for the past 18 months as the pandemic unfolded, watching their portfolio companies collapse and then bounce back with unexpected vigour, aided by an epic funding boom.Now, as Covid-19 abates in India, many of them are back to traveling with full fervour, meeting the founders of the companies they’ve invested in for the first time and finding out the joys and pains of an older world, even as the fear of a possible third wave lingers.Investors have committed billions of dollars sitting in their homes – startup funding crossed $20 billion in 2021.So you work longer hours, talk to more people via Zoom, and get more work done in less time to get to a similar outcome,” Yalamarthi said.With more than 20 percent of Indians fully vaccinated, investors are traveling more now because no matter how much they try, it is impossible to create a physical environment on video calls, or to have the same closeness, or observe non-verbal cues, which help them judge a person and build a relationship.Yalamarthi developed his own routine during the pandemic: before he finalised an investment, he had a virtual coffee or dinner with the entrepreneur and a 60-90-minute informal session to “chat and exchange thoughts about life, motivations, and other things beyond the business to get to know them better and them me.”But even these meetings had to be scheduled, a calendar invite sent, and finally, it was two people on a laptop screen.",['Covid-19'],"['committed billions of dollars', '$20 billion']"
"Crypto investments now 50% of all SE Asia deals discussed at Sequoia Capital, says MD Shailendra Singh",14 October,"Venture capital firm Sequoia Capital is looking at considerably growing its investments in the cryptocurrency space globally. The firm’s Managing Director Shailendra Singh said that 40 to 50 percent of the deal pipeline being discussed internally is regarding crypto investments. In India, Sequoia is invested in the newest and only the second crypto unicorn – CoinSwitch.Singh spoke at merchant platform Pine Labs’ annual event Pine Labs X.0, along with the company’s Chief Executive Officer Amrish Rau.Payment companies like Paytm and PhonePe in India have been rapidly expanding to offer financial services like wealth management, mutual funds, insurance, Buy Now Pay Later (BNPL) etc. Singh sees this as an outcome of the increased trust that payments platforms have among users.“Fintech has very high optionality because when you have payment systems, you have more than usual trust than any other form of business. Merchants, customers and bankers -- all trust you to manage their money,” he said.The trust helps payments platforms to upsell and cross-sell other services to customers, according to Singh. Pine Labs too has Pay Later, loyalty and prepaid gift card products apart from its payments infrastructure.“People underestimate the optionality that fintech offers. Take PayPal; over 20 years after PayPal was sold to eBay, I just read last week that they might be launching stock trading. I think to myself what took them 20 years?” he noted.After the pandemic’s onset last year, customer behaviour changed drastically towards rapid digital adoption. For Sequoia, the digitisation of Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) is a theme to watch out for.“The idea of SMEs adopting digitisation is a transformative trend and has benefitted many companies including Pine Labs.

"Exclusive | Sixth Sense Ventures to close Rs 2,500-crore fund from domestic investors amid epic boom",12 October,"Sixth Sense Ventures, which wanted to raise a Rs 900-crore fund six months ago, is planning to close it down at nearly three times that amount, that too from only domestic investors, reflecting the unprecedented startup funding boom in IndiaSixth Sense, founded by former IDFC executive Nikhil Vora, plans to close the fund—its third—at about Rs 2,500 crore, and is finalising commitments from large institutions, including listed pharma and consumer companies and insurers, sources said. Vora confirmed the development and said the fund will be closed soon.“We would be the largest domestic fund raised in India. I really didn’t expect this kind of response and fundraising environment,” Vora said. Moneycontrol had first reported about the fundraising talks on August 10.Sixth Sense backs early-to-growth-stage consumer companies, its portfolio comprising Bombay Shaving Company, beer-maker Bira, sauce-maker Veeba Foods and Sachin Tendular-backed entertainment arena Smaaash. It is a uniquely structured fund with strategies and incentives vastly different from most other venture firms.From the new fund, it plans to make about 35 investments, with an initial cheque size of Rs 40-50 crore, which can go over Rs 100 crore, including follow-on rounds.Compared to investing Rs 500 crore over three years from its previous fund, Sixth Sense has committed Rs 500 crore in the last three months, Vora said.Unlike traditional venture funds, Sixth Sense invests in offline and online consumer firms, not always technology led, the way VCs prefer. Sixth Sense is also taking a more calibrated approach than typical VCs, for whom a couple of investments will become multi-billion-dollar companies and give the investors nearly all their returns, while some companies will fall by the wayside—shut down or be acquired for a lower valuation.Sixth Sense is betting that most, if not all its companies will scale, and even if they don’t become multi-billion-dollar companies, a portfolio full of companies valued at $400-500 million could still net massive returns for an investor if there are no failures, said people familiar with the fund. The strategy is similar to private equity funds, although Vora insists Sixth Sense is a venture firm, given that it comes early into a company’s journey, and some of these companies may not be profitable.Vora had filed with market regulator Sebi earlier this year to raise Rs 900 crore, with an option to garner up to Rs 1,500 crore, if demand overshot his expectations— the so-called greenshoe option. The fund still overshot his wildest expectations.“Demand for domestic VC funds is crazy. The age-old institutions— listed companies and corporates —really want to tap into the new economy,” said a fund manager, requesting anonymity.“Top VCs— Sequoia and Accel, and PE funds, say Kedaara or ChrysCapital — raise money only from foreign investors. So if a domestic LP (limited partner, who backs funds) wants exposure to the new economy, this is the ideal vehicle,” the person said.Sixth Sense also recently hired Ketki Paranjpe from L Catterton as a partner in its investment team.Startups have raised over $25 billion in a little over nine months of 2021, nearly doubling the previous annual funding record of $13 billion in 2019.Sixth Sense, founded by Vora and his IDFC colleague Japan Vyas, raised its debut fund of Rs 118 crore in 2016, followed by a Rs 515 crore fund in 2018. Vyas left the firm in 2018 to launch his own consumer-focused VC fund, Roots Ventures.In its first fund, Sixth Sense is sitting on returns of 2.5 times the invested capital, while its second fund has 1.9 times the invested capital, as per its website. Its funds are relatively young and could see more portfolio markups — companies raising money at a higher valuation — making its fund outcomes even better, people tracking the space said.Vora recently said in a LinkedIn post that both of Sixth Sense's funds are among India's top-performing funds from 2010-18, citing numbers from financial data platform Preqin.However, whether similar returns can be made from a much larger third fund remains to be seen, more so in India, where 70 percent of funds have not returned money to investors in the scheduled time period of 7-1o years, as per Vora. Vora is betting on the Indian consumer market expanding rapidly and companies growing faster than they were earlier.Another investor— venture debt firm Alteria Capital — recently raised an Rs 1800-crore venture debt fund, also entirely from domestic LPs, resulting from similar unprecedented demand.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/startup/exclusive-sixth-sense-ventures-builds-rs-2500-crore-fund-from-domestic-investors-7570621.html,Funding,"It is a uniquely structured fund with strategies and incentives vastly different from most other venture firms.From the new fund, it plans to make about 35 investments, with an initial cheque size of Rs 40-50 crore, which can go over Rs 100 crore, including follow-on rounds.Compared to investing Rs 500 crore over three years from its previous fund, Sixth Sense has committed Rs 500 crore in the last three months, Vora said.Unlike traditional venture funds, Sixth Sense invests in offline and online consumer firms, not always technology led, the way VCs prefer.So if a domestic LP (limited partner, who backs funds) wants exposure to the new economy, this is the ideal vehicle,” the person said.Sixth Sense also recently hired Ketki Paranjpe from L Catterton as a partner in its investment team.Startups have raised over $25 billion in a little over nine months of 2021, nearly doubling the previous annual funding record of $13 billion in 2019.Sixth Sense, founded by Vora and his IDFC colleague Japan Vyas, raised its debut fund of Rs 118 crore in 2016, followed by a Rs 515 crore fund in 2018.","['Sixth Sense', 'Ketki Paranjpe', 'IDFC', 'Rs']","['multi-billion-dollar', 'multi-billion-dollar', '400', 'over $25 billion', '$13 billion']"

Exclusive: Mensa Brands could be India’s fastest unicorn ,04 October,"Zero to one billion dollars in less than six months- Mensa Brands, started by former McKinsey partner and Myntra CEO Ananth Narayanan is in talks to raise funds at a billion dollar valuation, less than six months after it launched, said three people aware of the matter, requesting anonymity.Mensa is building a house of brands by acquiring online sellers in the apparel, home appliance, personal care and beauty space, similar to US-based breakout startup Thrasio, which in two years was valued at $4 billion and profitable.Mensa is in early stage talks to raise $200 million from investors, including Accel Growth- the US-based fund which cuts larger cheques. Another new investor may join the round in addition to existing investors Accel India, Norwest Venture Partners, Falcon Edge Capital and most recently Tiger Global Management. The round may value Mensa at a billion dollars, making it India’s fastest startup to become a unicorn- surpassing blue collar worker hiring platform Apna, which took a little less than two years to reach the mark.Terms of the deal- which will be worked out in the next two months- could still change, sources said. Mensa declined to comment while Accel did not respond to queries seeking comment.“It is a very aggressive bet by investors based on a rosy outlook. Investors are saying they want to come into good companies no matter what the price,” said one person aware of discussions.Moneycontrol first reported on August 2 that Tiger- also an investor in a direct competitor, GOAT Brand Labs- is in talks to back Mensa. According to regulatory filings, Tiger invested $10 million at a valuation of about $250 million last month- four times higher than its previous valuation. Ecommerce roll-up firms, built solely to acquire other companies, have emerged as one of India’s hottest startup spaces. Over $500 million could be invested in the sector this year- most funding rounds based on acquisition timelines and nothing more. Another rollup firm GlobalBees, co-founded by FirstCry’s Supam Maheshwaris in talks to raise $100 million led by SoftBank, Moneycontrol reported last week.These companies promise capital, hiring expertise, technological chops and marketing savvy to turbocharge the growth of online sellers on Flipkart, Amazon, Nykaa and other platforms.Mensa has inked deals- or Letter of Intents (LoIs) with about 25 sellers to acquire them, one person said. Some of these deals are as big as Rs 150-200 crore. E-commerce rollup firms also raise debt because acquisitions are more expensive with equity. Mensa has raised debt from Alteria and InnoVen Capital, and may raise more.“This valuation is based entirely on promise. Investors are betting that Ananth can out-execute and out-choose others when it comes to picking brands and working with them,” a person said.Narayanan, one of India’s best known startup executives, launched Mensa after selling online pharmacy Medlife to larger rival PharmEasy last year.“I have always been a believer in brands. I think there are three things that are happening in India. The first is e-commerce and sales through online channels, which will continue to grow for the next 10 years at 30 to 35 percent year-on-year. Second, as India becomes more prosperous and content becomes more available, Indians are moving from unbranded to branded in almost every segment,” Narayanan told Moneycontrol in an interview earlier. “Third, I fundamentally believe that the skills it takes to scale a digital brand are something that's relatively new, right? So, with all of these, we felt it was the absolute right time to get into the brand space and see if we can partner with the right founders and scale and grow the brands,” he added.India has seen an unprecedented startup funding boom, as the Covid-19 pandemic has turbocharged digital adoption, brought new users to the internet and attracted cheap capital from the US and other countries, where due to low interest rates, investors are seeking high-return riskier bets in emerging markets.Startups have raised over $20 billion this year, nearly double the previous record, with no signs of the boom abating.

"Alteria Capital closes Rs 1,800 crore second venture debt fund",01 October,"Alteria Capital, which lends to startups, said on September 30 that it has closed its second venture debt fund at Rs 1,800 crore- the largest domestic corpus by a new age fund manager amid an unabated startup funding boom.Along with interest, Alteria also gets a small portion of shares in the companies it lends to, which include social commerce firm Dealshare, cloud kitchen Rebel Foods and online car retailer Spinny among others.Alteria raised the entire fund from domestic investors and via video calls, both unheard of for a large fund until recently. The equity funding boom means that entrepreneurs have often raised more venture debt as well, although in some cases the boom has meant that founders raise only equity, simply because so much of it is available.“It is hard to tell when this frenzy will get tempered. Founders are realising that it is a great time to raise capital and optimising for that, which is understandable,” Vinod Murali, co-founder and managing partner, Alteria told Moneycontrol.“But that also means decision making can be a bit harder and we have to be more careful than ever. However the more mature founders are making sure they will be well capitalised next year, even if momentum shifts,” he added.Founded by Murali and Ajay Hattangdi in 2018, Alteria raised a debut Rs 960 crore fund in 2019. In April this year, it marked a Rs 1,350 crore first close of the second fund. From the second fund, it is also diversifying beyond venture to more structured deals- similar to a bank or NBFC.Alteria expects to invest over $200 million in 2021, with individual investments as high as $20-25 million. In many cases it also doubles on portfolio companies and lends further to them.While it did not disclose names of investors in the fund (limited partners or LPs), some of its earlier backers include IndusInd Bank, Small Industries Development Bank of India (Sidbi), Azim Premji Foundation and Flipkart co-founder Binny Bansal.“Apart from existing LPs, we were enthused to see active participation from first time investors who have never invested in startup ecosystem in any form before, specially Founders who have experienced and understand the importance of debt capital to high growth startups.” said Ankit Agarwal, Partner, Alteria Capital.Another venture debt firm InnoVen Capital India also announced the first close of its debut fund at Rs 740 crore earlier this week, after it operated for years with money from its parent Temasek, which commonly allocated money to India, China and Singapore.

While Meesho started out this way, its share of direct sales has also been going up, pitting it directly against incumbents Flipkart and Amazon.The new funding round comes months after Meesho raised $300 million led by SoftBank Vision Fund 2, valuing it at $2.1 billion. Meesho said since the last round of funding, its order volume grew 2.5 times and it has also added new product categories such as sports and fitness, pet supplies and automotive accessories.""We just have grown very fast and the business has grown very fast.

Walmart-owned Flipkart recently forayed into this category with the launch of its Shopsy app, and SEA-owned Shopee is also making plans to expand in India.""Our focus has always been on bringing small businesses online but there are also a lot of people coming directly and buying from us. We will use both approaches – consumer and entrepreneur marketplace, going forward,"" Aatrey said.While fashion accounts for half of its gross merchandise volume (GMV), followed by beauty and personal care, Meesho is also looking to increase grocery and FMCG offerings by expanding its community group buying business Farmiso (Meesho Grocery), to over 200 cities.""We want to be one platform that serves all possible categories.

India Internet Day 2021: Navigating startup funding bubble,24 September,"Some of India’s top technology investors disagreed over whether India is in the middle of a startup bubble, but they all agreed that these are heady times, a time of massive change and could be the first sign of India’s digital future in the decades to come.With startup funding crossing a record  $20 billion in 2021 and 27 unicorns (billion dollar valued startups) created so this year so far,, investors at TiE Delhi-NCR’s India Internet Day 2021, investors spoke about navigating a bubble, why startup funding is so high and things that founders should look out for. Speakers included Anjani Bansal- founder, Avana Capital; Rahul Khanna- managing partner, Trifecta Capital; Anirudh Singh- managing director, Alpha Wave Incubation and Rajat Agarwal- managing director, Matrix Partners India. The session was moderated by Rajan Anandan, partner at Sequoia India.“There is a lot of liquidity and valuations are higher than ever. But India has a massive talent pool and massive digitisation. I’m not sure this is a bubble,” Bansal said.Investors disagreed over whether India is in the middle of a startup bubble, but they all agreed that these are heady times. “This seems like a bubble, but also a once in a generation takeover of the internet. Hopefully India can become what China was for technology all these years,” Singh said.Trifecta’s Khanna defines valuations in three stages- when it is a headache, migraine and a nosebleed. Despite unprecedented amounts of money for unproven business models, he felt valuations are more towards a migraine right now.“I think we are in a bubble, but it is going to last for sometime,” Agarwal said. He however added that companies are showing great unit economics and that the Indian internet market is clearly deepening, somewhat justifying the frenzy.Bansal said that publicly listed companies have been trading at 75-80 times revenue in India, while the same companies trade at 15-20 times in other countries, but relative to private markets, whether it is a bubble is unclear.While the funding boom and rapid deal-making has surprised many,  this is not an overnight success, it has been 2 decades in the making,” Khanna said.All investors however agreed that the current momentum will not last endlessly, and entrepreneurs should be watchful. They could not decide however, when the momentum would change. It will depend on the US Federal Reserve hiking interest rates, which leads to less money going to other countries seeking returns. That’s when the bubble could burst, Singh said.“Entrepreneurs should raise money now, because it is a great time, but please don’t spend it all, because the music will stop some day,” Anandan said.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/startup/india-internet-day-2021-navigating-startup-funding-bubble-7503611.html,Funding,"Some of India’s top technology investors disagreed over whether India is in the middle of a startup bubble, but they all agreed that these are heady times, a time of massive change and could be the first sign of India’s digital future in the decades to come.With startup funding crossing a record  $20 billion in 2021 and 27 unicorns (billion dollar valued startups) created so this year so far,, investors at TiE Delhi-NCR’s India Internet Day 2021, investors spoke about navigating a bubble, why startup funding is so high and things that founders should look out for.He however added that companies are showing great unit economics and that the Indian internet market is clearly deepening, somewhat justifying the frenzy.Bansal said that publicly listed companies have been trading at 75-80 times revenue in India, while the same companies trade at 15-20 times in other countries, but relative to private markets, whether it is a bubble is unclear.While the funding boom and rapid deal-making has surprised many,  this is not an overnight success, it has been 2 decades in the making,” Khanna said.All investors however agreed that the current momentum will not last endlessly, and entrepreneurs should be watchful.",[],"['$20 billion', 'billion dollar']"
'He is his own ecosystem': Inside Kunal Shah's unique angel investing frenzy,23 September,"It took a minute for Kunal Shah to commit $20,000 to a new startup he had never heard of. At 3:20 pm, an investor sent Shah a short message on WhatsApp, detailing the financing company’s pitch. At 3:21 pm, Shah replied, agreeing to invest the money as part of a half-a-million-dollar funding round, according to the exchange of messages Moneycontrol reviewed.The episode offers a peek into the investment habits of Shah, founder and CEO of fintech firm CRED. Shah, 42, is India’s most active, prolific and arguably powerful angel investor.Shah has more than 200 investments under his belt. He has made double the angel investments than the closest contenders on the list —Snapdeal’s Kunal Bahl and former Google India head Rajan Anandan who have each put money in 103 companies, according to data tracker Tracxn. Other well-known angels such as Livspace’s Ramakant Sharma, Flipkart’s Binny Bansal and Jupiter’s Jitendra Gupta all have between 40 and 70 angel investments.As he aims to disrupt how people pay their credit card bills and manage their money, Shah is also disrupting how entrepreneurs make angel investments.Despite the rush of money, it usually isn’t easy for fledgling startups to raise money. Such exercises are often driven by relationships. A startup founder often has to wait months to even land a meeting with a venture capitalist. What follows is a whole song and dance that has the founders trying to convince investors and investors asking questions about the business.Not so with Shah. Founders who raised money from Shah, and investors who pitch to Shah on founders’ behalf, say almost all of Shah’s angel investing decisions are done on … wait for it, WhatsApp!In one instance, an entrepreneur sent his pitch deck to Shah on WhatsApp, and said he’s raising a million dollars. Shah, who had never spoken to the founder before, committed $50,000 in a few minutes, said a person involved in the transaction.As Shah wants to change people’s relationship with money, his own relationship with money may be changing too.Moneycontrol spoke to over a dozen of Shah’s portfolio companies, his own investors in CRED and before, and his friends in the startup community to understand his angel investing strategy. They spoke on the condition of anonymity, so they could speak candidly.Shah, who previously founded and later sold a payment-wallet company named Freecharge to e-commerce firm Snapdeal, declined to be interviewed for this article. “He does angel investments in a personal capacity to give back to the ecosystem and to support founders. It’s not something he’d talk about,” a spokesperson said.Super AngelEstimates vary on how many investments Shah has made. He told Moneycontrol last month that he does not track his angel investments, but estimated his portfolio at 150-170 companies. Two people close to Shah say it crossed the 200 mark recently.Raviteja Dodda is bemused by one-minute and two-day deals these days. The founder and CEO of MoEngage, a software and analytics firm, says he was lucky to close his seed funding quickly. In 2015, quickly meant two months, even when the company knew its investor Helion Venture Partners for a few years.Angels usually start investing in the sector they know best—fintech in Shah’s case—but his portfolio today encompasses companies from almost every sector- health and fitness, ecommerce, logistics, B2B marketplaces, and mobility, among others. He does however hold stakes in a number of top fintechs such as Razorpay, Rupeek, BharatPe, CoinSwitch Kuber, and Khatabook, among others.Angels usually back a company in its earliest financing rounds, but here too Shah has gone against the grain. He recently invested in Zetwerk, a custom manufacturing platform, in its $150 million Series E round.Shah invests between $10,000 and 50,000. He usually lets the founder decide how much. By now, founders pitch to Shah knowing how much he typically invests.It is not unusual for entrepreneurs to frequently dabble in angel investments. But the sheer volume of Shah’s dealmaking has raised eyebrows among his peers, friends and investors.He has made at least 50 investments this year alone, and 16 in the last two months, according to Tracxn. Some of the investments have not been announced yet.“Kunal does one deal a day. He gets the quality of deal flow that would make the best VCs jealous,” one founder in Shah’s portfolio says, only half in jest.Shah gets his deal flow from fellow repeat entrepreneurs, senior employees at startups, his own investors such as Sequoia Capital and Ribbit Capital, and many VCs who haven’t invested in CRED or his previous firm Freecharge, but are friendly with Shah nevertheless. His investments have become a flywheel, where older portfolio founders refer newer founders to Shah, and each deal Shah does helps him get even more deal flow.But the act of raising money from Kunal Shah, and what it means, has changed over the years, particularly as with over 200 portfolio companies, Shah simply cannot promise what other angel investors promise- spending time with entrepreneurs, mentoring them and serving as a sounding board in a startup’s tumultuous journey.Angel investing isn’t a new fad for Shah though. In early 2015, Shah reached out to Harshil Mathur and Shashank Kumar via Facebook Messenger (the choice of messaging app also tells you how long back it was), wanting to invest in their new payments firm. He got the reference from Snapdeal’s Kunal Bahl, also an angel investor in Razorpay.“He is the most helpful angel investor we have ever come across,” Razorpay co-founder and CEO Mathur told Moneycontrol.Mathur said before each funding round that Razorpay raises (it has raised over $350 million so far), he consults Shah to decide who will invest in the round and what stake they should get, which helps Razorpay negotiate with investors for the right structure. Shah also introduced Razorpay to Sequoia Capital, one of Razorpay’s biggest investors today.Entrepreneurs from 2015-18 have similar tales to tell about Shah, whose connections and network in the startup and investing world are one of the biggest reasons new entrepreneurs want him on their capitalisation table (a company’s list of investors).While most experienced entrepreneurs boast similar connections, two people said that Shah helps more founders with connections than nearly anyone else they know. One even joked that Shah’s networks stretch so wide, if you need to speak to the Chinese Premier, Kunal Shah will put you in touch.But as Shah becomes a more active investor, his relationship with his portfolio founders has changed.One founder of a consumer startup, who raised money from Shah last year, wanted to talk to him recently and get advice. He reached out to one of Shah’s friends, a well-known Bengaluru-based senior founder, to make an introduction.This founder was mystified. “He’s on your cap table. Why are you asking me for an introduction?”Newer entrepreneurs and venture capitalists are slowly realising that raising money from Kunal Shah may not be as big a deal as they think it to be, or want it to be, because in their eyes today, Kunal Shah seems to be investing in every other company.A partner at a venture fund secured an investment for his portfolio company from Shah earlier this year. He was happy, because early stage startups work largely on signaling and promise- and an investment from Shah certainly meant you were promising and signaled you were special in some way. Having reputed angels and investors helps hire talent, quash competition and play a perception game that you are the next big thing.Six months on, the partner has seen Shah invest in over 50 startups this year alone. “I’m not sure whether it is that big a deal anymore. It looks like he’ll fund anyone who reaches out to him. And that makes you wonder, should you raise from him at all?,” the partner said.Like any angel, money from Shah is no guarantee that your business will succeed. His portfolio has a posse of companies that flattered to deceive such as Bharat Bazaar, Cookify, Pianta, and Voonik, among others. With his current style of WhatsApp dealmaking, Shah also does little to no due diligence, counting on whoever has referred the founder to him—generally a venture capitalist leading the round—to perform diligence.Entrepreneurs say raising money from Shah is optimised for speed. He is quick to respond on WhatsApp, even if he is busy. For documentation and other procedural back-and-forth, founders are more in touch with a man named Vasant Shah, who works with Kunal on his angel investments and manages them.Why does Kunal invest?Shah told Moneycontrol last month that he invests to pay it forward. “I don’t track my investments. You can do philanthropy or fund job creators. India needs job creators.”By all accounts, making money from these investments is not his primary purpose. He will certainly though.He is an early investor in at least four unicorns—Unacademy, Razorpay, CoinSwitch Kuber and BigBasket. Many more such as Spinny, Rupeek, and Shiprocket, among others, are poised to get there.Angel investing helps Shah give back to the startup ecosystem which gave him a career, pay it forward, and firmly places him in the upper echelon of Indian technology entrepreneurs. Along with his two startups, his social media following, filled with esoteric yet massy tweets at the same time have garnered him a following and cult-like status that not even the Flipkart’s Bansals, Paytm’s Vijay Shekhar Sharma or Ola’s Bhavish Aggarwal have, despite all of them building larger companies, generating more revenue and employing more people than Shah.“Kunal really wants to do what he can for the ecosystem. If that one random founder can sell his company’s story to investors because Kunal Shah’s name is on his pitch deck, he does not mind that. This is his version of philanthropy,” another person close to Shah says.“Investing in so many founders, giving them money early on builds him tremendous goodwill. That is what he wants. Imagine the goodwill of 200-300 people compounding for you,” this person added.Not always. Shah’s social media following also leads to a lot of trolling. Skeptics make memes about CRED’s lack of a business model and ballooning valuation (some of this was before CRED started lending, its first attempt to make money).He spends more time on Twitter and Instagram than building his company, they allege. While general mocking from unknown people hardly bothers Shah, other entrepreneurs mocking CRED or Shah affects him. His affinity and respect for fellow entrepreneurs, big and small is a big reason for being an active angel investor, so active that even he can’t keep track of his investments anymore.Early this year, an entrepreneur tweeted a spiritual guru’s picture, with the caption that this guru is one of two people who understands CRED’s business model. The founder thought this was a harmless joke.Later that day, the founder was surprised to get a call from Shah, who was disappointed with the tweet, explained to him that lending is CRED’s business model, and told him that “entrepreneurs need to support each other” rather than making fun of each other. The founder then deleted the tweet.Kunal Shah: Angel Investor 2.0Entrepreneurs today realise that an investment from Kunal Shah by no means guarantees any help or support from him. Two founders, who raised from him recently, know this because it still felt beneficial to them.“Today, all these well-known angels are of no use operationally or for mentorship etc. But having them signals that you’re going somewhere, doing something meaningful. People take you seriously when these well known angels are on your cap table. Their personal brand is reflected in my young company,” one of them said.Other angel investors, less wealthier and influential than Kunal Shah, but as invested in India’s startup scene, still want to mentor founders, and want angels who will work closely with them. But today Shah can invest how he wants, where he wants, when he wants and how much he wants simply because of the pomp and glamour that comes with being Kunal Shah, or being even remotely associated with him.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/trends/features/he-is-his-own-ecosystem-inside-kunal-shahs-unique-angel-investing-frenzy-7496121.html,Funding,"Shah, who had never spoken to the founder before, committed $50,000 in a few minutes, said a person involved in the transaction.As Shah wants to change people’s relationship with money, his own relationship with money may be changing too.Moneycontrol spoke to over a dozen of Shah’s portfolio companies, his own investors in CRED and before, and his friends in the startup community to understand his angel investing strategy.His investments have become a flywheel, where older portfolio founders refer newer founders to Shah, and each deal Shah does helps him get even more deal flow.But the act of raising money from Kunal Shah, and what it means, has changed over the years, particularly as with over 200 portfolio companies, Shah simply cannot promise what other angel investors promise- spending time with entrepreneurs, mentoring them and serving as a sounding board in a startup’s tumultuous journey.Angel investing isn’t a new fad for Shah though.","['Shah', 'Shah', 'Shah', 'Kunal Shah']","['20,000', 'a million dollars', '50,000', '$150 million', 'between $10,000', 'over $350 million']"
"Byju's buys US-based coding platform Tynker, its 9th acquisition this year",16 September,"Byju's, India's most valued internet startup on September 16 said it will acquire Tynker, a US-based coding platform for kids. This is the latest in a series of acquisitions by the ed-tech behemoth this year to consolidate its leadership in the K-12 (kindergarten to 12th grade) segment, even as it weighs plan to list on the public markets in the US.Moneycontrol reported the Byju's-Tynker deal on September 12, 2021.Byju's breathtaking pace of fund-raising and acquisitions has earned it the moniker of 'Buyju's' in the internet ecosystem.Tynker is in fact its 9th acquisition this year, coming on the heels of buys such as Aakash, Great Learning, Epic, Scholr and Gradeup as Byju's buttresses its product portfolio to go after varied segments such as K12, test prep, upskilling and learning.It has spent over $2 billion to buy nine companies this year. It is also reportedly in talks with investors to raise $1.5 billion, at a valuation of over $21 billion, after which it could look at the listing in the US. It is currently valued at $16.5 billion, making it the most valued unicorn in India. ​However, Byju's Chief Strategy Officer Anita Kishore, who has been playing a pivotal role in leading their acquisition strategy says they don't keep count.""We don't keep track of numbers and don't work with a target number. Each of these acquisitions has been very specific. Tynker is a product that we have been looking at for a while and we first met them 2-3 years ago.,"" Kishore told Moneycontrol in an interview.Interestingly, the Tynker acquisition will be the second in the coding space after Whitehat Junior, which Byju's bought for $300 million in August 2020. While Byju's and Tynker did not disclose the size of the deal, Moneycontrol learns that it could be in the range of $100 million. This is also the third-based US-based company that Byju's is buying, after educational gaming startup Osmo and online reading platform Epic.Also Read: Byju's FY20 profit grows over two-folds to Rs 50.76 croreTynker was founded by Krishna Vedati, Srinivas Mandyam and Kelvin Chong in 2012 in Mountain View, California. It teaches children aged between 5-18 how to develop coding skills. Its coding platform has been used by over 60 million kids and 100,000 schools in 150 countries.While coding startups like Whitehat Junior have come under fire in the past for using misleading ads and for the quality of its teachers, Tynker on the face of it has a different approach when it comes to imparting coding skills.""We wanted to give our children a life skill or a craft they can use to become anything they want to become. We focussed on self-learning and an interest-driven approach, trying to make it fun and interesting,"" Krishna Vedati said.""Even if you have to train a dragon, what they think they do is playing but they are actually learning.""His co-founder Srinivas Mandyam added that 1 in 3 schools in the US already use Tynker, giving Byju's a huge foothold in North America and it hopes its India reach will go up after it recently released an Android version.Also Read: Inside Byju’s deal machine—the strategy, approach and learning""If you look at pre-readers even dragging code like Scratch is hard if you don't have motor skills. So we innovated with a click and pop. Kids start with icon coding block, then block coding and then they start seeing languages in blocks and then start coding,"" Mandyam said.Kishore also ruled out any conflicts between Tynker and Whitehat Junior and said the two offerings are very complementary.""The Whitehat Junior product is very strong, it has scaled and its NPS (net promoter score) is the highest you will see across products. They made some missteps in marketing, which they corrected,"" she said, adding that while Tynker would offer an asynchronous way of learning, Whitehat was a more synchronous one.According to data sourced from Pitchbook, Tynker has over 60 employees and raised $10.35 million in Series A funding led by Krishna Bharat, Cervin Ventures, Prime Partners and Felicis Ventures on May 31, 2016, putting the pre-money valuation at $20.7 million and over $31 million post-money. 13 other investors also participated in the round.While Vedati did not share details of the revenue run rate or funding rounds, he said the startup has been profitable for the last 5 years and confirmed that it has between 60-100 employees. Vedati, Mandyam and Chong will continue in their roles post-acquisition.""We have a huge global brand in coding and we spent 9 years scaling. We now want to take it to the next level.

"SBICAP Ventures completes 1,100 stuck homes in five stressed projects",04 September,"Within about a year and a few months since it was tasked with funding stressed projects across the country, SBICAP Ventures, the manager for the government's Rs 25,000 crore stressed-asset fund, has so far completed 1,100 stuck houses in five projects across the country and is hopeful that if there are no further COVID-related delays, 10,000 homes will be completed by the end of the financial year.“We have already completed 1100 homes in five projects across the country. We are hopeful that with no COVID-19 related delays we will be able to complete 10,000 homes by the end of this financial year. With the current approvals in place we are in a position to have a run rate of 10,000 homes completed every year for the next three to four years,” Irfan A Kazi, Chief Investment Officer at SBICAP Ventures Ltd, said in a CII-Anarock webinar on September 3.The session was being moderated by Anarock Chairman Anuj Puri.The Fund has so far accorded final approval to as many as 87 real estate projects that will see the completion of 53,000 homes.“We have given clearance to 87 projects which will see the completion of 83,000 homes. We have a prelim clearance for 142 projects which will see the completion of another 78,000 homes. On the basis of final approvals, we are scheduled to complete 53,000 homes,” he said.Asked if the entire Rs 25,000 crore has been spent, he said that the amount may take another six to seven years to exhaust.“Our spending rate is linked to the pace of construction. It is not a question of Rs 25,000 crore. The government has made it clear that money is no constraint,” he added.“We are a social impact fund.  We are not looking at 20% returns but 12% returns. The projects that we invest in may not be able to get funding even at double that rate. That is how SWAMIH is different but what is it that we have done differently. This is the first fund that is focused on construction only,” he said.He said that the Fund has so far given final approval to projects in 36 cities across the country. That includes the eight-tier 1 cities and 28 tier 2 cities.“We have a two-stage approval process – we first give a prelim approval and we get a prelim approval from our investment committee. We then do an intensive external due diligence for which we appoint four to five external agencies to do due diligence with regard to different aspects of a project – forensic, title, and then we give final approval,” he added.Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on May 13 handed over possession to 640 homebuyers of the first stalled project completed with funding by SWAMIH Fund managed by SBICap Ventures Ltd and said that the Fund will benefit 1.16 lakh buyers whose projects had been stalled due to last-mile funding issues.Mumbai-based Rivali Park Wintergreens is the first investment by the Fund and is also the first project to be completed.

"In swift turn of events, founders now hold the aces against investors at startups",01 September,"In mid-2020, when the coronavirus was raining blows on the economy, venture capitalists were in the driver’s seat at startups. With their companies struggling, these investors were nudging founders to launch layoffs, recast the business and commence emergency financing rounds. In the few new investments they made, they sought stringent terms to protect themselves. In many cases, founders had no choice but comply—companies were in distress and needed the money, strings attached or not.What a difference a year makes.As startups raise unprecedented amounts of money at dizzying valuations, many founders are now spoilt for choice. That has given them unprecedented bargaining power.Sample this. A few months ago, the founder of an early stage startup, along with a zealous lawyer from a top law firm, tried to pull a fast one. While negotiating terms during their fundraise, the founder had to negotiate reverse vesting—that his shares will go back to the company if he leaves the company. This clause is standard and meant to align incentives. You don't want a founder to leave the company, and then get rich from those shares while someone else actually builds the company.The founder and lawyer took a different view though. First, they negotiated for free shares—an equity kicker—that the founder should get after raising money- so that his stake falls less . Then they said the reverse vesting should apply only to these free shares. The founder wanted to keep all his shares even if he leaves the company. If he leaves the company, he should forfeit only those free shares, they argued.Change in power Suffice to say founders have unseated investors from the driver’s seat. They make sure they cannot be sidelined even if their shareholding falls to miniscule levels. They are looking to seize control over key matters and protect themselves even if the company goes through a rough patch.Today promoters of Series A and Series B funded companies are asking for terms which founders of billion dollar companies generally ask for. For early- stage founders in particular, legal terms used to be somewhat of a formality a few years ago, and they would engage small law firms or friends to help them, for a cursory read-through. Top law firms are a standard feature at well-funded seed and Series A startups, helping them maintain their stakes and not give away any unnecessary rights or terms.Promoters see food delivery firm Zomato’s blockbuster IPO as a warning sign. Despite a successful listing, founder and CEO Deepinder Goyal made far less money than many investors because he owned only 5% of the company. That was because Goyal has been diluting stake over the years, especially early on when InfoEdge and Sequoia owned over half the company (more on this later).“Founders are increasingly becoming more deal savvy, willing to engage deeply in the negotiation process and go the length to ensure that their rights are adequately protected,” says Nivedita Nivargi, a partner at law firm Samvad Partners.Veto termsA shining example of the change in power equations is Shailaz Nag, founder of on-demand commerce startup DotPe. Nag, a former CEO of PayU, has some unusually strong terms baked into legal agreements to run his company.According to DotPe’s Articles of Association, which describe the rights of each shareholder, Nag and his co-founders ('promoters’) have a veto on several matters, including approving annual budget, hiring and firing of key people, offering of new products, appointments of auditors and any change in the company’s ESOP pool. The company or its investors cannot take decisions on any of these matters unless promoters approve it, indicate the documents reviewed by Moneycontrol.The terms are curious because as a Series-A funded startup, Nag and his co-founders still own over 35% of the company, more than what any single investor holds. Their shareholding already entitles them to the rights they have asked for, without having an explicit veto right.Yet, the founders have injected these rights to secure their power further, so that even if their shareholding reduces in the future, their control over the company doesn’t. These veto rights, under a section called Promoter Reserved Matters, are generally a common feature in large startups, such as unicorns.“These terms are very aggressive for today. But Shailaz has kept it to set a precedent for the future. If he introduces these veto matters three years later, a new investor may say that he never had these terms before, so why have them now? He wants it to become a habit so in the future too, investors know who is running the company,” said a person close to the company. Nag declined to comment.Rewriting everything Founders, armed with top lawyers, are also undoing provisions from earlier rounds that gave their investors more power. At one unicorn recently, a top law firm rewrote the entire shareholder agreement to make sure that no decision can be made without a 75% majority (it is 51% in most cases). In this company the founders hold over a third of the company, so effectively no decision can be passed without their approval.“Today, founders seem to have more leverage given market conditions which enables them to negotiate better protections for themselves. They are better advised today so that they can set up the deal terms in earlier rounds to protect them even as the company grows and raises more money. Today they're making sure they remain relevant based on rights negotiated upfront,” said Amit Khansaheb, who has advised companies including Byju’s, BookMyShow and Eruditus and is a partner at law firm Shardul Amarchand Mangaldas.Terms that were standard even two years ago have become taboo today. For instance, early stage founders are not giving liquidation preference to any investor- earlier investors would strongly argue that if the company shuts down, they either get back 1.5-2 times of what they invested, or get paid their share before other investors. Now, investors instead have a ‘pari pasu’ right- which means every investor has equal priority of repayment if the company shuts down. Earlier 1.5x preference was a standard feature in deal terms from top venture funds.Similarly, if a company is not able to give an investor an exit in a certain period of time, investors generally have the right to force a sale, often to a competitor.“Founders have been able to negotiate stronger positions for themselves - including preventing sales by investors to competitors in all but the most dire of circumstances, where all exit options have failed,” said Vaibhav Kakkar, partner at Saraf and Partners, who has advised Tencent on its investments in Swiggy and Dream11 and Steadview Capital- an investor in Dream11 and BharatPe, among others.When founders and investors disagree over key matters and come to a head, new clauses inserted in agreements say that the founder can force a share sale and give the investor an exit at a certain valuation, rather than even considering removing the founder. “Differential voting rights has been key to this change - with promoters seeking to enforce control over companies even while holding minority stakes. These protections ensure that whether companies sink or swim, the founders can continue to be lead companies,” he added.Differential voting rights have been the cornerstone of founders consolidating power at Silicon Valley giants like Alphabet (Google), Facebook, Airbnb and Snap, where founders hold minuscule shares compared to investors, but have outsized voting rights- upto 100 votes a share, compared to investors who may have one vote per share.The Ola exampleCloser home, in 2018, Ola’s Bhavish Aggarwal used voting rights and other terms to change Ola’s internal laws and prevent SoftBank from increasing its stake in the ride-hailing firm- the first case of a well-known founder antagonising its largest investor. Around the same time when Flipkart founders Sachin and Binny Bansal were both sidelined and former Tiger Global executive Kalyan Krishnamurthy became the ecommerce company’s CEO, other entrepreneurs too began shoring up their rights to prevent such an investor-led takeover.VCs often find some of these terms unpalatable, but are having to digest them for fear of not being able to invest in the next multi-billion dollar startup.“For a seed cheque, if a founder is gaming the situation, where we are one of many options, that is a disastrous start to a relationship,” said Karthik Reddy, managing partner at Blume Ventures.In many cases where founders are inserting downside protection to parachute themselves out if something goes wrong, it flies against the principle of building for the long term, something founders and investors encourage.To be sure though, these legal negotiations depend heavily on intangible factors including the founder’s charm and bargaining power, how hot the company or sector is, and how many investors are jostling to back a single company. In companies that miss these factors, deal terms are still standard, and if the company is struggling to raise money or its internal investors aren’t bullish on its fortunes, terms can still swing towards investors.Founders cashing outFounders are also cashing out their own stakes in companies more early on, as early as Series B rounds. Earlier in most cases this used to be a loud alarm bell for investors, who feel that the founder’s incentive might be reduced if he sells a portion of his stake.In over a dozen companies in the past year, including Wakefit, Oziva, Eruditus and others, founders have sold a part of their stake to existing or new investors. In most cases founders sell about 2-5% of their stake- say if you own 30% you sell 1.5-3%- worth many million dollars. Founders, many of whom have worked for over 5 years at below market level salaries, sell these stakes to buy a house, finance their children’s education, help a family member with a loan or simply to upgrade their standard of living.“Earlier it used to be a flat no from most investors. Today if you have a valid reason and you still own enough, it is okay to sell some shares. Founders deserve some liquidity after slumming it out for years, when their peers in the corporate world have struck gold. Everyone starts benchmarking to their peers and college mates,” said a founder who recently sold shares in a Series B round, requesting anonymity.Founders are also inking agreements that let them sell upto 10% of their stake to a buyer at any point, without needing specific investor approval, a previously rare move that’s becoming mainstream.Secondary share sales, in which early investors and sometimes founders sell a part of their stake to new investors has become not only mainstream, but also key to making big deals work. Sometimes these secondaries happen at a far lower valuation than primary shares, a model pioneered by online learning firm Byju’s and co-opted by others“Secondaries are sometimes happening at a fraction of the primary. That’s what makes the deal work because the secondary sellers (founders, employees, early investors) get cash and the incoming investor gets a lower valuation,” a top lawyer said, requesting anonymity.Indian entrepreneurs have raised record sums from investors this year- over $20 billion so far, and yet, are diluting their stakes less than ever before. Founders are able to command double and triple their previous valuations every few months, but are also inserting legal terms that protect that shareholding.Founders of mature hot startups, where the promoters may own less than 20% of the company, are increasingly resorting to ‘no dilution rounds’, where they are rewarded a few percentage points of their stake back from their investors, in lieu of raising funds at a higher valuation. These management stock options (MSOPS) help align incentives, so the founder still stands to make his wealth from the company’s stock, and holds enough of it.For example when Goldman Sachs invested in beauty and makeup brand Purplle in 2019, it in fact recommended that the founders should increase their shareholding, to incentivise them further. So while Goldman invested over $30 million, founders Manish Taneja and Rahul Dash got about 10% shares back from investors, sources said. Purplle did not respond to queries seeking comment.Founders are also clinging on to their shares hoping to make a killing when their startups go public- something that’s happening for the first time in India’s 15-year-old tech ecosystem.“All the founders saw Zomato’s spectacular IPO and wealth creation, but also noted that (founder and CEO) Deepinder (Goyal) owned only 5% of the company. How can you work so hard for so many years, finally make the company big and wind up with only 5%? They don’t want that to happen to them,” a founder said, requesting anonymity.Founders are using MSOPs, no-dilution rounds, and top lawyers from early on to protect their stake and rights. A culture of quickly rising valuations is also letting entrepreneurs dilute less of their stake than they otherwise would. But investors do sometimes worry about the long-term repercussions of tight legal terms haggled down to the last word.The paradoxA lot of this haggling is inherently for clauses that won’t even be used in most scenarios- if the company shuts down, if it is sold for a pittance, if promoters and investors fight- all parties hope to avoid these scenarios. But when entrepreneurs negotiate hard to protect their downside, investors worry about perverse incentives.In some cases, companies are also changing exit terms committed to an investor. Earlier, most companies, including unicorns, have firm exit timelines negotiated by investors, failing which investors can sell their stake however they see fit, whether or not the founder approves. Today, even as more startups are going public, promoters are negotiating for easier exit clauses, where they are held less accountable legally if the exit does not happen on time.While exit clauses still exist, the wordings have become more easy-going- based on more best efforts than a hard-wired obligation, giving promoters more leeway, an analysis of five recent company documents by Moneycontrol showed.“One problem in the current environment is that founders shift to short term behavior. And this problem becomes acute when there's a seasonal trend, like the current funding boom. Founders shouldn’t be optimizing for downside protection, they should be worried about what protects them and the company in a winning scenario, one in which no one looks at the documents,” Blume’s Reddy says.Promoters are tightening the screws during an epic boom, but the effects of these terms could be felt only once the current bubble bursts, when some of these onerous terms may actually be exercised.For instance co-working firm WeWork’s mercurial founder and CEO Adam Neumann sold significant portions of his stock, exercised outsized voting rights and had myriad unusual clauses, something investors looked past because of the company’s searing growth.But when WeWork’s IPO plans blew up and it lost $40 billion in value in days, these same clauses were seen as a lapse in corporate governance. These clauses also meant that WeWork had to pay Neumann a billion dollars to oust him out of the company.How these myriad legal terms will be exercised, and the precedent it sets for other entrepreneurs will determine how startups in India work in the future. If and when the funding tide turns, it could make for many tough boardroom conversations.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/trends/legal-trends/in-swift-turn-of-events-founders-now-hold-the-aces-against-investors-at-startups-7408491.html,Funding,"Earlier 1.5x preference was a standard feature in deal terms from top venture funds.Similarly, if a company is not able to give an investor an exit in a certain period of time, investors generally have the right to force a sale, often to a competitor.“Founders have been able to negotiate stronger positions for themselves - including preventing sales by investors to competitors in all but the most dire of circumstances, where all exit options have failed,” said Vaibhav Kakkar, partner at Saraf and Partners, who has advised Tencent on its investments in Swiggy and Dream11 and Steadview Capital- an investor in Dream11 and BharatPe, among others.When founders and investors disagree over key matters and come to a head, new clauses inserted in agreements say that the founder can force a share sale and give the investor an exit at a certain valuation, rather than even considering removing the founder.Around the same time when Flipkart founders Sachin and Binny Bansal were both sidelined and former Tiger Global executive Kalyan Krishnamurthy became the ecommerce company’s CEO, other entrepreneurs too began shoring up their rights to prevent such an investor-led takeover.VCs often find some of these terms unpalatable, but are having to digest them for fear of not being able to invest in the next multi-billion dollar startup.“For a seed cheque, if a founder is gaming the situation, where we are one of many options, that is a disastrous start to a relationship,” said Karthik Reddy, managing partner at Blume Ventures.In many cases where founders are inserting downside protection to parachute themselves out if something goes wrong, it flies against the principle of building for the long term, something founders and investors encourage.To be sure though, these legal negotiations depend heavily on intangible factors including the founder’s charm and bargaining power, how hot the company or sector is, and how many investors are jostling to back a single company.","['Saraf and Partners', 'Tencent', 'Swiggy', 'Steadview', 'BharatPe', 'Blume Ventures']","['billion dollar', 'multi-billion dollar', 'many million dollars', 'over $20 billion', 'over $30 million', '$40 billion']"
"PayU, Alpha Wave Incubation lead $12 million investment round in Indiagold",27 August,"Indiagold, a platform that provides gold loans, digital gold and other services on August 27 said that it has raised $12 million in its Series A round of funding. The round was led by financial services fintech PayU and Falcon Edge Capital-managed Alpha Wave Incubation (AWI). This mark’s PayU’s first investment in the online gold space.The round also saw participation from Better Tomorrow Ventures, 3one4 Capital, Zerodha-backed Rainmatter Capital, and existing investor, Leo Capital.Indiagold was founded in 2020 by Deepak Abbot and Nitin Misra, both of whom worked with Paytm as Senior Vice Presidents until 2019. The company offers gold-backed loans, gold savings, and gold locker services to over a million customers.The co-founders said, “India offers a large $650 billion addressable gold loan market which is highly fragmented and currently dominated by the informal segment. Even the formal segment hasn’t adopted digital practices at scale. Indiagold’s suite of financial products bridges this critical need gap by digitally transforming lending against gold.”The gold financing business in India is predominantly offline, with the informal segment accounting for 70 percent of gold loans. These loans address the liquidity needs of Indians without access to unsecured credit, which is availed by less than 10 percent of the total working population.The company said that it offers fast, safe and convenient solutions to monetize household gold to meet specific credit needs, and is emerging as an alternative to India’s unorganized gold loan market.“We are proud to have the backing of industry-leading growth investors and take it as a reaffirmation of the inherent strength of our value proposition. With the support of our existing and new investors, we are moving aggressively towards our larger vision of establishing gold holdings as an alternate credit score, and creating a gold back credit platform for lenders to provide instant credit against gold,” Misra and Abbot added.On the investment, Vijay Agicha, Global Head of Strategy and Growth at PayU said, “We are very impressed with Deepak and Nitin's proven record of developing financial products at scale and have faith in their ability to build a profitable business.  We believe that Indiagold has the unique opportunity to expand the addressable market on the back of its product offerings and scale the business up significantly.”“Gold, found in almost every household in India, is the key to provide affordable credit to every Indian.

NBCC receives around Rs 100 crore from SBICap for six stalled Amrapali projects: Sources,26 August,"SBICAP Ventures, the manager for the government's Rs 25,000-crore stressed-asset fund, has transferred the first tranche of disbursement worth around Rs 100 crore for the six projects by the erstwhile Amrapali Group located in Noida and Greater Noida, sources said.“We have received around Rs 100 crore as part of the first tranche so far. With this construction work on the six projects will be expedited,” NBCC sources said.There was no confirmation on the amount from SBICap.“The disbursement has started. We will disburse as per construction and according to the pace of construction. We have committed Rs 650 crore and we will disburse as required and as construction expenditure is incurred in the project,” Irfan A Kazi, Chief Investment Officer of the SWAMIH Investment Fund told Moneycontrol.SBICap had on August 4 signed an MoU with the court receiver, appointed by the Supreme Court to monitor stuck Amrapali projects, for funding Rs 650 crore for six projects in Noida and Greater Noida.At the Amrapali hearing in Supreme Court on August 13, the court receiver informed the bench that SWAMIH Fund had transferred Rs 10 crore as token amount and that another chunk is expected within a fortnight.The bench had said that “all banking formalities have been completed and the first token release has taken place and the amount transferred to NBCC.”He had also informed the court that UCO Bank, Bank of Baroda, and Bank of India have agreed to form a consortium to provide financial assistance to stuck Amrapali projects post the meeting held with 10 banks and their counsels on August 9.NBCC sources said that formalities are currently on with banks.The next court hearing is expected to take place on August 31.The SC on October 13, 2020, had permitted the court receiver to incorporate a special purpose vehicle (SPV) to enable flow of funds from SBICap for completion of unfinished projects. SBICap has agreed to fund Rs 650 crore for around 7,000 stuck units.It is for this reason that the company Amrapali Stalled Projects Investments Reconstruction Establishment (ASPIRE) has been floated. It consists of a court receiver, a forensic auditor and a chartered accountant. It is a not-for-profit company under Section 8 of Companies Act, 2013.""ASPIRE has so far received around Rs 100 crore from SBICap and the amount has been transferred to NBCC,"" NBCC sources said.The projects receiving the funds include Silicon City-1, Silicon City-2, Crystal Homes, Centurian Park- Low Rise, O2 Valley and Tropical Garden where 6,947 units are stalled of which 6,132 units are sold but homebuyers are awaiting delivery.These projects were launched almost 10 years ago between 2011 and 2013 and have been delayed for more than 4-5 years from their promised delivery timeline. The execution works on the said projects were hampered due to the slow inflow of funds and disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.However, funding from SBICAP Ventures Ltd, NBCC shall expedite the progress of the works and will aim to complete the projects within the scheduled time, NBCC had said in a statement.The Court receiver will be assisted by NBCC, which took the construction contracts for these projects after a Supreme Court order and is involved in the completion of about 22 Amrapali housing projects, which were stalled amid a fund crunch due to financial mismanagement at the erstwhile Amrapali Group.The Supreme Court on August 2 had asked banks to relax the funding criteria for stalled Amrapali projects that include submission of collateral security and corporate guarantees, saying that lending to the projects be treated as a special case since it was being monitored under the supervision of the apex court.The court had in 2019 asked the government’s construction arm to finish and deliver 38,159 flats by 2023 after several homebuyers sought its intervention, complaining about years of delay in handing over their homes.The total cost of completing all stuck projects by Amrapali Group is approximately Rs 8,500 crore. NBCC is executing these projects as PMC and would get 8 percent as fees. It is not using its funds, which are being facilitated by a receiver appointed by the Supreme Court.On July 23, 2019, the top court cancelled the registration of the Amrapali Group under the Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016, and ousted it from its prime properties in NCR by nixing land leases for breaching buyers’ trust.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/real-estate/nbcc-receives-around-rs-100-crore-from-sbicap-for-six-stalled-amrapali-projects-sources-7394871.html,Funding,"We have committed Rs 650 crore and we will disburse as required and as construction expenditure is incurred in the project,” Irfan A Kazi, Chief Investment Officer of the SWAMIH Investment Fund told Moneycontrol.SBICap had on August 4 signed an MoU with the court receiver, appointed by the Supreme Court to monitor stuck Amrapali projects, for funding Rs 650 crore for six projects in Noida and Greater Noida.At the Amrapali hearing in Supreme Court on August 13, the court receiver informed the bench that SWAMIH Fund had transferred Rs 10 crore as token amount and that another chunk is expected within a fortnight.The bench had said that “all banking formalities have been completed and the first token release has taken place and the amount transferred to NBCC.”He had also informed the court that UCO Bank, Bank of Baroda, and Bank of India have agreed to form a consortium to provide financial assistance to stuck Amrapali projects post the meeting held with 10 banks and their counsels on August 9.NBCC sources said that formalities are currently on with banks.The next court hearing is expected to take place on August 31.The SC on October 13, 2020, had permitted the court receiver to incorporate a special purpose vehicle (SPV) to enable flow of funds from SBICap for completion of unfinished projects.The execution works on the said projects were hampered due to the slow inflow of funds and disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.However, funding from SBICAP Ventures Ltd, NBCC shall expedite the progress of the works and will aim to complete the projects within the scheduled time, NBCC had said in a statement.The Court receiver will be assisted by NBCC, which took the construction contracts for these projects after a Supreme Court order and is involved in the completion of about 22 Amrapali housing projects, which were stalled amid a fund crunch due to financial mismanagement at the erstwhile Amrapali Group.The Supreme Court on August 2 had asked banks to relax the funding criteria for stalled Amrapali projects that include submission of collateral security and corporate guarantees, saying that lending to the projects be treated as a special case since it was being monitored under the supervision of the apex court.The court had in 2019 asked the government’s construction arm to finish and deliver 38,159 flats by 2023 after several homebuyers sought its intervention, complaining about years of delay in handing over their homes.The total cost of completing all stuck projects by Amrapali Group is approximately Rs 8,500 crore.","['the SWAMIH Investment Fund', 'Moneycontrol', 'the Supreme Court', 'Supreme Court', 'SWAMIH Fund', 'UCO Bank', 'Bank of Baroda', 'Bank of India', 'SC', 'SPV', 'COVID-19', 'SBICAP Ventures Ltd', 'NBCC', 'NBCC', 'Court', 'NBCC', 'Supreme Court', 'Amrapali Group', 'The Supreme Court', 'Amrapali Group']",[]
Exclusive: Byju's in talks to raise $500 million via Term Loan B,25 August,"India’s most valued startup Byju’s is in talks to raise $500 million in a debt round through the TLB or Term Loan B route from global investors as it gears up for an initial public offering (IPO), as per a source.The deal is at an early stage and the company has started working with Morgan Stanley for the same.“It is at a term sheet stage,” said the source quoted above.TLB refers to a tranche of senior secured syndicated credit facility from global institutional investors. OYO was the first company to have raised this debt in India. Moneycontrol reported about it on July 16.Conventionally, TLB proceeds are used either to refinance the existing debts by a company or to make overseas acquisitions with an aim to enhance their offerings.In the case of OYO, $660 million was raised to retire their existing debts and pump up its operations and product technology as it explores the market for a potential IPO.“A TLB makes the balance sheet look healthier and is also seen as a prep for accessing the public market,” said an industry expert, requesting anonymity.Byju’s and Morgan Stanley did not respond to media queries.However, in an interaction with Moneycontrol last month, Byju Raveendran, founder and chief executive officer of Byju’s said that the company was considering a 12-18 months timeline for an IPO.Byju’s, which has spent over $2 billion in acquisitions in the last six months, also has plans for a couple of more acquisitions to drive international expansion.It last announced the acquisition of upskilling platform Great Learning for $600 million. Earlier this year, the company acquired US-based reading platform Epic, educational games maker Osmo, coding startup WhiteHat Jr and offline test preparation firm Aakash Educational Services Limited. Aakash alone was bought for a whopping $1 billion.Valued at $16.5 billion, the company last announced a fundraise of $350 million from UBS, Blackstone, ADQ, Phoenix Rising & Zoom founder Eric Yuan in June.In the last 18 months, it raised over $1.5 billion which is much more than the total funding raised by the company earlier. This euphoria is broadly driven by the growth of online education which got turbocharged by COVID-19 in India.According to data from CB Insights, Byju's is now the 11th most valuable startup in the world. Its revenue doubled in the pandemic year as more students relied on online classes and stood at Rs 5,600 crore for the year ended March 2021.Earlier this month, distant rivals Unacademy and upGrad also raised funding. While Unacademy raised $440 million led by sovereign wealth fund Temasek, valuing it at $ 3.4 billion -- a ten-fold jump in 18 months, upGrad entered the much-coveted unicorn club with a fundraise of $185 million from Temasek, IFC, and IIFL at a valuation of $1.2 billion.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/startup/exclusive-byjus-in-talks-to-raise-500-million-via-term-loan-b-7382681.html,Funding,"India’s most valued startup Byju’s is in talks to raise $500 million in a debt round through the TLB or Term Loan B route from global investors as it gears up for an initial public offering (IPO), as per a source.The deal is at an early stage and the company has started working with Morgan Stanley for the same.“It is at a term sheet stage,” said the source quoted above.TLB refers to a tranche of senior secured syndicated credit facility from global institutional investors.Moneycontrol reported about it on July 16.Conventionally, TLB proceeds are used either to refinance the existing debts by a company or to make overseas acquisitions with an aim to enhance their offerings.In the case of OYO, $660 million was raised to retire their existing debts and pump up its operations and product technology as it explores the market for a potential IPO.“A TLB makes the balance sheet look healthier and is also seen as a prep for accessing the public market,” said an industry expert, requesting anonymity.Byju’s and Morgan Stanley did not respond to media queries.However, in an interaction with Moneycontrol last month, Byju Raveendran, founder and chief executive officer of Byju’s said that the company was considering a 12-18 months timeline for an IPO.Byju’s, which has spent over $2 billion in acquisitions in the last six months, also has plans for a couple of more acquisitions to drive international expansion.It last announced the acquisition of upskilling platform Great Learning for $600 million.","['TLB', 'IPO', 'Morgan Stanley', 'TLB', 'Moneycontrol', 'TLB', 'OYO', 'IPO.“A TLB', 'Byju’s', 'Morgan Stanley', 'Moneycontrol', 'Byju’s']","['$500 million', '$660 million', 'over $2 billion', '$600 million', '$1 billion', '$16.5 billion', '$350 million', 'over $1.5 billion', '$440 million', '$ 3.4 billion', '$185 million', '$1.2 billion']"

"Zetwerk turns unicorn with $150 million led by D1 Capital, valued at $1.3 billion",23 August,"Zetwerk, which helps businesses convert designs for manufacturing tools into physical products, on August 23 said it has raised $150 million led by D1 Capital Partners, valuing it at $1.33 billion, continuing the dealmaking frenzy for startups in general and B2B marketplaces in particular.The Series E round makes Zetwerk India’s 25th unicorn of 2021- private firms valued at over a billion dollars- in a record-breaking year. Along with new investors Avenir and IIFL, existing backers Greenoaks Capital, Lightspeed Venture Partners, Sequoia Capital and Accel also invested. Oyo’s Ritesh Agarwal and Cred’s Kunal Shah invested as well.Founded in 2018 by Amrit Acharya,  Srinath Ramakkrushnan, Rahul Sharma and Vishal Chaudhary, Zetwerk- which means ‘strong foundation’ in Dutch, provides manufacturing services such as fabrication, machining, casting and forging from small and medium companies and connects them to mid-to-large OEMs (original equipment manufacturers) and engineering, procurement and construction firms- earlier in India and South-East Asia and now in North America as well.For customers, Zetwerk says its products are manufactured faster, at competitive prices and with quality, while for manufacturing partners, it drives higher capacity utilization of manufacturing capacities and offers services including logistics, raw material procurement and working capital access.Zetwerk said its revenue nearly tripled from Rs 360 to Rs 949 crore for FY21. With a strong order book at Rs 5,000 crore currently, the company aims to quadruple revenue by FY22. About 70-80% of these orders will fructify into revenue in the short term. Zetwerk is also profitable on an EBITDA basis (Earnings Before Interest Taxes Depreciation Amortisation), a metric for operating profits.“Supply chains are getting reconstructed and the desire to explore Indian markets has never been higher. The cost of manufacturing is reaching parity with other countries,” CEO Acharya told Moneycontrol.It has over 100 clients in North America, ranging from small enterprises to large conglomerates. It makes nail clippers for one company for instance- seen as a niche market but used widely at the same time.Zetwerk has benefitted from global supply chains moving to emerging markets like India, tariff wars between the US and China and a broader anti-China stance. A change in political winds could pose a risk to Zetwerk, but it has 5-10 manufacturing partners so that it can combat this possible risk.Zetwerk is often clubbed by investors along with other B2B marketplaces such as Infra.Market, OfBusiness and Moglix. But Acharya said that Zetwerk is different. Unlike the others, it makes niche parts and also works for broader industries like aerospace and defence, compared to infrastructure and construction materials, which the other companies focus on.500-employee-strong Zetwerk also opened a US office a few months back, although it has been able to sell remotely to overseas clients for the most part.“There is a lot of depth in Indian manufacturing, and a lot of outlets only utilise 40-50% of capacity. We enable additional utilisation,” Acharya said.The three-year-old startup’s clients include conglomerates such as Tata Power, JSW and L&T. “It was initially difficult to convince big companies, but today they know us.

"The more unsexy a business, the more profitable it is: OfBusiness' Asish Mohapatra's motto",16 August,"Asish Mohapatra is a consummate McKinsey executive - despite having left the firm 10 years ago. When asked something, virtually anything, his answer usually starts with “four reasons”. He will then meticulously go point-by-point, the way consulting firms train their executives to speak.But Mohapatra is not your usual consulting guy. Not by far. Halfway through our interview, Mohapatra asks, “So, are you getting enough masala for your story?” When this reporter says masala may not be the right word, he says, “Okay, I’ll give you some in the next half then.”The co-founder and CEO of B2B unicorn OfBusiness,  Mohapatra has been on a roll.OfBusiness sells industrial goods such as cement, and provides credit for buying them, to small businesses - not a breathtaking or pathbreaking business at first look. And yet, the startup ecosystem has been abuzz about the six-year-old startup’s ongoing funding round, where Tiger Global Management is investing at a $3 billion valuation, a deal Moneycontrol first reported on August 3. This is a few days after Masayoshi Son’s SoftBank led a $150 million round in OfBusiness valuing it at $1.5 billion. That round itself was nearly double its $800 million valuation in April.And yet, not many understand what this lending platform and B2B e-commerce business exactly does. Why is it worth so much? Also why is B2B suddenly so hot?On a car trip from Gurugram to Mansesar (Haryana) to Alwar (Rajasthan), Mohapatra took Moneycontrol’s M. Sriram and Chandra R Srikanth through his obsession with being an unsexy business, debunked fintech myths, spoke about avoiding toxic work cultures, and confessed to being a great salesperson, among other things.Here is the conversation, edited for clarity and context.Asish, you’ve had an interesting career- McKinsey, then a healthcare VC investor, and then a B2B fintech/commerce founder. These are very different things on paper. How did you start OfBusiness?I had done trading in the past. As a consultant and as an investor, your role is limited, and you don’t have control over the outcome. When you give advice, the company may or may not listen. You may travel the world and get paid well, but the reality is you may not do much. Now investing is a probably glorified form of consulting, because you’re putting your money to the advice you give.Even when I was an investor, I was an active operator. I enjoyed being involved with my companies, get into the nitty-gritties of hospitals. Now in 2015-16, I actually saw a lot of people getting into B2B. Really good talent was doing logistics, procurement, and financing, and I said okay, this is the world that I'm from; I'm an operator at heart, so let me jump.It took me a year to get out of Matrix because I was on like seven boards,  nine portfolio companies. So then finally, everything came together in about 2016. Now why B2B? Earlier after being a trader, I ran an SME (small and medium business) for ITC. So I did not have a very regular ITC career.They posted me to run an SME that they had just acquired. Then I started investing in SMEs. All the companies that I invested in healthcare were SMEs. So, the thought was emerging, that you could build a large business by actually combining services like commerce, marketing and financing.This has never been hot because talent and  (investor) money never used to go to B2B. All this changed between 2014-16. Us, Blackbuck, CapitalFloat, Lendingkart, Udaan all started then. That’s when the industry changed.I also started this because honestly, I was never a great investor or consultant. I was a good one. I had this itch to do something. Entrepreneurship is a combination of thinking and doing.But when you were an investor, were your companies okay with you being operationally involved? The founder can feel like you’re interfering.So, unlike consumer tech investing, healthcare investing was a little different. If you have to be good in healthcare, particularly in services, not in pharma, you need to be an outstanding clinician, operationally very good and very commercial. Because unless your healthcare enterprise is profitable, you will be small, and you can’t build an identity.Doctors are mostly busy with the clinical part, and have less time for the other two. I actually used to get welcomed into operational work because 70-80 percent of founders’ time is going into clinical activities. It was a very natural fit. Some of them even became my angel investors (at OfBusiness) Why didn’t you start up in the healthcare space then? Rather than going to something relatively unsexy like B2B commerce and lending?Not many of us can do it. What we have done is hard for the common man to understand. Our aggregation service is difficult to do.Nobody knows what plastic looks like, whether it comes in a bag or is it transported in huge truck loads. Whether it comes loose? Nobody knows. We’re very uncommon. Take tenders. No one knows what a tender looks like. “Kuch toh hoga,” (Must be something) they say.So, I like things which are under the radar because I prefer to be under the radar myself. I like businesses that are under the radar. I make products that are under the radar. I make products that are far away from the limelight, because that is where a business is to be made. See the biggest company in India, Reliance started with textiles, but it got big in Jamnagar with a refinery. That's how they became a big company.  Till then they were one of the textile houses in India.So you revel in being in an unsexy space. But your space is now the hottest. B2B firms are all the rage. So I will add something more unglamorous to it. I will get into contract manufacturing, which nobody wants to touch. I will get into licensed papers which nobody wants to touch. I will make it more and more unglamorous. The more unsexy it is the better it is. Because the reality is, you will always be ahead of competition if you are doing unsexy things.What determines being an unsexy company?Only three metrics. One, it does not have to be in metros. It should be something a common man can't understand. He understands food delivery. Does he understand steel purchase?  Chemical segregation, chlorine? Is chlorine a gas or a liquid? Do a poll, half will say it’s a gas, half will say it’s a liquid. Nobody understands.Thirdly there has to be hard work and education in it. To lend, you have to get the customer, underwrite it (the loan), then you have to convert it, then you have to service it, then you have to collect the money. The more execution there is, the tougher it is to replicate.Asish, ecommerce and new age companies are asked, where is the technology in this business? Just app-based solutions are not cutting-edge today, right? More so, a real tech business also has certain margins, network effects, and scalability. You are in an offline industry. Where is the tech in OfBusiness?So, our business fundamentally happens because of an acquisition engine called BidAssist, which has 2.5 million users. It aggregates tenders. Like they aggregate cement, like they aggregate chlorine, methanol. They aggregate tenders. Tenders are basically revenue opportunities floated by government agenciesAround 18,000 to 19,000 tenders are released in a single day. And they are very non-standardized. A tender of similar nature in Chennai could be 50 pages, in Delhi it's 300 pages. We aggregate these tenders, float it out to all the B2B companies and say, if you need a lot of information about us, we will tell you what tenders are relevant for you. We can show people who can work with you.We will tell you what your probability of winning the tender is. When they come to actually look at these tenders we take them as a lead. And then they pick up our services, commerce or financing. Without that if you’re not using technology for lead acquisition, internet penetration, you're not using technology very well.Technology also helps with efficiency. Proceeding underwriter’s bank statements, auto-reading KYCs, removing variance from GST returns; stuff that people outsource, we do it ourselves. This generates efficiency because we are just 550 people, responsible for a $200 million loan book, a billion dollars of GMV (gross merchandise value) and a marketing service. That’s huge efficiency.The third application of technology is engagement. So general e-commerce customers come in when they want to buy, else they don’t. In our case they come to us once a day, almost 30 times a month, just to see prices, to check tenders or to see what is going on in financing. All that is neatly packaged and made available to the customers for their needs. He is going to use it every day.All our services are made to increase engagement. You won’t want to bid for a tender, but you want to check which new tender has come out  So because it’s a very common service. They  may not even want to buy anything? We want to come and check BidAssist, so even if you have a little money you can stock up. Or to see whether after you bought materials, did the price run away? Did you make the right or wrong choice?Where B2B lacks in tech is for core ordering. Core transactions need offline support. But all peripheral functions, lead acquisition, engagement, completeness, is done using tech. And this has significantly changed after the pandemic.You started with commerce. How did you get into lending?In 2016 February, when we started with e-commerce, just with a smaller market of products than today. And we were using Aditya Birla, Kotak Bank, etc., for being ready with credit. But in six months I realised we would have to do this ourselves because they take too long. Our customers will have other lenders meanwhile; although no other B2B company was lending at this point. We realised waiting won’t fetch anything.Asish, if I look at businesses like cement, the industry has its operators, cartels, dealer networks that determine everything. How do you tackle that?No no, you’re wrong.If you go to chemicals, everything is dog-eat-dog. By the way, it is not the dog-eat-dog in terms of manufacturing, but also in terms of intimidating some suppliers. So, because it is unglamorous there are misconceptions and you believe whatever you hear. Now we beat this dog-eat-dog by locking in the customer, so he is not mercenary just choosing better prices.How do you control NPAs or bad loans? Do you have a first right on payments?Our NPAs are better than that of a few banks and large non-banking finance companies (NBFCs). Let’s come back to the model. Right on payments is meaningless here. Whichever customer comes in, the bank gives him the limit. To use the money largely for buying of raw material or paying salary or paying for his marketing or taxes.So how to handle the installments? He will pay taxes first, or else the company will get closed. So, if he pays salaries first, then only people will come to work. So, leave that aside, that is about 20-30 percent of his payment. Now you’re left with 70- 80 percent of payments, which is used for payment of raw materials, which is Cost of Goods Sold on the balance sheet,He either pays a manufacturer, me or a trader. Now for the guys we serve, manufacturing is not relevant at all because they don’t give credit. Their volumes are not really relevant for the manufacturer. So, it is us versus the trader. There we are always cheaper, and we have financing, an added service.If they delay with me, they’ll have to pay interest. We don't want to replace the banks or the government or salaries for priority of payments. But we do get priority above traders and intermediaries.What is stopping a Zetwerk or an Infra.market from lending as well? What sets you apart?Lending is not easy. You need a lot to build it. You need the ability to source (loans) at a low cost, which we get via BidAssist. The loans themselves come to us. If you spend a lot of money in sourcing, then it will hit your P&L (profit and loss statement) gradually, like it has happened for many other new age lenders.Second, you have to have an underwriting model, which fits exactly with your core service. We lend raw material directly, and the buyer has to pay back in 90 days. There is a service attached to our model, so it works. It is exactly cash flow matched. And third, underwriting is done on the ground. So you have to have a repository of knowledge. You have to behave like a NBFC when it comes to underwriting, and at the same time you have to behave like a new age company to add the service tools.And you need to learn about collections. You guys cover this space, go check out others’ NPAs. At the peak of COVID-19, in June 2020, our peak NPA  was 1.31 percent. Now it is back to 1.1 again. So, you have to have the ability to collect. The old lenders find it easier to collect, because it’s in their DNA. It is easy to sell loans, much harder to collect themYou should know, I head collections, even today. Collections need to be in your DNA, with your whole organization geared towards it. A common advice in lending is to cross-sell, called servicing, so that the cost of lending is cheaper.In our case, he comes to me asking for more. I don’t run the cost of cross-selling. I will give him 10 percent of raw material, he will say, “Sir, you’re cheaper, give me 15 percent no.”So while people can attempt to do it , see I’ve been very vocal about it. I’ll tell you everything that we do. I will never hide anything, or be cagey. Why? Because it's difficult. It will take time. It will take learning. It will take a little bit of capital. It’ll take patience, it’ll take maturity. It will take a lot of understanding of the sectors. Then you can do it. So nothing stops Zetwerk or Infra.market but they will have to build these skills.See, how many A-rated new age financiers do we have, profitable ones? Let me tell you. Us, Five Star Finance, Veritas Finance, Ess Kay Fincorp. Everybody else has a problem. (Side note: All four companies count Norwest Venture Partners as a common investor)What makes your underwriting different?Four things.The other way in which it is different is that while two to three top people are from the industry, everybody else is a fresher. It has been built by people who joined and made their lives out here.  Modeled by our sales team, ops team, underwriting team. All freshers. You’re building it from the ground up, not having to unlearn whatever you learnt elsewhere.Fourth, our underwriting ends with feedback from the ecosystem. Our supplier brethren, who give us the material, they tell us, don’t lend to this person.  His books are good, but his manager is not good, causing delays. We take that seriously. Our risk policy is our risk bible. We never deviate from it.Correct, but Asish, do you think technology plays a role in underwriting? This is something that new age lenders have been trying for a long time, but most of that is marketing?Did you learn these lessons the hard way, from experimentation? Often you know where you want to end up, but the steps are unclear at the beginning.  If you want to build a profitable, high-growth startup, there isn’t much room for experimentation. Those experiments are to be conducted in your head, with a little bit of capital on the ground. It was to -- be honest with you, by actually making sure that the people on the ground who are actually doing our work were the ones who built it.We hire freshers from just outside the top business schools, except ABCL (the IIM’s in Ahmedabad, Bangalore, Calcutta and Lucknow) .We get the cream of candidates from there. So, these guys are very smart, very hungry. They want to make a difference, because they lost out in the early days because they did not get into ABCL. They have brains and hunger. And we said, don’t make it too different from how it has traditionally been done on the groundEvery trader, every shopkeeper, thinks about their credit risk. Understand that and build your own model. And not like we are the first ones doing it. Bajaj did it for retail loans. HDFC did it for corporate banking. They aligned themselves to the market, perfectly matching how business should be done.You talk a lot about profitability. Are you profitable, on a net profit or EBITDA basis (which covers operating costs)?Oh very. We have been profitable since day one in financing and we’re too in commerce. We are currently at a profit run rate of about $20 million. Our profit target this fiscal is $60 million, Rs 450 crore. That’s more important than being  a unicorn.What is your revenue?See, in our commerce business, that entire $1.1 billion GMV that we make is revenue because we buy and sell. We aren’t a typical marketplace. Our margins here range from 5-8 percent. If you go to our financing business, our book is about $220 million. There our yield will be about 18 percent.Raising all this money from top investors, do you feel pressure? VC money looks glamorous from the outside, but comes with 20-30 percent IRR (Internal Rate of Return) expectations.To tell you the truth, if a person doesn’t work under pressure, then he cannot win  Olympic medals.. Indians have traditionally not delivered under pressure, and that’s what we have to change.How do you and Ruchi  (Kalra, wife and co-founder) split up your work? Are there specific things that she looks and  you look at?At a very high level, she looks at the financing business while I look at commerce. She's supposed to make sure that the money is raised right and used right, while my job is to make sure money is made. They're very neatly separated. So commerce is done by me, financing is done between Vasant (Sridhar) and Ruchi, agriculture is done by Nitin (Jain). Bhuvan (Gupta) looks at technology including our marketing service.Anything financing you go to Vasant  and Ruchi who again have a neat split in financing. Anything in agri- Nitin, anything non-agri will go to me. My fundamental belief is as long as people have deep respect for each other but clear separations of work they will always co-exist. If you think the guy is right and he’ll do it, you don’t need to go there.Do you and Ruchi also have to keep an effort to sort of keep your relationship and your work separate? If you speak to Ruchi, she’s a completely different person. People point that out about us actually.  Vasant also is 24/7, Nitin also a 24/7. There is no gap between office and home.But when this kind of culture is glorified, isn’t that what leads to a toxic workplace? People aren’t happy, the culture becomes aggressive and people feel like they have no life outside this and you lose your sense of identity. I think for us this danger is relatively less, because we didn’t start when we were 20-somethings. See, when I started my entrepreneurial journey I was 35, I had already worked for 14 years. My co-founder, Bhuvan Gupta, who leads technology is two years elder to me and had worked for 15 years. Ruchi was 33. Most of us growing up had seen some business or the other.I had seen trading, Ruchi had seen retailing, Bhuvan had seen retailing, Nitin had seen hoteling. Nitin had already worked for nine years. Vasant had worked for 5 years. In my opinion, toxicity comes in when the guy thinks this is fine. He has not seen another life. We spent time at blue-chip companies, McKinsey, ITC, Airtel, Bharti-SoftBank, Royal Bank of Scotland - companies known for their culture.I sound that way because I’m a good salesman (chuckles). But I’ll tell you what I’m worried about.The biggest challenge for me is that we've become quite big quite soon, particularly in the last three years. In the first couple of years, we all knew each other, we knew our customers, there was that familiarity. The vision cascaded down to the last guy. What happens when you're 10x of that size? And have we lost touch with the last guy on the ground? Is he thinking the same way that we are? Which is why we keep traveling to each office, calling everybody, going out. It is getting tougher as we scale.Secondly, our business is fundamentally non-metro. Tier 2 cities peripheries and all that. The average guy who's a fresher does not want to stay there. He wants to be in the metros, have a girlfriend, go to malls, theatres and all that. That is not there in the places we work. So how do you get them enthused? How do you keep him intertwined with our culture? That is getting increasingly difficult.The third thing that is getting difficult is that today we are not very big, but we are big enough that some flanks are open And they typically get attacked by small, aggressive companies.  So how do you keep your flanks completely tight?If flanks are open, category killers will come, focused category killers will come, maybe in a single supply chain, maybe some financing which is a subset of ours.Fourth, we have reached a scale where the next 10 years will be decided by technology. Technology will be the enabler, but it will be built by these new age companies. We have to see whether we are at the forefront of it. Else Jio or Tata will get you.  Are you at the forefront of it, where it is impossible to make another OfBusiness? Where it is impossible to copy.  These are the things, on a high level, which I worry about.You have reasonable scale today, are well capitalised and growing. Have you thought of an IPO? What are your focus areas for, say the next 6 to 12 months?  We want both businesses to grow 3x in a year and 10x in two years. I am faced with very deep markets, which give me the chance to do that. I have a great team which is raring to go. And I think I have very good backers (investors) who don't just have capital, but they fundamentally believe in what we do.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/the-more-unsexy-a-business-the-more-profitable-it-is-ofbusiness-asish-mohapatras-motto-7338491.html,Funding,"To lend, you have to get the customer, underwrite it (the loan), then you have to convert it, then you have to service it, then you have to collect the money.You have to behave like a NBFC when it comes to underwriting, and at the same time you have to behave like a new age company to add the service tools.And you need to learn about collections.",[],"['$3 billion', '$150 million', '$1.5 billion', '$800 million', '$200 million', 'a billion dollars', 'about $20 million', '$60 million', '$1.1 billion', 'about $220 million']"

SBICap Ventures starts disbursement of funds for six projects of stuck Amrapali Group,10 August,"SBICAP Ventures, the manager for the government's Rs 25,000-crore stressed-asset fund, has started disbursement for the six projects by the erstwhile Amrapali Group located in Noida and Greater Noida.“The disbursement has started.

Availability of capital will no longer be a deterrent for the progress of the project,” Irfan A Kazi, Chief Investment Officer of the SWAMIH Investment Fund told Moneycontrol on August 10.SBICap had on August 4 signed an MoU with the court receiver appointed by the Supreme Court to monitor stuck Amrapali projects for funding Rs 650 crore for six projects in Noida and Greater Noida.Also Read: Exclusive | After SWAMIH Fund, 10 banks show interest in funding stalled Amrapali projectsAccording to the MoU, as many as 6,947 homes will be completed with the funding.SBI Cap is funding Rs 650 crore for six projects to bridge the temporary liquidity gap.The projects receiving the funds include Silicon City-1, Silicon City-2, Crystal Homes, Centurian Park- Low Rise, O2 Valley and Tropical Garden where 6,947 units are stalled of which 6,132 units are sold but homebuyers are awaiting delivery.These projects were launched almost about 10 years ago between 2011 and 2013 and have been delayed for more than 4-5 years from their promised delivery timeline.

"Meet Pratilipi, the content startup shaping the future of reading, writing and publishing",04 August,"Regional language self-publishing platform Pratilipi recently raised $48 million in a Series D round led by South Korean gaming platform Krafton. The startup was founded in 2015 by Ranjeet Pratap Singh, Rahul Ranjan, Sankarnarayan Devarajan, Sahradayi Modi and Prashant Gupta. Pratilipi is a self-publishing and audiobooks portal that houses various Indian languages like Hindi, Kannada, Malayalam, Tamil, Telugu, Gujrati, Marathi, and Bengali, Urdu, and English.Pratilipi has over 3.5 lakh (0.35 million) writers and has published over 4.5 million stories in ten Indian languages. In addition, the platform has over 28.5 million monthly active readers. The company also has other products under its belt, including Pratilipi literature, Pratilipi comics, and Pratilipi FM. The comics and FM categories have over 8 lakh and 3 lakh active users, respectively.In an interview with Moneycontrol, Ranjeet Pratap Singh spoke about competition, content moderation and how the pandemic has affected Pratilipi. Edited Excerpts:Q: How is Pratilipi any different from a physical book?A: From a writer's perspective, you have to wait to publish a book. One cannot publish chapter by chapter, as opposed to Pratilipi, where you don't have to wait for two years to write a book. An author can start publishing one chapter, and they can interact with their readers and fellow writers to see which part of the story their audience can relate with and mold the story accordingly.I am a massive Game of Thrones fan from a reader's perspective, and I have been waiting for a decade for the next book to come out. I don't have to do that with Pratilipi.Secondly, I can support the writer directly, not just monetarily but also through talking to them and giving them feedback, and I can also connect with other fans of the same story and author and talk to them. This is the significant difference between the writers and readers' perspectives.Q: How will Pratilipi inculcate a long-form reading habit amongst this generation of readers?A: Forget about long-form, forget about reading. It's more like if you are interested in reading, watching, or listening to something can I provide you with access to it. We are not trying to change consumer behavior, if that happens, it's excellent, but that's not what we are trying to do. All we aim to do is if you want to read, you should have access to it. In our case, for example, we have now started publishing traditional books and comics.Q: What is your business/revenue model?A: We think of Pratilipi as a holding company, where we will have multiple products. Hopefully, these will become independent public companies in the future. So that means different products will have other cost structures, monetization models, teams, etc. I will start with literature because that is what Pratilipi is known for; today, there are three revenue models, and there is a fourth one which we will launch some time.At the top tier, if a story is compelling, we will acquire the rights for the story and pay the writers, and we will get the revenue share. That will leverage into different formats, including our comics and audio and some via licensing to a movie, a Netflix show, a series in MX Player, a game.In these cases, the company will pay us upfront or will give us a revenue share. Another form of monetization is called a creative subscription, which we launched about three months back. If you want to support a creator, you can subscribe to the creator and get some exclusive features like early access to content, and through this, some money goes to the creator, and some money comes to Pratilipi.For comics, we have early paper access. Comics are released on a weekly schedule, so if a reader wants to read the next chapter early, they can pay a small amount of money and will be able to read, but for those who can wait, the same chapter will be available for free in the following week. Finally, for IVM, it's primarily trans-advertising. We also want to launch a podcast subscription bill, but as of now, it's not available yet.Q: What scale is required for you to think of Pratilipi as an unmitigated success?A: Unlike an enterprise, where some company gets a million dollars in Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) and you know the company is working, consumer trends are different; you don't know till you get to a vast scale. My best guess is that maybe somewhere around 50-60 million users will get to the point where the business is working.I think the network gets easier at 50 million users. The network starts kicking in at a million Monthly Active Users (users) and at 10 million mau, one can start seeing the numbers where explanation of the business is not necessary. At 50 million MAU things just magically fall into place.Q: Is content moderation a priority? For example, can erotica be a part of what one writes and consumes?A: There are three kinds of things people like in erotica. One is pornography which is illegal in India. The second is soft porn which you would see a lot in user-generated content (UGC) and quasi UGC OTT platforms. The third is what is actual erotica. Porn is not allowed in Pratilipi.Erotica is more of a strategic choice; for example, for English content it would be treated like any other content, but for Indian languages, the story's visibility will be restricted. I am not against erotica, but we want the platform to have more diversity, and most of the writers of Indian languages are first-time writers, so we want to bring in the diversity.Q: Is there an editorial team to pre-qualify the publication of stories?A: We have automated data models, so pornography is a tiny part of it; our biggest problem is copyright violation. We have many data models that try to weed out content that is illegal in one way. We will try to find out which content violates any of the copyright rules, and in all cases, the first time the mistake is identified, the content is deleted. The writer is given a warning the second time it happens, the author's profile is blocked.Q: What is the biggest challenge for Pratilipi?A: The biggest challenge is always finding the best people to work with you and how you keep pushing them to become better, motivated, and take on challenges.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/startup/meet-pratilipi-the-content-startup-shaping-the-future-of-reading-writing-and-publishing-7272931.html,Funding,"I will start with literature because that is what Pratilipi is known for; today, there are three revenue models, and there is a fourth one which we will launch some time.At the top tier, if a story is compelling, we will acquire the rights for the story and pay the writers, and we will get the revenue share.I am not against erotica, but we want the platform to have more diversity, and most of the writers of Indian languages are first-time writers, so we want to bring in the diversity.Q: Is there an editorial team to pre-qualify the publication of stories?A: We have automated data models, so pornography is a tiny part of it; our biggest problem is copyright violation.",['Pratilipi'],"['$48 million', 'a million dollars']"
Exclusive: Tiger Global may back OfBusiness at $3 billion valuation,03 August,"Lending and e-commerce firm OfBusiness is in talks to raise funds valuing it at $3 billion, doubling from $1.5 billion in a SoftBank-led round recently, said three people aware of the matter.Tiger Global Management- the New York-based firm upending the investment world is expected to invest about $150 million at $3 billion post money, said the people cited above, requesting anonymity.OfBusiness, founded in 2015 by former McKinsey executive and venture capitalist Asish Mohapatra, lends via a non-banking finance company (NBFC) to small and medium enterprises which have a turnover between Rs 20-Rs 200 crore.It lends by  providing raw material- which the company would use the money to buy anyway- in addition to just capital and offers a credit line at an interest rate of 1.5% per month.The company claims SMEs get the best price for their raw material requirements via OfBusiness’s bidding platform. Its technology platform negotiates with more than 100 manufacturers and suppliers across India to get best guarantee prices on structural steel, polymer, paper and cement.Discussions with Tiger are still at an early stage and the deal is expected to close over the next few months.Tiger and OfBusiness declined to comment.On the face of it, OfBusiness’ valuation has grown by four times in as many months, given that it raised funds at an $800 million valuation in April. However, people said that the SoftBank round- which Moneycontrol first reported in June- was based on OfBusiness’ numbers from early this year- discussions prolonged due to the coronavirus second wave.“They’re raising at double the price because they have grown 30-40% this year, despite pandemic related setbacks. It is aggressive, but such is the market,” said one person aware of talks.Its other investors include Falcon Edge Capital, Norwest Venture Partners, Matrix Partners and most recently, SoftBankIndia is currently witnessing a record funding boom for internet companies, with startups raising money at double and triple their previous valuations every few months. Earlier today, construction marketplace Infra.Market raised $125 million from Tiger, valuing it at $2.5 billion, compared to $1 billion in April.OfBusiness and Infra.Market target similar customers, but Business is selling larger quantities and is operating in bigger categories than Infra.market, which is running a private label to sell stone materials, concrete, and walling solutions.OfBusiness may also go public in the next two-three years or so, people said, but no concrete plans have been made.This also won’t be the first time Tiger will invest in competing companies in a sector- generally a strict no-no for venture investors.It has earlier invested in Upstox and Groww- both online investment platforms; gaming firms Dream11 and My11Circle, and online education firms Byju’s, Unacademy and Vedantu.

"Infra.Market valued at $2.5 billion, raises $125 million from Tiger Global",03 August,"Construction materials marketplace Infra.Market said on August 3 that it has raised $125 million from existing investor Tiger Global Management, valuing it at $2.6 billion-  a jump of nearly three times in just over three months.Moneycontrol first wrote about the deal on June 29.Founded by Souvik Sengupta and Aaditya Sharda in 2016, Infra.Market is a business-to-business (B2B) e-commerce firm, running a brand of construction material, concrete and chemicals used in infrastructure projects.

Amrapali case | SC asks banks to relax funding criteria for stalled Amrapali projects,02 August,"The Supreme Court on August 2 asked banks to relax the funding criteria for stalled Amrapali projects that include submission of collateral security and corporate guarantees, saying that lending to the projects be treated as a special case since it was being monitored under the supervision of the apex court.The two-member bench comprising Justices U U Lalit and Ajay Rastogi asked banks to hold a joint meeting with the court receiver by August 8 to arrive at a consensus on funding, lawyers present at the hearing told Moneycontrol.“Funding of these projects is the fundamental problem the court and the receiver are trying to resolve. With funds coming from SWAMIH fund and Supreme Court stepping in to ensure that funding from banks is made available to these projects, the uncertainty hovering over these projects can be tackled to a large extent. We are hopeful that the scheduled meeting between the banks and the receiver would yield some solutions for these projects and the buyers therein,” Kumar Mihir, advocate, representing Amrapali homebuyers told Moneycontrol.The order is awaited.Earlier, the Supreme Court-appointed court receiver R Venkataramani, tasked with monitoring the construction of Amrapali projects, had said in a note submitted before the apex court that banks and prospective lenders had raised an issue with regard to ASPIRE that was registered but does not have a credit rating as a company or past history of performance.In view of the SWAMIH funding being cleared in favour of ASPIRE, the above should not be an issue, he had said.He had asked the apex court to issue a set of directions that banks and financial agencies who are in deliberations with him, shall not insist on any collateral security in addition to the assets of Amrapali which can be duly offered as sufficient security, proportionate to the quantum of funds that may be released/sanctioned.He had also said that the computation of the commercial viability of the projects be treated as sufficient towards asset valuation and realisables from assets including unsold inventories.Earlier, NBCC had also apprised the court receiver of the constraints faced by it for raising funds towards completion of stalled projects of the embattled firm. These included issues such as ASPIRE SPV not having any past history and credit rating as it is a newly formed entity.It had also told the court receiver during a meeting held on July 29 that majority of banks had raised the issue of non-availability of collateral security in the form of mortgage of other assets/ sovereign and corporate guarantee or a letter of comfort.Banks have been asking NBCC for a letter of comfort for financing the project.The court had in 2019 asked the government’s construction arm to finish and deliver 38,159 flats by 2023 after several homebuyers sought its intervention, complaining about years of delay in handing over their homes.The SC on October 13,2020 had permitted the court receiver to incorporate a special purpose vehicle (SPV) to enable flow of funds from SBICap for completion of unfinished projects.It is for this reason that the company Amrapali Stalled Projects Investments Reconstruction Establishment (ASPIRE) has been floated. It consists of a court receiver, a forensic auditor and a chartered accountant. It is a not-for-profit company under Section 8 of Companies Act, 2013.ASPIRE announced the sale of the units through an open draw in March 2021.

Exclusive: Tiger in talks to back months-old Mensa brands at $400 million valuation,02 August,"Tiger Global Management is in talks to invest in former Myntra CEO Ananth Narayanan’s ecommerce roll-up firm Mensa Brands, only months after it raised its first round and before it has shown any meaningful traction, led by rapid acquisitions and a growing market, sources said.Mensa, modeled on US-based breakout unicorn Thrasio, could raise about $20 million in the round led by Tiger, valuing it between $400-500 million, said these people, who requested anonymity since discussions are private. Mensa was valued at about $65 million in its Series A round in May.Mensa plans to acquire fast-growing ecommerce sellers in the apparel, home appliance, personal care and beauty space, with annual revenues of Rs 7-70 crore ($1-10 million roughly). Mensa’s pitch to these brands is that it can help accelerate their growth, provide digital marketing and technology chops and help them even expand globally.It has signed Letter of Intents to acquire 15 companies so far, more than it had expected, part of the reason why it is raising money again, said one person aware of the matter, requesting anonymity since discussions are private. Mensa goes from first discussion with a seller to cash in the bank in four weeks, as per its website.Tiger and Mensa did not respond to queries from Moneycontrol seeking comment.These roll-up brands typically use a mix of debt and equity and fund their acquisitions. Debt is cheaper to raise and carries a lower cost of capital than equity- on which investors expect a handsome return, due to which investors recommend that these upstarts fund buyouts via debt.For this reason, Mensa and others have raised debt along with equity, something early stage startups don’t usually do. In its much-touted $50 million Series A round, around $30 million is debt commitments from Alteria and InnoVen Capital. This money has only been committed and will be given to the company when it has to actually acquire the brands. The equity was raised from venture firm Accel, Falcon Edge Capital and Norwest Venture Partners.Notably, Scott Shleifer, partner at Tiger and co-founder of its private equity unit is an angel investor in Mensa, even as Tiger itself invested in GOAT Brand Labs, another ecommerce roll-up firm that competes directly with Mensa. Tiger led a $36 million round in GOAT, founded by Flipkart’s former fashion chief Rishi Vasudev, along with Flipkart Ventures and Mayfield.“Tiger’s investment in Mensa seems like more of an experiment. GOAT was their main bet, and they are taking a relatively small stake in Mensa. Although competing bets isn’t new to Tiger,” said a second person aware of the transaction.Tiger has led the startup funding boom in India and globally, giving young internet companies more money at higher valuations than ever seen before. Its speed and aggression has surprised even entrepreneurs and venture capitalists familiar with their workingsThe roll-up space has seen close to $300 million in funding already, before any of these companies have made any actual acquisitions, driven by the growing market and investor aggression. Global Bees, co-founded by FirstCry founder Supam Maheshwari, raised a record $150 million Series A funding, while half a dozen others have raised $5-50 million and are raising more currently. Moneycontrol broke down and analysed the frenzy here.One investor who evaluated Mensa found its valuation and pitch aggressive, with the $400-500 million ask said to be justified by the revenues of all its to-be acquired companies growing quickly, although their individual futures, integration into Mensa, and larger market dynamics are still uncertain.Narayanan acknowledged that integration is important in an interview with Moneycontrol in June. “You have to be clear about what expertise each person brings...as we look for the right brands, one of the things we do assess is the quality of the founder, and whether the founder is somebody that we want to work with constantly, day in and day out,” he said.However, another person close to the company said that aggression is the default model of this space, especially when everyone is raising money in record time. “If you had to bet on one person in this space, I would pick Ananth,” this person said. Former McKinsey senior partner Narayanan is one of India’s best known startup executives, having been Myntra’s CEO before he joined online pharmacy Medlife as its CEO. Medlife was acquired by TPG-backed PharmEasy last year, following which he left and started Mensa.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/startup/exclusive-tiger-in-talks-to-back-months-old-mensa-brands-at-400-million-valuation-7258801.html,Funding,"Tiger Global Management is in talks to invest in former Myntra CEO Ananth Narayanan’s ecommerce roll-up firm Mensa Brands, only months after it raised its first round and before it has shown any meaningful traction, led by rapid acquisitions and a growing market, sources said.Mensa, modeled on US-based breakout unicorn Thrasio, could raise about $20 million in the round led by Tiger, valuing it between $400-500 million, said these people, who requested anonymity since discussions are private.“You have to be clear about what expertise each person brings...as we look for the right brands, one of the things we do assess is the quality of the founder, and whether the founder is somebody that we want to work with constantly, day in and day out,” he said.However, another person close to the company said that aggression is the default model of this space, especially when everyone is raising money in record time.","['Myntra', 'Mensa Brands', 'Mensa']","['about $20 million', 'between $400-500 million', 'about $65 million', '$1-10 million', '$50 million', 'around $30 million', '$36 million', 'close to $300 million', 'a record $150 million', '$5-50 million', '$400-500 million']"

"Startups don’t need just money, they need help and mentoring, India’s newest VC fund Together says",30 July,"Some of India's top entrepreneurs and investors have come ‘together’ to start a new venture fund (pun intended). Freshworks’ Girish Mathrubootham, Eka Software’s Manav Garg and former Matrix Partners investor Shubham Gupta, have launched an $85 million fund- named Together- meant to back innovative software and product startups.In a Twitter Spaces session with Moneycontrol’s Chandra R. Srikanth and M. Sriram, they spoke about their investing thesis, raising a fund during India’s biggest startup boom, splitting time between being entrepreneurs and investors and the opportunity in hand. Here are key takeaways-Why Together Fund now? What are they addressing?Girish Mathrubootham: We always wanted to accelerate the dream of India as a product nation. We realised that money is a commodity. What startups need is not money; they need operational help; they need the right mentoring, make adjustments in the early days to get to product-market fit, address large enough markets, expand the product vision, and hire the best teams to scale. Everything except money was missing in terms of early-stage advice. The name Together means we want to bring everybody in the ecosystem together. Shubham Gupta: I always wanted to be a founder, and a stint I was trying to do for the last 10-11 years but I couldn't find a problem statement that I was passionate about. Working as an angel investor for the last 8 years taught me one thing that it is something I truly wanted to do. So in 2019 I moved back to India. Being a founder has been a true calling for me and when I got the chance to build this with two exceptional entrepreneurs who I truly respect, it was a no brainer for me. You can be a founder and also have a philosophy of helping founders in a very differentiated way. So the amalgamation of all these things got me together. Existing VCs promise a lot of the same things. Why would startups pitch to you?Girish Mathrubootham: What you are missing is how many startups are coming. We are going to see a ton more global B2B (Business-to-Business) startups coming from India. Many startups need access to capital. Often, we work with other VCs like Accel and Sequoia; sometimes we write the first cheque, sometimes they do. It is not like competition with other VCs. By the end of the day, if a founder gets funded, we are happy. Our goal is that founders must win. Manav Garg: Looking at it from a founder's perspective, they have many questions from the start, how to get the funding agreements, should I move to the US or not, how do I get my first five customers; after the first five customers should I hire a sales manager? There is a new product-led growth wave going on, what is the best way to design a product for the user. These are some things where we are well equipped to help the founders. For a founder, they have the option of going to an operator-led fund to help him through the process. What was fundraising during a boom market like? Was it easier than expected?Shubham Gupta: The fundamental thought process for Together is long-term thinking. Be it our founders, the way we are interacting with founders; even in terms of LPs (Limited Partners) we went for long-term institutional capital. We are a Mauritius-based fund, most of our LPs are from US institutions. Obviously, it was not a cakewalk, we pitched our story. Girish, Manav and myself, we spoke to a lot of these LPs who believed in our story. They believed in our mission to really help India as a product nation. The market has also favoured us, this is a good market for fundraisers. We are fortunate that we raised the fund and are now investing. What should one pitch to get funding? And how will you split your time?Girish Mathrubootham: Vast majority of deals will be in B2B SaaS (Software-as-a-service) space. It's not just the two of us (Girish and Manav); the power of Together comes from the network of 150 founders who have skin in the game. They have pledged their time to help founders with contextual help. The opportunities will open for developer tools, consumer startups like ed-tech and fintech. We want to find the next set of global product champions from India. We are open to looking at any startups, but we are getting SaaS startups as of now. As for time, you watch Sachin Tendulkar or MS Dhoni because they play cricket right, irrespective of how much money advertisements may bring them? Cricket is their identity. Similarly for me, being CEO of Freshworks is the main purpose of course. The biggest challenge for TogetherGirish Mathrubootham: Talent is going to be the biggest challenge for all of us, including startups. How do we get more ready-made talent from the industry? The opportunity is ample and is there, and we need smart founders who can crack it. Manav Garg: I agree. Talent. To give you some data points, right now, if you look at the SaaS ecosystem, they employ about 40,000 people, and we expect it to go to half a million jobs by 2030.

"SMEs, startups should start raising funds through capital market, say experts",29 July,"The micro, small and medium enterprises sector in India is said to be the second-largest employment creator after agriculture, providing employment to an estimated 11 crore people. It contributes 30 percent of the GDP and accounts for 48 percent of the exports.However, as a result of the consecutive lockdowns in 2020 and 2021, the MSME sector has been facing a wide range of issues including massive liquidity and supply crunch, shortage of labour and non-payment of dues.Speaking at a FICCI webinar on Alternate Sources of MSME Funding & Start-up Listing, RK Chhajer, Chair, FICCI MSME Committee, West Bengal said, ""A common challenge that the SMEs and startups face is a lack of access to appropriate capital, both from the banking sector and from capital markets due to stringent conditions. Moreover, in the last few years in India, the banking circle has become more regressive because of NPAs which have come into the system and bankers have become very wary of giving loans.""Chhajer further said that it is essential that SMEs access the capital market to raise equity capital and stressed that the exchanges must support SMEs and startups so that they can raise funds and keep their business running.""Listed SMEs and startups will become globally competitive and offer a significant contribution to India's economic development and job creation,"" he noted.With the current pandemic situation and increasing uncertainties, SMEs and startups need to look beyond traditional fund raising options and explore alternate routes for wealth and fund creation not only for increased valuation, but also for image building and branding, Chhajer observed.Mou Sen, Joint Director of MSME, Directorate of MSME, Govt. of West Bengal also emphasised the need for SME and startup funding from the capital market. ""The growth potential of the startups is very large and so is their need for credit. However, banks call for a lot of documentation before increasing the credit limit,"" Sen noted.Jayesh Taori, AVP, Listing BD, National Stock Exchange of India, also highlighted the need for MSMEs to look beyond the traditional route of raising credit through banks.""We are providing them with the opportunity so they can raise equity capital from the market.

With Together, we are not just offering capital to founders, we are offering our time and counsel as well. We have brought together a large network of more than 150 founders and operators across India and Silicon Valley to provide contextual help and guidance,"" Freshworks CEO Mathrubootham said. He added that his personal ambition for the fund is not about making it the most successful VC firm but to make it the most founder-friendly, a sentiment that his founding partner Manav Garg echoes. ""In today's world, capital is a commodity. We don’t want to be an investor - we want to be like a co-founder. While we do want to deliver financial returns on our investments, that is secondary to our imperative to ensure that we do right by the founder at all times"" Garg said. He also said that both founders being active entrepreneurs themselves gives them perspective and an advantage that other software investors don’t have.Mathrubootham is also a prolific angel investor, with more than 60 investments in startups including software firm Whatfix and edtech startup Unacademy. Going forward, however, he and the other partners won't be doing angel investments. Their fund will be separate and their historical investments will not be part of it.Together has also roped in Shubham Gupta, who used to lead SaaS investments for venture capital firm Matrix Partners, as a founding partner.

It has already committed investments to 7 startups that are currently in stealth mode. Avinash Raghava, who worked on community initiatives within the Indian startup ecosystem in organisations such as Nasscom, iSpirt and venture firm Accel, will lead Together community and culture initiatives.  The fund aims to capitalise on the enterprise cloud software boom underway globally and in India.

"Want to IPO in 12-18 months, going public is a big aspiration: Byju Raveendran",27 July,"What is Byju's? Depending on whom you ask, answers range from a venture capital fund, a private equity fund, a proxy for the government’s education policy (or lack of it), or everyone’s favourite subject of memes or criticism. Byju’s, which has spent over $2 billion in acquisitions the last six months, is said to acquire the national CBSE school board- a common joke on Twitter these days.Jokes apart, billionaire founder Byju Raveendran’s dealmaking spree conveys his ambition. Press releases issued by Byju’s recently call it the world’s largest edtech company. Most recently, the $16.5 billion company acquired upskilling firm Great Learning for $600 million. In an interview with Moneycontrol, Raveendran and Great Learning founder and CEO Mohan Lakhamraju talk about why upskilling courses are going to become as common as health checkups, being bootstrapped, and the Chinese government’s recent death knell to edtech companies. Edited excerptsQ: You have been on an acquisition spree in the last six months? What's the larger rationale- both with Great Learning and the broader vision for Byju's?Byju: This gives us an entry into a new space which has very high potential. We have seen a great opportunity and Great Learning has achieved so much scene with efficiency and being bootstrapped, it is phenomenal. That too in a very competitive space. Over the last 3-4 years they have been growing at 100 percent (year on year) . When we saw that kind of model, we had to make sure there was enough of an opportunity. This is the right time we are entering this space and entering in a big way. This is one of our largest acquisitions and we will be investing more to scale this in India and abroad In a similar way, Aakash is making a strong entry into the test prep space where we are creating a hybrid model (online and offline) for test prep. Great Learning will be our vehicle for professional upskilling and higher education. In our core segment (K12), we see continued growth and that has been scaling 100 percent year on year.We have launched in Latin America where we got a very good start. All three segments in India - school, test prep, and Great Learning- other than Aakash, everything is scalable in international markets. Why are we doing all this? Because this sector has been grossly under-invested in, completely neglected by everyone, I strongly believe that we have an opportunity to redefine this space globally. This is not a cut, copy paste model of what is working in other markets, Starting in India is an advantage in this spaceWe understand the deal is a mix of cash, stock, earnout. Can you give us a breakup and the new investments you are making in the upskilling space?We cannot disclose right now. We will be making significant investments in the near term. Aspiration here is to create a global leader in this space.This has also come at a time when you have been on a fundraising spree. The two things are self-explanatory. We have done these big acquisitions like Aakash, Epic, and Great Learning and raised funds for that. Our core model is already profitable. We have raised $1.5 billion in the current round. Even after all these acquisitions, we will have a billion dollars in the bank.What is your (Great Learning’s)  differentiation vs peers such as Eruditus, Upgrad and Simplilearn? 2-3 things. The quality of our programmes, the support, guidance and mentorship, not just content. We use an efficient combination of content, technology and people and that is what has given us completion rates of over 90 percent and very high student satisfaction rates. That is what has helped to get to this stage without spending too much money. You were the head of the hedge fund Tiger Global before you started up. And Tiger is one of the most active investors in the Indian startup ecosystem. Yet you chose to be bootstrapped...What was the thinking there? Once you have been on the other side, you know how things work. You have already learnt the best things. In the beginning, when we chose to delay raising money, we wanted to get the model right and we wanted to make sure of the outcomes. Traditional high-quality education is accessible to very few people. We wanted to be an inclusive platform where everyone who wants to learn can experience the magic of transformational education. If you raise money too soon, you don't have an opportunity to get it right. When we got it right, we didn't really need to raise money. We have never been short of money. We started a fundraising process a few months back because there were opportunities that opened upRead: Why Byju's is betting big on the upskilling spaceDo you see your space as competitive? You are fighting for the same pie, so do you wonder about market leadership? When we started in 2013, there were 40 companies that were offering upskilling programmes. It has been competitive for a long time. The market itself has grown tremendously.Earlier, upskilling was not a mainstream thing. Now it has become mainstream. For most people going forward, this is going to be standard behaviour, just like a health check-up and car upgrades, you will be upgrading skills as well. There has been a massive expansion of upskilling space.In the higher education space, the pandemic has put focus on the lack of digital adoption that regulatory authorities have created enabling provisions to adopt tech and online learning. Those have created tailwinds for higher education to adopt tech and move onlineWe are also seeing a rush of Internet IPOs. Because of investor appetite for consumer tech, have you become more open minded about listing in India?It is good to see investors valuing growth. We have made our plans based on our timelines and what we see. But it is very encouraging to see the response that Zomato got. Being an India-based company, we now know there is a pool of investors who value internet companies. We will evaluate at the right time if we should list in India or the US. It can be first here or second later. We will evaluate in 12-18 months. By the time, we will have a significant presence in the US, we will have 3 companies doing  over $100 million in revenue. There will be a huge opportunity to list in the US or in India.Over the weekend, we saw Chinese ed-tech stocks and the industry crash because the government flipped rules overnight, banning online tutoring startups, saying they should be not-for-profit and can’t have foreign investors aid. How do you see that sort of regulatory flip? Indian ed-techs and investors have often looked to China to emulate their scale and model.I still believe the kind of impact some of those companies had on the Chinese education system is the reason why China became a very strong force. Current regulation is anyone's guess. It has wiped out a lot of value. Some of them have been there for decades.While the situation here is close to nowhere close to China, does it give you pause to dial down aggression, make your program inclusive or come up with a pricing program that is more accessible?On the one hand, we are creating a very large for-profit education business. We are not denying that. But we are also trying to create a very large not-for-profit in the same sector, making sure that the bottom 50 percent are not missing out.We have created an initiative which we call Byju's education for all. We have added an equal number of students to that platform supporting the underprivileged, we are working with 41 partners. We are providing the same content and product without cannibalizing the core product.It is not because of Chinese regulation. I have gone to a government school where, let alone good teachers, finding teachers itself was a challenge because most of them would go for political work. I know these challenges first hand.But does the regulatory environment make you nervous, because it is a sign of regulators globally becoming more savvy or reactive? You can always comply with regulations. The bigger challenge is when regulation changes, Many people are telling me this is a bigger opportunity for Indian ed-tech. We stand to benefit the maximum. A lot more money is going to chase the Indian companies. India and Indian ed-tech will define how everyone will learn globally. Most of our models are very innovative. We are far ahead of the US ed-tech companies in that way.Can you give us a break up of revenue, country-wise in terms of percentage? There is so much opportunity in India itself, so despite aggressive overseas expansion, India is the biggest. Even after 4-5 years, India will still be 60 percent of revenue. We will be one of the largest players in the K-8 space. With all the IPO talk, how important is that for you? Private capital is flowing freely and you can always give investors exit via secondary share sales?We don't need to do an IPO to give exit to investors. Staying private is an option but creating a large public company coming out of India is a big aspiration. We strongly believe the next big milestone should be going public. Read: BYJU's acquires learning app Toppr and upskilling platform Great Learning",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/want-to-ipo-in-12-18-months-going-public-big-aspiration-byju-raveendran-7226841.html,Funding,"This is one of our largest acquisitions and we will be investing more to scale this in India and abroad In a similar way, Aakash is making a strong entry into the test prep space where we are creating a hybrid model (online and offline) for test prep.Some of them have been there for decades.While the situation here is close to nowhere close to China, does it give you pause to dial down aggression, make your program inclusive or come up with a pricing program that is more accessible?On the one hand, we are creating a very large for-profit education business.",['Aakash'],"['over $2 billion', '$16.5 billion', '$600 million', '$1.5 billion', 'a billion dollars', 'over $100 million']"
"Thrasio-style GOAT Brand Labs raises $36 million from Tiger Global, Flipkart Ventures, Mayfield",26 July,"GOAT Brand Labs, the latest among a slew of startups looking to build a house of digital-first consumer brands, said on July 26 that it has raised $36 million in its first-ever funding round from Tiger Global Management, Flipkart Ventures and Mayfield.GOAT, which stands for Greatest Of All Time was started by Rishi Vasudev, who headed Flipkart Fashion and Landmark Group’s Lifestyle International; along with Rameswar Misra, who worked in the direct-to-consumer and apparel space for nearly seven years.Other investors in the Series A round include Nordstar, Better Capital and angel investors such as Dailyhunt’s Virendra Gupta, Udaan’s Sujeet Kumar, Manipal Group’s Ranjan Pai and BharatPe’s Suhail Sameer among others.GOAT is modelled around US-based Thrasio, a three-year-old upstart valued at $3 billion with $500 million in revenue and $100 million in profit. It plans to acquire online sellers from Flipkart and Amazon who have shown early traction and helps them use GOAT’s brand, technology and operational expertise.“Through this venture, we are bringing together passionate entrepreneurs, their D2C brands, marquee investors, industry experts and a dynamic team, who believe in the philosophy of partnering and nurturing. We want these brands to have access to the best resources so that they scale rapidly to become G.O.A.Ts,” Vasudev said.G.O.A.T said it is in advanced discussions with at least 10 brands for acquisition and is looking for brands in fashion, beauty, personal care, and home and kitchen spaces.These so-called Thrasio models are collectively raising $300 million across nearly a dozen startups, all with the identical pitch, a phenomenon that was virtually never seen before in Indian startups. Other well-funded players include Mensa Brands, GlobalBees and 10Club.“At Flipkart, we are consistently focused on identifying opportunities and building new partnerships that benefit the ecosystem at large.

Why Byju's is betting big on the upskilling space,26 July,"Byju's, India's most valued private internet company, on July 26 said it has acquired upskilling platform Great Learning for $600 million and that it will invest $400 million more in this segment, as it looks to expand its education services globally across categories. The acquisition is the latest step by Byju Raveendran, its billionaire founder and CEO, towards taking Byju’s public in the next 12-18 months. Byju’s is open to listing in India or the US or both, Raveendran told Moneycontrol in an interview.The cash and stock deal, with some future payout planned too, is Byju's fourth acquisition this year and will help expand its offerings beyond the K12 (kindergarten to 12th grade) and test prep segments into the professional upskilling space, where firms like Eruditus and UpGrad are building sizeable businesses too.""This will enable us to enter a new space that has very high potential in terms of the opportunity. It is a highly competitive space but they have been able to create something that is very efficient,"" Raveendran said. ​Great Learning has tied up with institutions such as Stanford University, MIT, National University Singapore, IIT Bombay, and Great Lakes Institute of Management to offer programs in areas such as Business Analytics, Data Science, Machine Learning, Cyber Security, and Digital Marketing. It offers these programs in both classroom and online mode and claims to have impacted over 1.5 million professionals and students from 170 countries, with a completion rate of over 90%. Founded in 2013 by Mohan Lakhamraju, the former India head of hedge fund Tiger Global, Hari Krishnan Nair, and Arjun Nair, Great Learning is boot-strapped and has crossed a revenue run rate of $100 million in FY21. It will continue to operate as an independent unit under the Byju's Group, with its founding team staying on. Other Indian ed-tech companies that target this segment include Eruditus, Simplilearn, and Upgrad. Eruditus and Byju's both count Sequoia and other investors in common. Great Learning is the latest in a spree of acquisitions that Byju's has made in the last year, as it looks to consolidate its leadership in the online and offline learning space across categories and different geographies.It comes a week after Byju's acquired US-based reading platform Epic for $500 million, as part of which it also announced a $1 billion investment in North America, supposedly one of its biggest markets. Its other US-focussed acquisitions include educational games maker Osmo and coding startup WhiteHat Jr. It recently launched Future School, an online one-on-one live learning platform for math and coding aimed at countries such as the US, UK, Brazil, Mexico, and Indonesia. Byju's extended shopping spree has prompted shock, awe, and even memes on the lengths that Byju's will go to cement its leadership. Social media users for example joked if Byju's will now start buying government-run national boards of education and if it's India's answer to Thrasio- with its formidable house of brands. ""The fact that it is a meme means I don't need to have a reaction. The education space is still under-invested"", he said Byju's acquisitions are also in lockstep with an ongoing fundraising round, which could end up at $1.25 billion. As part of this, it recently raised $350 million from UBS, Blackstone, ADQ, Phoenix Rising & Zoom founder Eric Yuan, at a valuation of $16.5 Billion, making it India's most valuable unicorn. According to data from CB Insights, Byju's is now the 11th most valuable startup in the world. Its revenue doubled in the pandemic year as more students relied on online classes and stood at Rs 5,600 crore for the year ended March 2021. The investor appetite in Byju's comes amid a funding boom in the Indian startup ecosystem and a rush of Internet IPOs. While Zomato's public listing received an overwhelming response, other unicorns that plan to list in India this year include Paytm, PolicyBazaar, Nykaa, and Delhivery.""It is good to see investors valuing growth. But our timelines are not based on others. We are open to listing in India or the US and will evaluate it in 12-18 months,"" he said. Raveendran also sees opportunities for Indian edtech startups open up further given the crackdown by Chinese regulators on their native edtech companies. The Chinese government said these venture-funded education firms should be treated as not-for-profit firms, and the private ones will not be able to list. The listed techs saw their stock prices crash over 70%, sounding a death-knell to an active sector.""I still believe these companies are the reason why China became a force. This might turn out to be an advantage for India, as more investors might come here,” Raveendran said.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/startup/byjus-acquires-great-learning-for-600-million-enters-upskilling-space-7224461.html,Funding,"Byju’s is open to listing in India or the US or both, Raveendran told Moneycontrol in an interview.The cash and stock deal, with some future payout planned too, is Byju's fourth acquisition this year and will help expand its offerings beyond the K12 (kindergarten to 12th grade) and test prep segments into the professional upskilling space, where firms like Eruditus and UpGrad are building sizeable businesses too.Great Learning is the latest in a spree of acquisitions that Byju's has made in the last year, as it looks to consolidate its leadership in the online and offline learning space across categories and different geographies.It comes a week after Byju's acquired US-based reading platform Epic for $500 million, as part of which it also announced a $1 billion investment in North America, supposedly one of its biggest markets.","['Byju’s', 'Moneycontrol', 'Eruditus', 'UpGrad', 'Great Learning', 'Epic']","['$600 million', '$400 million', '$100 million', '$500 million', '$1 billion', '$1.25 billion', '$350 million', '$16.5 Billion']"
"Mamaearth raises $50 million led by Sofina, valued at $730 million",26 July,"Baby and skincare products startup Mamaearth said on July 26 that it had raised $50 million in a funding round led by Belgian investor Sofina Ventures, valuing it at $730 million.This is more than double the $300 million it was valued at nine months ago, which Moneycontrol first wrote about.Mamaearth’s early investors Fireside Ventures, Stellaris Venture Partners, Sharp Ventures and Titan Capital also sold a portion of their stake in the round.Founded in 2016 by husband-wife duo Varun and Ghazal Alagh, Mamaearth has emerged as one of the hottest new-age consumer brands in India, riding the so called direct-to-consumer wave, where brands sell to consumers directly from their website or via ecommerce platforms, rather than going the traditional and expensive offline route.It offers more than 80 toxin-free, natural products, including bamboo-based baby wipes, face masks, lotions, and hair care products. It also launched a second brand, Derma Co, late last year.""This round will help amplify the process and strengthen the D2C and offline expansion of Mamaearth, along with further accelerating the growth of The Derma Co., which is already showing early signs of success since its launch in 2020,” said Varun Alagh, co-founder and CEO of MamaearthAccording to reports, direct-to-consumer (D2C) brands could be worth $100 billion in the next five to seven years as the pandemic gave way for consumers to buy online. D2C brands directly start by selling their products online and are assisted by other e-commerce marketplaces such as Flipkart, Myntra, and Amazon. Sectors most lucrative for D2C brands include beauty and personal care, food and beverage (F&B) and fashion. A high growth in the millennial population and a shift in dietary preferences towards organic and plant-based products have led to F&B brands using D2C globally.""Mamaearth has an audacious goal of disrupting the $25B personal care industry by using technology across the three key pillars of FMCG – product, marketing, and distribution. They have established themselves as a clear market leader in the digital-first brands' space by providing consumers a refreshing bouquet of toxin-free products,” said Ishaan Mittal, Principal at Sequoia India.While having built a sizable online presence, Mamaearth will also use the money raised to expand offline. Consumer brands often start out online and then expand offline because despite the internet’s potential and growth, the overwhelming majority of Indian retail is still offline.Mamaearth did not disclose its exact revenue but said it has a revenue run rate of over Rs 500 crore- or about Rs 42 crore a monthMamaearth plans to become a house of brands and will use the money for acquisitions as well. The strategy is similar to so-called Thrasio models, which have been increasingly popular in India recently. One of them, GlobalBees, even raised India’s largest ever Series A round of $150 million.

Zomato IPO: Early investor Sequoia talks about the food delivery giant’s origins and X-factor,23 July,"In 2006, when Deepinder Goyal decided to upload the menu from consultancy firm Bain’s cafeteria to the company’s intranet to deal with the long lunchtime queues, no one could have known that it would be the start of a long, arduous journey leading up to a historic public offering for food delivery company Zomato, one that valued it at over $10 billion.In a blog post, Mohit Bhatnagar, managing director of Sequoia India and a board member of Zomato for eight years, spoke about the startup’s early days, why Sequoia invested in it and what makes Zomato exciting.“I first met Deepinder in July 2013, one day before a trip to the US to meet clients to support a fundraise. Sanjeev Bikhchandani, the founder of Info Edge and an early investor in Zomato, had suggested I meet the company; downloads of their restaurant discovery app were growing. We pulled up to the Zomato farmhouse, which is set on a large, grassy acreage on the outskirts of Delhi, at 8 am the next morning (Read all about that interesting first interaction here).The first thing I noticed was a blazing red punching bag hanging on the front porch. It set the tone for the journey we all took together over the subsequent years; aggressive, sometimes bruising – but always building new muscles, while working super hard, to eventually create a resilient and enduring company. The farmhouse is a treasure trove of Zomato memories.Read | Zomato listing: Food delivery giant crosses Rs 1 lakh crore m-cap after stellar debutDeepi served up hot coffee and an ambitious slide deck that talked about how Zomato was going to rule the global restaurant discovery world by creating something they called a vertical social network! The business was young ($400k in revenue) and was predominantly built on web traffic, driven by a large in-house content team and there were more iOS users than android. Still, two things stood out in that meeting:First, the business was growing quickly on word-of-mouth and organic traffic, with zero marketing. Customers were loving the product.Second, a refreshing and audacious vision to win globally, at a time when few Indian startup founders were looking beyond their borders.I cancelled my US trip right away and requested for a special Sequoia India meeting on the next day, which was a weekend. I figured I was serving our clients better by staying back to partner with a company led by someone who was arguably India’s best product entrepreneur. In November 2013, Sequoia Capital India led Zomato’s $35 million Series A round, making it one of Sequoia Capital India’s largest investments at that point in time.”Moneycontrol also wrote about the transaction recently while tracing Zomato’s origins, pivots and comebacks. Back then for Sequoia, Zomato, a listings platform, becoming a $500 million company would have been a good outcome Mind you, this was when Flipkart and InMobi were India’s only unicorns, businesses valued at $1 billion or more.A few months after the investment, Bhatnagar walked into Zomato’s farmhouse to find a poster that said: “Zomato is Going to Eat Yelp’s Lunch.”“Yelp, which pioneered restaurant discovery, had a $4 billion market capitalisation at the time. That didn’t intimidate Zomato, which had just acquired Urbanspoon in the US as an entry into the US and Canadian markets,” Bhatnagar wrote.The Urbanspoon acquisition didn’t work out, but its ambition showed Sequoia that it was willing to take risks as long as there was a chance of winning.“Many people later misread their bravado as arrogance. But it’s actually part of the company’s culture and DNA to put a stake in the ground by announcing their most audacious goals. Massive ambition is core to their being. This includes Zomato’s early decision to expand into global markets; to complement its high-margin classifieds business model by aggressively gaining market share in the food delivery market; its subsequent decision to shut down many international markets to focus on India; to get into new initiatives like Zomato Gold (Pro), payments and Hyperpure; to acquire Uber Eats in India. And to publish an annual report with all transparency years before they went public. Swift and courageous decision-making is a trait that deeply resonates within the company,” Bhatnagar wrote. This is Zomato’s X-factor, he added.Even as it expanded, food was Zomato’s focus, as opposed to logistics.“This clear vision took Zomato down a different road to other food discovery and delivery companies in India, the US, China. Many industry players look at the business through the lens of logistics and have made last-mile delivery utilisation their key metric, thereby branching into many categories like medicine delivery and courier services. Zomato’s founding team made a conscious decision to stay focused on ‘meals consumed’ at the core of their DNA,” Bhatnagar said.When Zomato started food delivery, many people were unconvinced about whether it could make money and build a sustainable business.“The decision to keep food at the core of Zomato’s DNA changed the company’s trajectory as it embraced food delivery,” Bhatnagar said.“In their recent annual report, Zomato reported their contribution margin went from -47 rupees per order in Q1 FY20 to +27 rupees per order in Q1 FY21. The underlying unit economics continued to strengthen because the fast-growing base of repeat customers changed their behaviour and ordered more frequently; not only did people order more frequently, but their order sizes went up; (and) the Zomato product team innovated and iterated furiously to bring in efficiencies in the last mile of Zomato’s delivery operations,” he added.Read | Zomato's Deepinder Goyal: Jio’s prolific growth has set us up for unprecedented scale, not altering course for short-term profitsBhatnagar also pointed out Zomato’s social and diversity initiatives, ensuring women make up 50 percent of its board; they provide 26 weeks of paid parental leave to both men and women, and period leave to female employees. Feeding India, Zomato’s not-for-profit foundation, has served over 123 million meals to people in underserved communities in India.“On behalf of everyone at Sequoia India, I’d like to congratulate Deepinder, his leadership team and all the ‘Zomans’ who have their fingerprints on the journey from idea to IPO. One of the most common phrases used at Zomato is: “1% done.” So while today’s event is an important milestone, I’m sure the team is already cooking up the next disruption to reshape the future of food,” he wrote.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/zomato-ipo-listing-early-investor-sequoia-story-origins-x-factor-deepinder-goyal-7212591.html,Funding,"In 2006, when Deepinder Goyal decided to upload the menu from consultancy firm Bain’s cafeteria to the company’s intranet to deal with the long lunchtime queues, no one could have known that it would be the start of a long, arduous journey leading up to a historic public offering for food delivery company Zomato, one that valued it at over $10 billion.In a blog post, Mohit Bhatnagar, managing director of Sequoia India and a board member of Zomato for eight years, spoke about the startup’s early days, why Sequoia invested in it and what makes Zomato exciting.“I first met Deepinder in July 2013, one day before a trip to the US to meet clients to support a fundraise.The underlying unit economics continued to strengthen because the fast-growing base of repeat customers changed their behaviour and ordered more frequently; not only did people order more frequently, but their order sizes went up; (and) the Zomato product team innovated and iterated furiously to bring in efficiencies in the last mile of Zomato’s delivery operations,” he added.Read | Zomato's Deepinder Goyal: Jio’s prolific growth has set us up for unprecedented scale, not altering course for short-term profitsBhatnagar also pointed out Zomato’s social and diversity initiatives, ensuring women make up 50 percent of its board; they provide 26 weeks of paid parental leave to both men and women, and period leave to female employees.","['Bain', 'Zomato', 'Sequoia India', 'Zomato', 'Sequoia', 'Zomato']","['over $10 billion', '400k', '$35 million', '$500 million', '$1 billion', '$4 billion']"
"Zoom meets at night, 46 weekend calls: FOMO drives VCs to faster deals",23 July,"On July 16, Anar, a networking platform for business owners, had investors ready to invest $600,000 in an ongoing funding round. Anar was looking for more, but its pitch had not quite caught fire with investors.A day later, its CEO Nishank Jain spoke to Elevation Capital, which was extremely interested and committed $2-3 million immediately. He also spoke to Accel, another top VC firm, which decided to join the round.On July 18 (Sunday), Anar was on its way to close a $6 million seed funding round – 10 times what it had been offered less than 48 hours earlier – led by Accel and Elevation. Over the weekend, the investors spoke to the founders, carried out reference checks, issued a term sheet – a non-binding agreement with terms of investment – and conducted due diligence. The deal is expected to close soon.Elevation, formerly SAIF Partners, made 46 calls to Anar’s customers through the weekend as part of the due diligence, said two people involved in the negotiations. Anar declined to comment on the funding.In calmer times, top venture capital firms would often prefer to track a company for a few months, talk to multiple companies in a sector and then pick which one to invest in. The current funding boom, however, doesn’t allow such luxuries.Top VC firms, which in any case get access to the best deals by virtue of their fund sizes and global reputation, are under more pressure than ever before to close deals quickly for fear of having the opportunity stolen from under their nose by a competing investor.‘Market is crazy’VC firms are starting and finishing deals over weekends and getting on to Zoom at 11.30 pm on a Saturday to thrash out deal terms, further exacerbating risk in an asset class known for its risk. VCs generally avoid FOMO (fear of missing out) investing – today’s hot startup could be tomorrow’s burning mess – but this seems harder when startups are flush with cash and more money than ever is chasing relatively few of them.“The market is crazy – there’s no doubt about it. And there’s definitely some FOMO in the market,” said Gagan Goyal, a partner at India Quotient, an early-stage investor.The startup ecosystem is currently like a house party with alcohol flowing freely, a founder told Moneycontrol in March. For their investors, however, the situation is more complicated.Many investors have seen their portfolio companies receive more money at generous valuations, making their own holdings much more valuable. But the current deal-making frenzy is forcing VCs to be faster and nimbler, even though such breakneck speeds make exacerbate a risky environment, as investors may put in money without total conviction and without complete information about the company and its founders.Elevation Capital, an early backer of Paytm, Swiggy, UrbanClap and Meesho, among others, is deliberately working on closing deals and making decisions faster. Investors and founders who have worked with them say that the firm’s risk-taking ability has gone up significantly.Entry valuationLast month, Elevation and Sequoia led a $38 million Series A round in FamPay, a banking startup for teenagers. It was one of the largest Series A rounds in India’s startup history, at a valuation of $150-170 million for a company yet to make any revenue.“Was the deal expensive? Yes. But Elevation invested because they think the founders are two years ahead of anyone else in the market. And at such an early stage, you’re predicting a multi-billion dollar outcome, so the entry valuation matters less,” said a person close to the firm, requesting anonymity.Mukul Arora, a partner at Elevation, acknowledged the shift.“We are definitely faster than ever because we have evolved with the market and consciously pushed the envelope. We are customer (founder) obsessed, just like we want our portfolio founders to be,” he said.In another case, on December 25, 2020, many founders, VCs and others were on a well-deserved break after the first wave of COVID-19 had abated. Yet, partners at Sequoia India and Accel were busy finalising terms to invest in Powerplay, a software platform for the construction industry.“They need not have shown that kind of hustle in a normal market. You’ve had the first conversation, you can pick it up after the holidays. They knew it is a market where you have to move super-fast,” said a person who was aware of the discussions, requesting anonymity. The $5.2 million round was announced earlier this month.Angel investmentsVC firms are also increasingly enquiring about their portfolio founders’ angel investments, which are made in very early-stage startups in their personal capacity. They don’t want to miss out on seeing a single company.Smaller VC firms are also pushing their young analysts to source investments, beyond their core jobs of due diligence and portfolio support. Large VCs already do this.“Some investors are jumping on every deal they get and even $25 million rounds are getting closed super-fast,” said India Quotient’s Goyal.The speed of deal-making has increased also because founders and investors can do back-to-back video calls from home during the pandemic, often going up to 7-10 in a day. Before the pandemic, physical meetings were the norm, and because both sides wanted the comfort of in-person discussions, which take time to set up, deal talks would sometimes drag on.Earlier, investors would do three calls with a founder before issuing a term sheet. They may still do three calls, but in a shorter span. Three calls that would happen over a week or two now take place over a weekend, investors said.Quality outweighs risksInvestors are aware of the risks of fighting tooth-and-nail and cutting cheques in a few days, but don’t see another way out because they feel the quality of companies outweighs short-term valuation risks. However, boom markets typically end up being less lucrative periods for venture funds, as summarised by a tweet from Abhay Pandey, general partner at A91 Partners, a growth-stage investor.“Will failure rates be higher from this cohort? Very likely. But I am sure massive companies will also get built from this cohort, which will be a net positive for the ecosystem,” said Elevation’s Arora.Failure rates could be higher for a number of reasons – companies raising more money than needed and losing discipline, founders and investors not getting along and market sizes being overestimated, among others.Although early-stage VCs are investing faster than ever, when their companies look to raise their next round, they suggest that the founders take more time to evaluate a prospective investor, Arora said.“This is a 7-10 year relationship and getting stuck with the wrong partner can be painful for the company,” he added.Reference checksInvestors are counting more on founder reference checks. Early-stage VCs contend that the young companies they back have only so much data and numbers to comb through.While a VC would earlier make one or two cursory calls to check the founder’s background, this has increased to 4-5 in some cases. This helps not only to check the founder’s ethics but also his execution capabilities, experience and ability to spot talent, among other things.Not all VCs are as worried about momentum, though. While everyone is surprised, some attribute it to a demand-supply mismatch (lots of money chasing relatively fewer founders) and expect things to normalise.“These crazy booms happen now and then. I’m not too worried. It will cool off in six months,” said a partner at a $100 million early-stage fund, requesting anonymity.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/startup/sunday-night-zoom-calls-and-46-calls-on-a-weekend-vcs-face-pressure-to-close-deals-faster-7210331.html,Funding,"The current funding boom, however, doesn’t allow such luxuries.Top VC firms, which in any case get access to the best deals by virtue of their fund sizes and global reputation, are under more pressure than ever before to close deals quickly for fear of having the opportunity stolen from under their nose by a competing investor.‘Market is crazy’VC firms are starting and finishing deals over weekends and getting on to Zoom at 11.30 pm on a Saturday to thrash out deal terms, further exacerbating risk in an asset class known for its risk.But I am sure massive companies will also get built from this cohort, which will be a net positive for the ecosystem,” said Elevation’s Arora.Failure rates could be higher for a number of reasons – companies raising more money than needed and losing discipline, founders and investors not getting along and market sizes being overestimated, among others.Although early-stage VCs are investing faster than ever, when their companies look to raise their next round, they suggest that the founders take more time to evaluate a prospective investor, Arora said.“This is a 7-10 year relationship and getting stuck with the wrong partner can be painful for the company,” he added.Reference checksInvestors are counting more on founder reference checks.",[],"['600,000', '$6 million', '$38 million', '150', 'multi-billion dollar', '$5.2 million', '$25 million', '$100 million']"
Byju’s acquires US-based reading startup Epic for $500m,21 July,"Byju’s, India’s most valued internet company, said on July 21 it has acquired US-based reading platform Epic for $500 million, continuing its spree of large acquisitions to expand its education services beyond the Indian market and across categories.Epic is built on a collection of over 40,000 popular, high-quality books from 250 of the world’s best publishers. Its recommendations are customised to the child’s interests and parents can track progress and see the time spent in reading. It also has original stories which will appeal to kids. The cash and stock breakup of the deal was not specified.“Epic’s model for inspiring the next generation through interactive reading is in lockstep with our mission to help millions of children become life-long learners,” said Anita Kishore, Chief Strategy Officer, Byju’s.Byju’s said it will invest a billion dollars in North America and considers the region one of its most lucrative markets. This is not Byju’s first foray into the US. In 2019 it acquired educational games-maker Osmo, another US-based firm for $120 million.Last year Byju’s also acquired coding startup WhiteHat Jr., which also considers the US a key market. Byju’s last month launched Future School, an online one-on-one live learning platform for math and coding. Future School is led by Karan Bajaj, founder and CEO of WhiteHat Jr.“We created Epic to make quality books more accessible to kids everywhere, and to build a safe place for them to discover the joy and magic of reading in their own way...Together (with Byju’s), we can help empower future generations of kids by fostering a lifetime love for reading and learning,” said Suren Markosian, CEO and co-founder of Epic.Large acquisitions have become the bedrock of Byju’s, which was valued at $16.5 billion last month, raising $350 million from UBS, private equity giant Blackstone, Abu Dhabi state fund ADQ, Phoenix Rising and video conference firm Zoom's founder Eric Yuan. The deal made Byju’s India’s most valuable internet firm ahead of fintech company Paytm.In the last year, Byju’s has made acquisitions worth over $2 billion, including offline test prep firm Aakash, WhiteHat Jr., smaller K12-rival Toppr, GradeUp and Great Learning among others. Some of these deals have been reported by other publications and not all of them have been announced yet.“Reading fluency is fundamental for academic development because problems with this skill can interfere with a student’s ability to learn other subjects as they make their way through later grades,” Byju’s statement said.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/startup/byjus-acquires-us-based-reading-startup-epic-for-500m-7202091.html,Funding,"The cash and stock breakup of the deal was not specified.“Epic’s model for inspiring the next generation through interactive reading is in lockstep with our mission to help millions of children become life-long learners,” said Anita Kishore, Chief Strategy Officer, Byju’s.Byju’s said it will invest a billion dollars in North America and considers the region one of its most lucrative markets.Future School is led by Karan Bajaj, founder and CEO of WhiteHat Jr.“We created Epic to make quality books more accessible to kids everywhere, and to build a safe place for them to discover the joy and magic of reading in their own way...Together (with Byju’s), we can help empower future generations of kids by fostering a lifetime love for reading and learning,” said Suren Markosian, CEO and co-founder of Epic.Large acquisitions have become the bedrock of Byju’s, which was valued at $16.5 billion last month, raising $350 million from UBS, private equity giant Blackstone, Abu Dhabi state fund ADQ, Phoenix Rising and video conference firm Zoom's founder Eric Yuan.","['Byju’s', 'Byju’s', 'Future School', 'WhiteHat Jr.', 'Byju’s', 'Epic', 'Byju’s', 'UBS', 'Blackstone', 'Abu Dhabi', 'ADQ', 'Phoenix Rising', 'Zoom']","['$500 million', 'a billion dollars', '$120 million', '$16.5 billion', '$350 million', 'over $2 billion']"
Tiger Global's aggression and the 5 stages of startup grief,20 July,"Denial, anger, bargaining, depression and finally acceptance are the five leading emotions when we deal with loss. Each of them bog us down, push, pull, motivate and shape us. But these stages of grief, defined by Swiss American psychiatrist Elisabeth Kübler-Ross in 1969 found a new, strange parallel recently.Venture capitalists, private equity funds and late stage technology funds who have either lost deals to Tiger Global Management, or are simply trying to understand its strategy have seen their emotions shift in a similar trajectory the last six months.DenialIn February 2021, the New York-based investment firm led a $100 million round in construction materials marketplace Infra.Market, valuing it at a billion dollars. It was a hotly contested deal, and not a single new investor could come in,because Tiger was sitting perched in Infra.Market since its Series A round in 2019, and simply doubled down on its bet. The valuation surprised many investors. Other investors eyeing the deal had pegged a valuation of $700 million internally, and that was their upper range. “I really wanted to do the deal, but at not more than $500 million (valuation). No way I’m investing at a billion (dollars)” said a partner at a global technology fund, requesting anonymity.In July, Moneycontrol exclusively reported that Tiger is investing another $125 million, this time at a valuation of $2.6 billion. By now, the deal was almost passé. Investors, founders and bankers close to the firm say it is “just another Tiger deal,”. In the intervening four months, the startup and venture ecosystem in India has gone through the stages resembling grief- first dismissing it (Tiger’s momentum) as crazy, then growing intrigued by it, then rethinking their own strategies in light of Tiger’s dealmaking spree, and finally settling in for the new normal.Some funds have held internal meetings where Tiger’s strategy, or seemingly the lack of one- has dominated discussions. These funds have discussed Tiger’s strategy with their own backers- Limited Partners (LPs) and how it would affect their fundraising and investments.No one can replicate a $10 billion fund’s strategy. This strategy, however, is upending startup investing as we know it, and its consequences, similar to SoftBank’s rise, fall and rise again, will play out in the next few years.Tiger did not respond to a detailed query from Moneycontrol.Meet Tiger 2.0 (or 3.0?)Tiger has invested in 28 Indian internet companies this year, deploying over $1.4 billion, across stages, from Series A to pre-IPO rounds, as per data from Venture Intelligence. Tiger seems to have something for everyone. That something is called valuation.The examples are dime-a-dozen but one stands out. When investing app Groww was raising funds earlier this year, investors were offering it a valuation of about $500 million, doubling in six months. Tiger could have offered a valuation of $600-700 million and won the deal. It invested $83 million at billion dollar valuation, catapulting Groww to unicorn status- private firms valued at a billion dollars or more. This, with Groww’s revenue still being miles behind its valuation and not having seen how a bear market will affect retail investing trends.“Tiger is playing a game at a different level. A few hundred million more in valuation, for one deal out of 100, for $100 million in a $10 billion fund, simply doesn’t matter,” said a person who has worked with Tiger on deals. “They want to get into all the best startup deals in India. Everything else is negotiable,” this person adds.This also means Tiger makes competing investments, generally a strict no-no in venture capital. It is an investor in three investment apps- Groww, Upstox and INDWealth; three online education firms- Byju’s, Unacademy and Vedantu and two fantasy gaming companies- Dream11 and My11 Circle.Tiger has been a key startup investor in India for at least the last decade. Lee Fixel, its erstwhile head honcho was known to close deals in a few phone calls, back founders to the hilt, and is a big reason for Flipkart’s growth and success- India’s new economy startup pioneer. Fixel, however, left the firm in 2019, to start his own firm- Addition.Scott Shleifer, who has been leading the firm ever since, invests even faster than Fixel, founders say. “Shleifer avoids getting bogged down in details and can turn on a salesman’s charm to close deals...Shleifer looks at “how the world fits into something—he puts the overall thesis on top of stuff,” says a report from The Information.Compared to Fixel, Shleifer seems to have a more macro approach, and although he comes well-prepared to meetings with founders, he is not as entrenched as Fixel was with Flipkart, or to a lesser extent, Ola. Fixel virtually bet his entire career on the online retailer, and fortunately it paid off. Even though Shleifer’s Tiger may invest more in India than Fixel’s Tiger did, Shleifer decidedly broad-bases his bets, said people who have spoken to him.BargainingTiger’s dealmaking frenzy has taken the venture industry by storm. Because of its multi-stage strategy, Tiger can be a friend and a threat to a VC at the same time. It has given early stage VCs attractive markups on their investments that arguably no other investor would, but it has also beaten VCs to deals, and invested in companies when VCs have told founders that they are better off not fundraising at that moment.One partner at a $300 million venture firm recently advised a founder in his portfolio that he shouldn’t raise money from anyone, especially not Tiger, because its attractive valuation terms are a double edged sword.“You will get the valuation of your dreams, and which no other investor will give. The pressure is on you to justify that valuation. If you don’t raise money now and focus on the business, you can raise next year once your metrics are better proven,” the investor told the founder. The founder raised about $20-25 million from Tiger anyway, confident of his execution capabilities.But Tiger’s famed speed, large cheques and aggressive valuations should not be seen as signs of an investor who doesn’t know what it's doing. Far from it. This strategy, in various forms, has proven itself over and over again.“They come in having done a lot of research and have a strong thesis. So you don’t have to spend time educating them, which is great,” says Abhishek Poddar, co-founder and CEO of Plum Insurance, a one-year-old startup which raised a $16.5 million Series A round led by Tiger in May.“They have a lot of conviction, which is why they can move fast,” he adds.Tiger does extensive research on the sectors it invests in, builds a thesis, does background checks on founders and only then has the first conversation with a founder, people who worked with the firm say. It regularly works with management consultancy giant Bain and Co., which conducts due diligence on behalf of Tiger, and works with its portfolio companies after investment to help analyse new markets, study competition and configure internal strategy. It’s like having an on-demand chief of strategy, something many early startups typically cannot afford, said one early stage founder, requesting anonymity.Tiger does not invest in every space either, although it may not seem that way. For example, it is yet to back a lending marketplace startup in India. As of last year, Shleifer was not convinced that Indian startups can lend profitably without needing a license, and if they do get a license, whether these firms have technology that will set them apart from the hoi-polloi of lenders in India, said two people who have spoken to Shleifer on the subject. They did not want to be named.Tiger is betting on a market, and not always on a company. Its bets are on the India education market, cloud software market or social media market first, and on a specific company second, if at all.Not all of Tiger’s high-flying bets will work. They never do. But they don’t need to. From its 2015 deals, ecommerce firm ShopClues, accommodation platform Zostel and classifieds portal Quikr among others did not work out. But, Flipkart, software firm Freshworks, payments firm Razorpay and ride hailing firm Ola did. Tiger made $4 billion on a $1.5 billion investment in Flipkart, at a time when investors struggled for exits far more than right now. Freshworks- which Tiger entered at $500 million, is eyeing a public offering at $10 billion, while Razorpay is currently valued at $3 billion.Similarly in 2019, Tiger invested in a dozen business-to-business and software startups. From that cohort, Zenoti and Chargebee- both unicorns- may end up overshadowing whatever happens to the rest of that cohort.AcceptanceEarly stage VCs are gradually making their peace with Tiger’s ins and outs, its inconsistent but always impactful dealmaking and where that leaves the industry.Tiger’s investments are also astonishing at first look because they are viewed from a traditional venture capital lens, which work on very specific models planned for very specific outcomes (with inherent risk factored in). Tiger seems to be investing with the DNA of a stock market investor, but the risk-taking ability of a VC.It isn’t too fussed on price (valuations), is happy to stay invested even after companies go public, and most importantly, is rather detached from company fortunes compared to typical VCs- who often fancy themselves as operators and consider their operational inputs a key part of what they bring to a startup.“Tiger is very clear that funding this round doesn’t mean they will fund your next round. VCs and PEs often promise companies that they will back you even in your hard times, and that is what makes them a partner, not just an investor. Tiger makes no such promises,” said an investor who has worked with the firm. He did not want to be named.The public market lens to private investing could have an interesting endgame- a listed exchange traded fund- consisting of stocks across various technology sub-sectors.“If you carefully see, Tiger’s portfolio is a comprehensive Unlisted India Tech Index which covers Fintech, SaaS, Consumer Internet. Their portfolio has companies at various maturity stages starting from early stage growth to mid growth to late stage,” says Ashish Dave, CEO of Mirae Asset Venture Investments India.“Apart from picking winners, they are picking spaces. They can spin it out and also list it as an ETF someday. To some global pools of capital, it could be appealing,” he adds.Tiger is trying to change the rules of the game, or play an entirely different game, depending on how you look at it. The last time an investor tried this, Masayoshi Son-led SoftBank raised a record $100 billion Vision Fund. It seemed to misfire with WeWork’s IPO downfall and Uber’s tepid listing, but Coupang’s bumper listing and other deals have SoftBank cheering once again.Investors often compare the current funding boom to 2015, the first real startup funding boom India saw. Tiger and SoftBank were the big players then too. What is different is that India’s internet user-base has expanded, entrepreneurs are more experienced and investors have seen more boom-and-bust cycles.At current pace, Tiger is raising $3-6 billion every year for public and private investments, leaning more towards private technology deals. Investors say that in six months or so, its India dealmaking mania should slow down. Where individual companies will stand then, and how many of them can still justify the rich valuations may determine the success of Tiger’s strategy and the viability of this style of deal-making",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/tiger-globals-aggression-and-the-5-stages-of-startup-grief-7193461.html,Funding,"So you don’t have to spend time educating them, which is great,” says Abhishek Poddar, co-founder and CEO of Plum Insurance, a one-year-old startup which raised a $16.5 million Series A round led by Tiger in May.“They have a lot of conviction, which is why they can move fast,” he adds.Tiger does extensive research on the sectors it invests in, builds a thesis, does background checks on founders and only then has the first conversation with a founder, people who worked with the firm say.Tiger seems to be investing with the DNA of a stock market investor, but the risk-taking ability of a VC.It isn’t too fussed on price (valuations), is happy to stay invested even after companies go public, and most importantly, is rather detached from company fortunes compared to typical VCs- who often fancy themselves as operators and consider their operational inputs a key part of what they bring to a startup.“Tiger is very clear that funding this round doesn’t mean they will fund your next round.",['Plum Insurance'],"['$100 million', 'a billion dollars', '$700 million', 'more than $500 million', 'a billion (dollars', '$125 million', '$2.6 billion', '$10 billion', 'over $1.4 billion', 'about $500 million', '600', '$83 million', 'billion dollar', 'a billion dollars', '$100 million', '$10 billion', '$300 million', 'about $20-25 million', '$16.5 million', '$4 billion', '$1.5 billion', '$500 million', '$10 billion', '$3 billion', 'a record $100 billion Vision Fund', '$3-6 billion']"

"SEBI justifies intervention in PNB Housing-Carlyle deal, citing need for independent valuation",16 July,"India’s market regulator defended its decision to intervene in the PNB Housing case before the company’s extraordinary general meeting, saying it was necessary for shareholders to get the correct valuation at which investors led by the Carlyle Group would acquire shares and management control.Concluding its arguments before the Securities Appellate Tribunal on Friday, the Securities and Exchange Board of India said PNB Housing should have got an independent valuation report prepared and acted on that, as prescribed by the company’s articles of association.The SAT will next hear the matter on July 19.SEBI maintained that the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Issue of Capital and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2018, (ICDR Regulations) provided for a floor price below which shares cannot be issued, but that level could not be construed as a price ceiling.The regulator said the board of PNB Housing had violated the articles of association and SEBI was bound to intervene in the matter before the EGM took place. PNB Housing should have ensured that an independent valuation report would be presented to shareholders so that they could decide whether to approve the proposed deal.SEBI also raised concerns over a valuation report that was prepared by the partner of the company’s statutory auditor, with the regulator’s counsel saying that a certified valuer submitting a report in a day was a matter of serious concern.A legal expert said the SAT was rightly troubled by the timing of the letter sent by SEBI, just before the EGM, but the regulator could not have stood by without taking any action.“It (the SAT) is equally concerned by the fact that SEBI didn’t wait for the general body of shareholders to decide and vote for themselves,” said the lawyer who specialises in securities laws, asking not to be identified. “However, SEBI is right in its own way, conceding that it would fail in its duty if it were to remain a mute spectator and not come in to protect retail shareholders who may be misguided due to lack of information.”Also Read: Complied with all regulations in Rs 4,000-crore Carlyle deal, PNB Housing tells tribunalThis account of the proceedings was pieced together from conversations with people familiar with the matter who did not want to be identified.At the previous hearing on July 13, SEBI told the appellate tribunal that the ICDR regulations do not stop with prices alone and also cover the rights of shareholders. There is no conflict between the articles of association, the ICDR regulations and the Companies Act, it said.SEBI had the right to intervene in this case because it went against the interests of minority shareholders, the regulator argued. If the articles of association had clearly prescribed an independent valuation, then why didn’t PNB Housing get it done, it had asked.A former SEBI official also defended the regulator’s intervention. “From the arguments at SAT, it appears that an impression is being created against SEBI’s action, that the regulator intervened just before the EGM and tried to stop it. If one looks at SEBI’s communication as reported, all it said was not to act on the resolution relating to preferential offer; It did not stop the EGM or shareholder voting or even declaration of result. It was SAT which prohibited declaration of result,” he told Moneycontrol on condition of anonymity.“PNB Housing has been reportedly arguing that the articles of association are outdated and have no relevance after IPO. This, once again, is a very weak argument. First, if the relevant article is existing today, it has to be complied with. But most importantly the articles were changed at the time of IPO and the article in question was retained, in all probability to protect PE investors against cheap dilution without valuation report. Therefore, it appears that what was designed to protect PE investors is coming in handy to protect minority investors,” the person pointed out.The former SEBI official observed that the ball is in SAT’s court and expressed hope that the Tribunal would not disappoint minority public shareholders. “With PNB now asking PNB HFL board to comply with the SEBI order, should there not be a new vote? Or should the proposed allottee be allowed to benefit even though the current promoter and the person in control realised the mistake? Should law support such beneficiaries?” he asked.The Carlyle dealThe case pertains to PNB Housing’s plan, approved by the board on May 31, to raise funds through a preferential allotment of shares worth Rs 3,200 crore and warrants worth Rs 800 crore to Carlyle, General Atlantic and Salisbury Investments, an entity owned by Aditya Puri, a senior advisor at the Carlyle Group and former managing director of HDFC Bank.The price of the shares and warrants was fixed at Rs 390 apiece, which was Rs 6 higher than the floor price under ICDR norms. For the warrants, 25 percent of the amount needed to be infused on the allotment and the remaining was to be paid within 18 months.Also Read: Lessons from the PNB Housing Finance fiascoAccording to proxy adviser Stakeholders Empowerment Services, the proposed transaction was unfair to the company’s public shareholders.Four days before the EGM on June 22, SEBI directed the company to stop the allotment unless the valuation was carried out by an independent valuer.The regulator, in a letter to the company dated June 18, said the proposal to issue securities and other related matters was ultra vires of the articles of association.SEBI said the proposal should not be acted upon until the company undertakes the valuation of shares as prescribed under 19 (2) of articles of association “for the purpose of preferential allotment from an independent registered valuer as per the provisions of applicable laws. The said report shall be considered by the company’s board while deciding on the preferential issue of shares and warrants.”The appellate tribunal allowed the EGM to go ahead on the condition that the voting outcome would not be disclosed until the matter was resolved.Last week, PNB Housing Finance said its promoter Punjab National Bank asked it to consider restructuring the proposed Rs 4,000 crore capital infusion deal.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/sebi-justifies-intervention-in-pnb-housing-carlyle-deal-citing-need-for-independent-valuation-7184301.html,Funding,"India’s market regulator defended its decision to intervene in the PNB Housing case before the company’s extraordinary general meeting, saying it was necessary for shareholders to get the correct valuation at which investors led by the Carlyle Group would acquire shares and management control.Concluding its arguments before the Securities Appellate Tribunal on Friday, the Securities and Exchange Board of India said PNB Housing should have got an independent valuation report prepared and acted on that, as prescribed by the company’s articles of association.The SAT will next hear the matter on July 19.SEBI maintained that the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Issue of Capital and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2018, (ICDR Regulations) provided for a floor price below which shares cannot be issued, but that level could not be construed as a price ceiling.The regulator said the board of PNB Housing had violated the articles of association and SEBI was bound to intervene in the matter before the EGM took place.For the warrants, 25 percent of the amount needed to be infused on the allotment and the remaining was to be paid within 18 months.Also Read: Lessons from the PNB Housing Finance fiascoAccording to proxy adviser Stakeholders Empowerment Services, the proposed transaction was unfair to the company’s public shareholders.Four days before the EGM on June 22, SEBI directed the company to stop the allotment unless the valuation was carried out by an independent valuer.The regulator, in a letter to the company dated June 18, said the proposal to issue securities and other related matters was ultra vires of the articles of association.SEBI said the proposal should not be acted upon until the company undertakes the valuation of shares as prescribed under 19 (2) of articles of association “for the purpose of preferential allotment from an independent registered valuer as per the provisions of applicable laws.","['PNB Housing', 'the Carlyle Group', 'the Securities Appellate Tribunal', 'the Securities and Exchange Board of India', 'PNB Housing', 'SAT', 'the Securities and Exchange Board of India', 'ICDR Regulations', 'PNB Housing', 'EGM', 'the PNB Housing Finance', 'Stakeholders Empowerment Services', 'EGM']",[]

"SEBI tells appellate tribunal it can intervene in Rs 4,000-crore Carlyle-PNB Housing Finance deal",13 July,"The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has argued that the Article of Association (AoA) was legally binding and the Companies Act empowered it to intervene in the Rs 4,000-crore fundraising deal between PNB Housing Finance and a clutch of investors led by the Carlyle Group.SEBI was presenting its side before the Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT) on July 13, after PNB Housing argued on Monday that the AoA was just a bilateral agreement.

CCI okays SoftBank investment in Swiggy,12 July,"The Competition Commission of India (CCI) has approved the investment by SoftBank Vision Fund II in food delivery platform Swiggy.Moneycontrol had reported in April that SoftBank will invest  $450-500 million in Swiggy at a post-money valuation of close to $5.5 billion.The investment from SoftBank will come on top of the $800 million series J round that Swiggy recently closed, with Falcon Edge, Amansa, Think Investments, Carmignac and Goldman Sachs at a valuation of $5 billion. Swiggy's over $1.2 billion fund raise will give it significant firepower at a time when rival Zomato is looking to hit the public markets.SoftBank's interest in the Indian food tech space is not new. For years, there has been speculation on whether it will go with Zomato or Swiggy Zomato seemed to have an edge a few years ago after it acquired UberEats, which gave SoftBank's portfolio company Uber, a stake in the merged entity. In fact, Alibaba's Ant Financial, which is another early bet of Masa Son is also an investor in Zomato.​While Zomato is focused on the food delivery segment though it recently invested $100 million in grocery delivery app Grofers, Swiggy, in addition to food delivery is also  betting big on its hyperlocal delivery service Swiggy Genie, where it competes with Dunzo, Flipkart.

Actual implementation of PMAY falls below scheduled targets: ICRA,12 July,"The actual implementation of the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojna (PMAY) has fallen below the scheduled targets and would require a substantial push going forward, an ICRA analysis has said, pointing out that the performance is also likely to get impacted in FY2022 on account of COVID-19.In terms of expenditure too, in aggregate, out of the required Rs 4.70 lakh crore, Rs 2.97 lakh crore has been incurred in the last five years but a whopping Rs 1.71 lakh crore (~37%) of the expenditure would be required to be incurred within the next 1.5 years to complete the construction of the balance units by 2022 to meet the near-term scaled down target, it noted.Under the PMAY-U, against a revised target of 11.2 million units, almost entire 11.2 million housing units has been sanctioned and 4.8 million houses have been completed, leading to the completion of only 43% of the near-term target as well as the sanctioned units under the PMAY-U.The scheme was launched in 2015, through which the government had set a target of constructing 50 million new housing units by 2022, of which 30 million units are proposed to be constructed in the rural areas (through PMAY-Rural) and 20 million in the urban areas (through PMAY-Urban).Subsequently, the government has set a scaled down near-term target of 21.4 million under PMAY-R and 11.2 million units under PMAY-U by 2022.“With 1.5 years to go, against the revised targets, 19.55 million houses have been sanctioned and 14.16 million have been completed through PMAY-Rural till April 2021, implying completion of 67% of the revised target and 72% of the sanctioned houses. Further, 9% of the houses have not been sanctioned so far,” says Kapil Banga, assistant vice president and sector head, ICRA.Under the PMAY-U, against a revised target of 11.2 million units, almost entire 11.2 million housing units has been sanctioned and 4.8 million houses have been completed, leading to the completion of only 43% of the near-term target as well as the sanctioned units under the PMAY-U. Thus, a significant pick-up in the implementation pace for both, the PMAY-U and the PMAY-R, will be required to achieve the Housing for All target by 2022, he said.In terms of funding, the allocation towards the PMAY-U in the Union Budget has been reduced to Rs 8,000 crore for FY2022, against a revised estimate (RE) of Rs 21,000 crore for FY2021 and the same has remained stagnant when compared to the budget estimate (BE) of Rs 8,000 for FY2021.The allocation towards the PMAY-R in the Union Budget has remained at Rs 21,000 crore for FY2022, the same as the revised estimate (RE) and the budget estimate (BE) for FY2021. Though the extra budgetary resources (EBR) for PMAY-R have been increased from Rs 10,000 crore to Rs 20,000 crore in BE of FY2022 against Rs 10,000 crore in FY2021; the EBR for PMAY-U for FY2022 is nil, against Rs 10,000 crore in BE of FY2021, the analysis said.Thus far, the government has allocated/committed Rs 2.72 lakh crore and incurred Rs 2.02 lakh crore (74%) out of the total estimated requirement of Rs 2.88 lakh crore for the revised targets of PMAY-R, leaving pending commitment/allocation of Rs 16,000 crore and pending expenditure of Rs 86,000 crore.Further, it has allocated/committed Rs 1.81 lakh crore and has incurred only Rs 0.95 lakh crore (53%) out of the total estimated requirement of Rs 1.81 lakh crore towards the revised targets under the PMAY-U.“Thus, in aggregate, out of the required Rs 4.70 lakh crore, Rs 2.97 lakh crore has been incurred in the last five years but a whopping Rs 1.71 lakh crore (~37%) of the expenditure would be required to be incurred within the next 1.5 years to complete the construction of the balance units by 2022 to meet the near-term scaled down target.However, in terms of expenditure trend, the actual consolidated expenditure on PMAY in FY2020 was Rs 25,000 crore, the RE for FY2021 was Rs 40,500 crore, while the aggregate budgetary allocation for FY2022 is only Rs 47,500 crore (including budgeted EBR), thus a large gap of Rs 1.24 lakh crore is required to be plugged in the next 1.5 years to meet the near-term target,” said Banga.Although the Cabinet had approved a Rs 60,000-crore dedicated affordable housing fund – the National Urban Housing Fund - in 2018 to support the PMAY programme implementation, a considerable portion of the same has already been utilised, raising the need for more allocation. In the absence of a substantial ramp-up in budgetary allocation, the execution could continue to lag, while the dependence on extra budgetary resources is likely to remain elevated.Thus, the ability to provide the required EBR to plug the gap would be critical to meet the financial spending and consequently the physical completion targets within the stated timeline. It remains to be seen what additional avenues the government will tap into to raise such financing to expedite the implementation of the scheme, the analysis said.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/real-estate/actual-implementation-of-pmay-falls-below-scheduled-targets-icra-7159281.html,Funding,"The actual implementation of the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojna (PMAY) has fallen below the scheduled targets and would require a substantial push going forward, an ICRA analysis has said, pointing out that the performance is also likely to get impacted in FY2022 on account of COVID-19.In terms of expenditure too, in aggregate, out of the required Rs 4.70 lakh crore, Rs 2.97 lakh crore has been incurred in the last five years but a whopping Rs 1.71 lakh crore (~37%) of the expenditure would be required to be incurred within the next 1.5 years to complete the construction of the balance units by 2022 to meet the near-term scaled down target, it noted.Under the PMAY-U, against a revised target of 11.2 million units, almost entire 11.2 million housing units has been sanctioned and 4.8 million houses have been completed, leading to the completion of only 43% of the near-term target as well as the sanctioned units under the PMAY-U.The scheme was launched in 2015, through which the government had set a target of constructing 50 million new housing units by 2022, of which 30 million units are proposed to be constructed in the rural areas (through PMAY-Rural) and 20 million in the urban areas (through PMAY-Urban).Subsequently, the government has set a scaled down near-term target of 21.4 million under PMAY-R and 11.2 million units under PMAY-U by 2022.“With 1.5 years to go, against the revised targets, 19.55 million houses have been sanctioned and 14.16 million have been completed through PMAY-Rural till April 2021, implying completion of 67% of the revised target and 72% of the sanctioned houses.Though the extra budgetary resources (EBR) for PMAY-R have been increased from Rs 10,000 crore to Rs 20,000 crore in BE of FY2022 against Rs 10,000 crore in FY2021; the EBR for PMAY-U for FY2022 is nil, against Rs 10,000 crore in BE of FY2021, the analysis said.Thus far, the government has allocated/committed Rs 2.72 lakh crore and incurred Rs 2.02 lakh crore (74%) out of the total estimated requirement of Rs 2.88 lakh crore for the revised targets of PMAY-R, leaving pending commitment/allocation of Rs 16,000 crore and pending expenditure of Rs 86,000 crore.Further, it has allocated/committed Rs 1.81 lakh crore and has incurred only Rs 0.95 lakh crore (53%) out of the total estimated requirement of Rs 1.81 lakh crore towards the revised targets under the PMAY-U.“Thus, in aggregate, out of the required Rs 4.70 lakh crore, Rs 2.97 lakh crore has been incurred in the last five years but a whopping Rs 1.71 lakh crore (~37%) of the expenditure would be required to be incurred within the next 1.5 years to complete the construction of the balance units by 2022 to meet the near-term scaled down target.However, in terms of expenditure trend, the actual consolidated expenditure on PMAY in FY2020 was Rs 25,000 crore, the RE for FY2021 was Rs 40,500 crore, while the aggregate budgetary allocation for FY2022 is only Rs 47,500 crore (including budgeted EBR), thus a large gap of Rs 1.24 lakh crore is required to be plugged in the next 1.5 years to meet the near-term target,” said Banga.Although the Cabinet had approved a Rs 60,000-crore dedicated affordable housing fund – the National Urban Housing Fund - in 2018 to support the PMAY programme implementation, a considerable portion of the same has already been utilised, raising the need for more allocation.","['PMAY', 'PMAY', 'PMAY-Rural', 'PMAY', 'PMAY', 'PMAY', 'PMAY-Rural', 'PMAY', 'BE of FY2022 against Rs 10,000', 'EBR', 'PMAY-U for', 'BE of FY2021', 'PMAY', 'PMAY', 'PMAY', 'the RE for FY2021', 'FY2022', 'EBR', 'Cabinet', 'Rs', 'the National Urban Housing Fund -', 'PMAY']",[]

From High Growth to Governance Issues: Inside a Petcare Startup’s Struggles,02 March,"This story begins in August 2019, when Sequoia Capital and Matrix Partners, two of India’s marquee venture capital firms, were preparing to invest in a pet walking startup named Cozo Pets. They issued a term sheet— a non-binding agreement that contains the basic details of an investment—to pump $3.5 million each in the company.They were excited.Pet care is among the hottest internet startup spaces globally. The segment came to life in 2000, when Pets.com catapulted into Silicon Valley’s hottest startup. The company crashed spectacularly and became the symbol of the dotcom bubble, but that had little effect on the fortunes of the segment.Only recently, SoftBank-backed Wag and Rover have grown fast and attracted large amounts of capital. The sector even has its own catchy name—Doggie Tech.Owners are extravagant with pets the way parents are with children. For companies, there is money to be made from say, walking dogs, vet treatment, grooming, food and so on. But the sector has been fragmented and offline for years.It was this thriving segment that Cozo was targeting with pet wellness services such as walking, exercising and grooming. The then one-year-old company said it had served 3,500 pet parents.For a one-year-old company, Cozo was receiving plenty of attention from investors. Nexus Venture Partners, another top VC, was upset at not sealing a deal back then.The interest of investors such as Sequoia, Matrix and Nexus was understandable. Cozo’s revenue had quadrupled from Rs 50 lakh to Rs 2 crore in three months. The co-founder and CEO Vaibhav Jain affected a confident demeanour. Ola CEO Bhavish Aggarwal, who shares a common investor in Matrix, was also planning to invest.Not A ‘Purrfect’ CompanyIn August, Sequoia and Matrix conducted due diligence to examine the company’s numbers, customers and dog-walkers. They were about to verify if all the fervour Cozo was generating was for real. They were in for a shock.In a Gurugram locality, the investors found about 20 dogs being walked by people wearing Cozo t-shirts. So far so good.One investor asked a security guard who was around, “Do these people come here every day? To walk dogs?”“This is the first time I am seeing them,” said the guard who had been serving in the area for years.The investors dug for more information and found out that the 20-odd dogs and their walkers were specifically planted at that location that day for the due diligence. The walkers and customers confessed that they had been coached by the founders on what to say when the investors turned up.Cozo denied this, saying they were unaware of any such diligence happeningThere were more nasty surprises in store. Cozo was also siphoning off money to relatives of the founders, sending lakhs for vague services. Revenue was inflated.Digital payments were already pervasive in India by 2019. But Cozo claimed that all of its revenue was in cash. There was not a single bank or online payment from a customer.This account has been pieced together from people who are intimately familiar with the matters of Cozo. All of them spoke on the condition of anonymity.Moneycontrol has also verified bank statements, legal notices and other documents to the company’s operations.Sequoia and Matrix declined to comment for this article.What happened after the due diligence?Sequoia and Matrix recused themselves from the deal. Neither firm has seen something as brazen as Cozo’s shenanigans, according to people aware of their operations. In response to Moneycontrol’s queries, Cozo denied this, saying they were not aware of any such diligence, and that they turned down Sequoia and Matrix due to onerous deal terms The matter did not end there.Cozo’s other investors, including Snapdeal founders Kunal Bahl and Rohit Bansal’s Titan Capital, were stuck. The startup had raised Rs 2.5 crore in the months prior. The money, its usage, or lack of it, and a series of questionable decisions from the company has created a rift between investors and the company.Titan Capital too did not comment.The BeginningCozo Pets (Brujun Technologies Pvt. Ltd) was founded by two former Uber executives, Vaibhav Jain and Yasir Khalil, along with Jain’s lawyer wife Minal Kaushik, a significant shareholder but not heavily involved in the business. Jain, an MBA from XLRI was the operations and training lead at Uber, responsible for working with drivers and managing relationships. Previously, he was the head of learning and development, an HR function at Bajaj Finserv.Khalil, an engineer from IIT Guwahati, worked on the customer support experience at Uber, before he co-founded Zorro Solutions, a tech-enabled customer support firm.Adit Parekh remembers that he was impressed by Jain. Parekh is part of the software unicorn Freshworks and was earlier an investor with Blume Ventures. He has seen more than 20 startups in the pet care space.Parekh did not evaluate the space the way investors usually do, diving into reports from multinational firms about market sizes and macroeconomic data and studying business models.He was convinced about the potential of the sector, drawing from the first-hand view of the struggles his neighbour in Mumbai faced. The neighbour’s husky (a sled dog) was hit by an autorickshaw and broke her spine. The lack of infrastructure for finding vets and facilities during a crisis made Parekh, a dog lover, interested in the pet care space.Parekh decided to invest Rs 15 lakh and roped in his friend Viren Doshi, a Malaysia-based travel executive, who decided to commit Rs 10 lakh. FirstCheque, a micro VC firm, committed about Rs 25 lakh and the Snapdeal founders’ Titan Capital invested another Rs 2 crore.They were all gung-ho about the company’s growth, the founders’ reputation (Jain himself had three pets and loved them a lot, one person said) and the market opportunity.And then the due diligence happened. Soon after, the larger deal fell through, exposing the cracks in the company.Parekh says he is over Cozo today. But you can sense the hurt and shock that lingers in his voice.Parekh was more than just an angel investor for Cozo. He was their first ever investor. He introduced the founders to all the other investors. He was involved in hiring and interviewing candidates for senior roles. Often, he said he picked up Jain’s calls at midnight asking for company advice.After Sequoia and Matrix withdrew from the deal, Cozo’s existing investors launched their own investigation.First, they stumbled on related party transactions. Cozo was less a startup, more a family business, and not in a good way, they found out.In July and August 2019, Cozo paid Rs 56.64 lakh to Zorro (co-founder Khalil’s call centre, remember?) through 10 transactions, show bank account statements reviewed by Moneycontrol. Khalil was and still is majority shareholder and a director at Zorro, said people familiar with the matter.In August, Cozo paid Rs 27.6 lakh to CEO Jain’s brother-in-law. The money is supposed to be six months advance and six months deposit payment for premises rented from his brother-in-law and father-in-law. Moneycontrol has reviewed a copy of the rental agreements.The same month, Cozo also paid Rs 6.93 lakh to Jain’s sister in law, in lieu of making t-shirts and caps for the company’s dog-walkers.“The moment you see related party transactions (RPTs) is when you know there's something amiss,” Parekh said.Company law in general places restrictions upon RPT, and Brujun Technologies’ shareholder agreement in particular restricts RPT unless voted upon, said people familiar with the matter.The investors demanded an explanation from Jain. Through the course of the past two years, Jain’s responses have been a combination of denial, or partly accepting and then somehow justifying what was happening, said people aware of the matter.Cozo however told Moneycontrol that investors were aware of these transactions, that payments to Zorro were stopped when investors demanded it, and that they were verified by an auditor.“He will look you dead in the eye and casually lie to you. It is eerie,” said one person directly involved in those discussions.Cozo likely did not have any customers of note, except those it artificially created, said the people familiar with the matter. All the so-called cash transactions, meant to be ‘revenue’, was possibly actually the investors’ own money shown as revenue when cash is deposited in the bank, they suspect.When the angel investors and micro VCs invested, they did not check for customers . This is not unusual because when angel investors approach a startup in the early stage, it does not have the systems, processes and records to show for due diligence. This arrangement suited Cozo fine as it may not have had much to show.Cozo strongly denied this, saying it did have customers. It also said that it handled cash transactions because it was in the process of setting up online payments while its technology platform was still being developed.Even in late 2019 and afterwards, for many months, Jain had several meetings with his investors. When confronted with evidence of fraud and mismanagement of funds, he promised to return the money. Only a portion of the total investment has been returned though.There were always excuses for the delay. But investors were getting jittery.""Part of angel investing is spending time with the founders and making relevant connections to help the business scale. But when your trust is broken, it is just a sinking feeling,” Parekh said.Let’s Go LegalInvestors finally had enough. On September 25, they sent a 13-page legal notice to the promoters and directors of Cozo. Barring Titan Capital, other investors asked to be paid Rs 65,37,033, which covers their investment of Rs 50 lakh, 18 percent interest per annum and Rs 3.75 lakh incurred towards legal costs to complain to the Registrar of Companies, Income Tax Department and Serious Frauds Investigation Office (One person familiar with the matter said that the Registrar of Companies has closed the case because it did not fall under its jurisdiction)They asked for this money because of Cozo Pet’s “illegal and deliberate financial irregularities corporate governance non-compliances, commission of fraudulent activities, misappropriation and syphoning of funds, acts of mismanagement of the Affairs of the Company, breach of trust and fiduciary duties,” according to the notice, which Moneycontrol has seen a copy of.Cozo did not officially respond to the notice for some time, only asking for a 45 days grace period to comply with the notice. The investors followed up with another notice on October 9, with the same allegations, but threatening to sue this time.This time Khalil responded with a three-page reply of his own, alleging among other things, that the investors “used investment as a tool to stall our business and our company so that you can start your ventures or invest in existing or new competitive ventures”. Cozo was amicable all along while the investors took the seemingly ugly legal route, according to Khalil.“It seems that you never wanted our company and its business to be a success. You approached us with a malicious objective, to destroy our business and start your own venture or invest in existing or new competitive ventures for higher profits,” the response reads.Incidentally, Titan Capital recently invested in Super Tails, a digital pet care platform.Khalil said in the response that the company is ready to give back the money it raised. It even returned 10 percent of the money invested.The rest has not come, despite repeated promises, repeated texts, calls and WhatsApp messages. Cozo told Moneycontrol that it wanted investors to sign a non-compete agreement before returning the money, claiming that investors were impatient. What now?Cozo Pets now seems to have pivoted from its dog-walking plans to online vet consultations. This strategy is in line with the COVID-19 pandemic shifting operations of several companies online.The vet consultation platform Cozo Plus is available on Google’s Android Play Store. But it is not accessible on Apple’s App Store in India.Even the Android version does not seem to work, when this reporter and six other people tried it out. It asks for your mobile number to send a One Time Password (OTP), but the OTP does not come.Cozo’s investors have no idea what the company is up to. The founders have not responded to their calls or messages for the last six months or so, and unless they go to court, the investors may never recover their money, said people familiar with the matter.They are hesitant about going to court because there is no guarantee how long the process will take. Even if the judgement is in their favour, it is unclear if the founders will have any money to return.Why did they do it?The total amount Cozo raised—Rs 2.5 crore—is not much in the startup and VC world. Many startups routinely raise a lot more with flawed (but not fraud) business models.The three founders, well-educated and with corporate careers, could arguably have made the same money in salaries over the next few years.So why did the founders of Cozo build a company on a pack of lies and deceit as the investors accuse them of?Nobody can tell for sure.""More than just losing money, it's their brazenness that hurts. These guys have no moral compass and took us all for a ride,” said angel investor Doshi, Parekh’s friend, who works in Malaysia for tourism company Tui.""Even today, I'm not sure why he (Vaibhav Jain) did it. He could have made the same money legally easily. He's a smooth talking cold blooded scamster,” he added.Some well-networked investors still speak about Cozo in hushed tones every now and then. It has taken investors ages to reconcile with what happened.Early-stage investing is a game of trust, no matter how much diligence an investor does. The largest success stories, say, Flipkart, Swiggy and Freshworks have succeeded because of this trust. But every once in a while, a Cozo comes along, shaking things up.The Cozo incident holds particular significance currently, when India is in the middle of an unprecedented startup and funding boom. Many of the business models going around are work-in-progress, as Moneycontrol reported earlier. Some work. Some do not. But, when they do not work because of non-business reasons,  eyebrows are raised.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/startup/from-high-growth-to-governance-issues-inside-a-petcare-startups-struggles-7143511.html,Funding,"Through the course of the past two years, Jain’s responses have been a combination of denial, or partly accepting and then somehow justifying what was happening, said people aware of the matter.Cozo however told Moneycontrol that investors were aware of these transactions, that payments to Zorro were stopped when investors demanded it, and that they were verified by an auditor.“He will look you dead in the eye and casually lie to you.Barring Titan Capital, other investors asked to be paid Rs 65,37,033, which covers their investment of Rs 50 lakh, 18 percent interest per annum and Rs 3.75 lakh incurred towards legal costs to complain to the Registrar of Companies, Income Tax Department and Serious Frauds Investigation Office (One person familiar with the matter said that the Registrar of Companies has closed the case because it did not fall under its jurisdiction)They asked for this money because of Cozo Pet’s “illegal and deliberate financial irregularities corporate governance non-compliances, commission of fraudulent activities, misappropriation and syphoning of funds, acts of mismanagement of the Affairs of the Company, breach of trust and fiduciary duties,” according to the notice, which Moneycontrol has seen a copy of.Cozo did not officially respond to the notice for some time, only asking for a 45 days grace period to comply with the notice.","['Moneycontrol', 'Zorro', 'Barring Titan Capital', 'the Registrar of Companies', 'Income Tax Department', 'Serious Frauds Investigation Office', 'the Affairs of the Company', 'Moneycontrol']",['$3.5 million']

"Exclusive: Policybazaar aims to file DRHP for IPO in July, eyes $4-5 billion valuation",01 July,"Online insurance marketplace Policybazaar plans to file its draft documents to go public in July, and eventually list by November-December at a valuation of $4-5 billion, a valuation higher than previously planned, underscoring investor interest for one of the year’s most anticipated Initial Public Offerings (IPOs), sources said.Policybazaar’s parent Etech Aces Marketing and Consulting Pvt Ltd needs to get board approval, which it plans to do in the coming weeks, following which it will file its Draft Red Herring Prospectus with the market regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI).It plans to raise $400-500 million in a local listing by selling primary and secondary shares, at a valuation of $4-5 billion, said these people, who requested anonymity since these discussions are private. It hasn’t finalised how much it will raise or the primary/secondary component yet.“They had planned to file the DRHP by now but things got delayed because of the pandemic’s second wave. Finance and legal teams are working closely with the investment bankers to file the DRHP this month, maybe in the next couple of weeks” said one person involved in discussions.“Once they file, it needs approval from SEBI as well as IRDAI (the insurance regulator). Insurance is a highly regulated sector. Approvals will take time, so they are expecting to list by November-December,” this person added.A Policybazaar spokesperson declined to comment.Mint reported in February that Policybazaar is planning to raise about $400 million (Rs 4,000 crore) at a valuation of $3.5 billion. However, the valuation is now expected to be higher, led by positive investor sentiment for internet IPOs. Further, Policybazaar is currently negotiating secondary share sales at a valuation of $3.8-3.9 billion, where early investors are offloading a part of their stake. Primary share sales, where the company issues new shares are expected to be at a higher valuation of at least $4.2 billion or so. It could further increase depending on reception from investors during roadshows. Moneycontrol reported in February that the SoftBank and Premji Invest-backed firm is appointing Kotak Mahindra Capital, Morgan Stanley, ICICI Securities and Citi as advisors for its IPO.For FY20, the latest fiscal for which its numbers are available, Policybazaar recorded a loss of Rs 218 crore on a revenue of Rs 515 crore, compared to a loss of Rs 213 crore on a revenue of Rs 310 crore in FY19. One person tracking the company said that its revenue has doubled and losses have come down since its last filing.“The business fundamentally has good economics and they are well capitalised. Raising primary money is a smaller objective of the IPO. They can get a good valuation with the current market sentiment and the IPO serves as a testimony to the company’s maturity,” this person added.Policybazaar was founded in 2008 by Yashish Dahiya, who hails from an army family and had himself planned to join the army for many years. His army background is also part of why he refused money from Chinese investors during the Doklam standoff, and was open to buying back Chinese investor Tencent’s stake recently, given Indo-China political tensions.A graduate of IIT Delhi and MBA school INSEAD, he started up in the insurance space driven by what an unnatural industry it is and how much could be done. “What you sell here is a promise. You are paying for a promise. And the best-case scenario here, for both parties, is if you never use the product,” he said at an industry event recently. Until it got funded by Naukri.com parent InfoEdge- its first outside investor, Policybazaar couldn’t even pay any of its 18 co-founders. Even at a mature stage, Dahiya feels Policybazaar still has a lot of room to grow. “Currently about 6 crore families in India can afford private insurance of a meaningful kind. Only 15 percent of these families have insurance, and this 6 crore will become 15 crore in the next 10 years. That is inevitable.

World Bank says will boost COVID-19 vaccine funding to $20 billion,01 July,"The World Bank on Wednesday pledged to boost available funding for COVID-19 vaccine purchases and deployment to $20 billion from a previous target of $12 billion, citing a sharp increase in overall financing demand from developing countries.World Bank President David Malpass said the global development bank had already provided more than $4 billion to 51 developing countries for the purchase and deployment of COVID-19 vaccines, and would add billions for 25 more countries soon.""Much more will follow in coming weeks,"" Malpass told reporters, noting that a total of 41 requests had been received from African countries, where less than half the population has been vaccinated.In a joint statement developing-countries, the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and the World Health Organization urged G20 countries to embrace vaccinated population targets of at least 40% by the end of 2021 and 60% by the first half of 2022.They also urged the G20 major economies, whose finance leaders meet next week in Italy, to adopt the goal of sharing at least 1 billion vaccine doses with developing countries this year, and to increase financing and eliminate trade barriers in the vaccine supply chain.COVID-19 VaccineFrequently Asked QuestionsA vaccine works by mimicking a natural infection. A vaccine not only induces immune response to protect people from any future COVID-19 infection, but also helps quickly build herd immunity to put an end to the pandemic. Herd immunity occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population becomes immune to a disease, making the spread of disease from person to person unlikely. The good news is that SARS-CoV-2 virus has been fairly stable, which increases the viability of a vaccine.There are broadly four types of vaccine — one, a vaccine based on the whole virus (this could be either inactivated, or an attenuated [weakened] virus vaccine); two, a non-replicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of SARS-CoV; three, nucleic-acid vaccines that have genetic material like DNA and RNA of antigens like spike protein given to a person, helping  human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine; and four, protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombinant proteins of SARS-COV-2 along with an adjuvant (booster) is given as a vaccine.Vaccine development is a long, complex process. Unlike drugs that are given to people with a diseased, vaccines are given to healthy people and also vulnerable sections such as children, pregnant women and the elderly. So rigorous tests are compulsory. History says that the fastest time it took to develop a vaccine is five years, but it usually takes double or sometimes triple that time.RELEASE DOSESMalpass also redoubled his call for countries with surplus doses to release them and any options for more for use by developing countries, with adequate plans for distribution.The World Bank was also continuing to press for greater transparency by governments and pharmaceutical companies about vaccine contracts, options and agreements, he said.""We're at war with the vaccine,"" Malpass said, adding that tight supplies and high demand made it crucial to have sufficient information to keep production flowing. ""COVID's not going to go away quickly. It's going to be a long-term war.""The decision to increase funding for vaccinations reflects growing concern about widely divergent vaccination rates between advanced economies and developing countries, World Bank officials said.The World Bank has seen a sharp increase in overall financing demand from developing countries - not just health-related expenditure - during the pandemic, said the bank's managing director for operations, Axel van Trotsenburg.He told reporters that the World Bank's International Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the International Development Association had made lending commitments of nearly $100 billion since the start of the crisis, well above the normal level of just under $60 billion. High demand for financing was expected to continue well into 2022, he said.Van Trotsenburg noted that many middle-income countries in Latin America had been requesting financing from the bank, noting that requests totaling over $1 billion had been received in the past six weeks alone.The World Bank's vaccine financing package can be used by countries to buy vaccine doses through COVAX, the new African Vaccine Acquisition Task Team (AVATT) or other sources.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/world/world-bank-says-will-boost-covid-19-vaccine-funding-to-20-billion-7110751.html,Funding,"""Much more will follow in coming weeks,"" Malpass told reporters, noting that a total of 41 requests had been received from African countries, where less than half the population has been vaccinated.In a joint statement developing-countries, the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and the World Health Organization urged G20 countries to embrace vaccinated population targets of at least 40% by the end of 2021 and 60% by the first half of 2022.They also urged the G20 major economies, whose finance leaders meet next week in Italy, to adopt the goal of sharing at least 1 billion vaccine doses with developing countries this year, and to increase financing and eliminate trade barriers in the vaccine supply chain.COVID-19 VaccineFrequently Asked QuestionsA vaccine works by mimicking a natural infection.The good news is that SARS-CoV-2 virus has been fairly stable, which increases the viability of a vaccine.There are broadly four types of vaccine — one, a vaccine based on the whole virus (this could be either inactivated, or an attenuated [weakened] virus vaccine); two, a non-replicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of SARS-CoV; three, nucleic-acid vaccines that have genetic material like DNA and RNA of antigens like spike protein given to a person, helping  human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine; and four, protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombinant proteins of SARS-COV-2 along with an adjuvant (booster) is given as a vaccine.Vaccine development is a long, complex process.","['the World Bank', 'the International Monetary Fund', 'the World Health Organization', 'G20', 'G20', 'RNA']","['$20 billion', '$12 billion', 'more than $4 billion', 'nearly $100 billion', 'just under $60 billion', 'over $1 billion']"
"Meet VC Analysts, the under-the-radar backbones of top VC firms",30 June,"Last month, an analyst at a top venture fund brought a potential deal to his seniors. The analyst was excited. The consumer brand was young, growing fast, and its founder oozed charisma—confident, compelling and courageous. But a partner at the fund who heard the analyst’s pitch was not impressed. The analyst had been taken in by the founder’s charm and vision and hadn’t seen the underlying numbers.The fledgling company had projected revenue for a decade based on little more than optimism and extreme best-case assumptions. The company’s customer acquisition cost was triple what it stated and in the partner’s estimation, it was nowhere close to fundable. “It was an eye-opener. Then I went back and saw historical data on companies and sectors performed during and after a boom market. It chilled me to my bones. It is easy to get carried away by the euphoria during this boom, but also dangerous,” said the analyst, requesting anonymity. Meet the analystsIn the venture capital (VC) industry, general partners (GPs) tend to hog the limelight—privately and publicly, intentionally and unintentionally. They are subjects of profiles, recipients of awards, lightning rods for critique, and among the most spoken-about people in the start-up industry.Analysts are the exact opposite. An analyst at a venture fund is the lowest ranking member of the investment team. It is not even a permanent role. At most firms, analysts enroll in a two-year program after which they generally pursue an MBA degree.Unlike other investment members, analysts don’t have access to a firm’s internal finances. They are not privy to details about a VC firm’s own investors—Limited Partners (LPs)—and generally don’t get a share of the firm’s profits or ‘carry’.Yet, the venture ecosystem cannot do without them. These 22 to 25-year-old men and women scout deals. They develop networks. They have their ears to the ground and help portfolio companies in gritty day-to-day work. They also play Man Fridays to their respective firms with aplomb. Many analysts have gone on to become among the most influential people in the start-up scene (see graphic- Analysts who made it big). VC firms pride themselves on their analyst programs and a VC analyst stint generally opens up doors to a lucrative career nearly anywhere-—global consultancies, investment banks, technology start-ups or private equity firms.  The role of an analyst also lays bare the quirks of the VC industry. A partner is responsible for the firm’s investments, exits, future and relationships. The role of an analyst is ... similar.Partners source deals. So do analysts. Partners help portfolio firms. So do analysts. Few professions have the junior most and senior most people doing largely the same thing, only with varying levels of accountability.These quirks have been exposed even more in the last one year, when the Covid-19 pandemic changed life as we knew it. Analysts new to the industry have been working from home, trying to source deals while sitting in their shorts in the middle of the night, cold calling founders, other investors and investment bankers.And in the last six months, analysts have also been mystified by the startup funding frenzy gripping India. They have had to do deals at a time when the market seems to be fundamentally shifting beneath their feet, and at a time when internet entrepreneurs have higher expectations than ever before.This is their story.Ishwar Prasad, an analyst with A91 Partners, has spoken to 150-200 founders in the last two years. He throws the figure casually, as we discuss a myriad of other things. But the number sticks because it defines what a venture capitalist, particularly an analyst needs to have- hustle.At Matrix Partners, one of India’s biggest VC firms, analysts are encouraged to meet 15-20 founders every week. And the senior investor overseeing them—directors or managing directors—checks with them on how many people they met and which of these are worth exploring further.The role is similar at most large VC firms, where analysts are expected to both source deals and do backend work, build financial models, help portfolio companies with specific projects, and assist in due diligence.  Young investors engage in this hustle in different ways. Some take red-eye flights. Some try very hard to see every hot deal in the market, by stretching their networks as far and wide as they can. Some post motivational thoughts on LinkedIn and Twitter, meant to portray them as young thought leaders.The common thread in all of them? They are extremely ambitious.The hustle that VC firms expect is harder to pursue during a pandemic, during different phases of which, you are alone, cooped up in a room, you or those around you are in distress and yet oddly enough, work is busier than ever as internet start-ups took off massively due to rising digital adoption.Work cultureVC firms are also relatively unstructured and have less hierarchy than most organized professions- consulting, banking, IT,  financial services, or others. Teams are generally small- even top firms may have a team of just 10-15 people doing investments. Everyone does a little bit of everything.Kriti Arora joined A91 Partners- a $350 million fund run by former partners at Sequoia- as an Analyst in February 2020, weeks before the first lockdown in India.  Coming from consulting giant McKinsey- the source of many VCs India and abroad- she was thrown into the deep end, having to cultivate internal and external networks largely working from home.“VC firms, especially compared to consulting firms, are rather unstructured. It takes time to get used to that. It was a challenge. There are days with an extreme amount of work and days where there's nothing. But that's when you have to keep yourself motivated,” Arora says.Working from home was a double-edged sword for many of these analysts. Some found freedom they had previously craved. They could work when they wanted and sleep when they wanted if they coordinated timings with their seniors. They found time to work out, to read, to chat.But they all took time to adjust. One analyst at a top firm joked that some months she didn’t feel she deserved her salary, while other months she felt she should be earning double what she was being paid.And by most standards, VC analysts are paid handsomely. Analysts at the top 5-6 firms earn about Rs 30 lakh a year. They are generally 22-25 years old, have an engineering or commerce degree from an elite institution and a one or two of post-degree experience, at consulting firms, investment banks or start-ups. VC firms sometimes have a high-pressure work culture, especially for young investors. Working through the night to close a deal, taking six flights a week (pre-pandemic) and packing your calendar with overlapping events is not unheard of. One firm is trying a different approach though. At A91, analysts say they don’t get calls from partners after 7pm- virtually unheard of at most top firms. People close to the firm also said that this is a conscious effort, where partners are trying to give analysts more leeway, not monitor their performance too closely, and let analysts take their own time to learn the ropes.A91’s Prasad used this leeway to coordinate with his team and work from 4am to 9am- time when he felt most productive- for many months, leaving his evenings free for workouts and hobbies Such a scenario is unimaginable pre-pandemic, and still hard to find in most VC firms today. Having worked at A91 for two years, Prasad is headed to the prestigious University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School later in the year to pursue his MBA.Working for smaller teams such as A91, or local funds like Blume Ventures and India Quotient also means that analysts get to spend more time with partners- understanding their thinking and absorbing their experiences. At Accel each analyst is mapped to a partner, so while he/she does learn from that partner, cross-partner interactions and learnings are less likelyAt large firms like Sequoia, analysts work closely more with principals and vice presidents, with partners addressing them more on internal team calls and big-picture meetings, not always one-to-one. SerendipityDespite the meticulously planned calendars of entrepreneurs and investors, choc-a-bloc with internal and external meetings, deal making is often serendipitous. Deals stem from distant connections, bumping into old colleagues at events, a casual tweet that results in follow ups and more. “There is a lot of serendipity attached to offline meetings, which is sometimes missed. An unplanned catch-up after an industry event or board meeting was always interesting,” says Anubhav Goyal, an Analyst at Chiratae Ventures who was promoted to Associate earlier this year.He has a point. The nature of early stage investing also leads to deals based on gut feelings, instincts and comfort with certain personality types.Analysts across VC firms have no-agenda meetings with founders and even other investors, so that when these start-ups eventually raise money, these investors have a leg-up, having established a connection already.That’s harder to do virtually, when Zoom and MS Teams calls are formal almost by design. ""One has to put in some conscious effort to make sure that the first few virtual interactions with founders and industry colleagues are engaging and not just transactional. The virtual setting has however helped in faster and more frequent interactions with the portfolio teams,” Goyal said.While deal making is the front and centre of venture capital, working with portfolio firms is also crucial for analysts, and a key part of their appraisal criteria at the end of their two year stint.More so, deal making often has some level of luck involved. Helping portfolio companies with expansion projects, cost-cutting, introducing best practices and trying to differentiate from competitors are important. Founders are often fond of younger investors who help them fix crucial parts of their companies.For instance, at bus commute startup Cityflo, Jerin Venad credits Anshika Sinha, Vice President at Lightbox Ventures with helping him realise that he needs a Chief of Staff(CoS). Sinha studied and analysed other startups she knew, and helped Venad realise that he was doing too many things that weren't his responsibility or strength. The CoS is more senior, analytical and diligent than Venad, he says, and lets him focus on the big picture.Sinha also helps compare salaries to peers when Cityflo hires for senior roles.Similarly, Siddarth Jain, analyst at Accel helped SaaS startup Securden formulate its content marketing strategy. By speaking to others and analysing competition, he helped the company improve its search engine optimisation, improved its blogs and made its content more relevant and accessible. The unexpected boomBesides the pandemic, analysts have also had to reckon with the biggest and most unexpected boom in India’s internet funding history. At the end of 2019, led by Uber’s tepid IPO and WeWork’s failure to list, investors had grown wary of funding large unprofitable internet startups.Already cautious of high-burn companies, the Covid-19 pandemic was expected to drag sentiment down further, which it did, but only temporarily. The last six to nine months have seen an unprecedented funding boom across stages, something that has rattled even experienced investors who are struggling to connect the dots.Analysts too have been grappling with this reality. One result of the pandemic-led boom is that entrepreneurs sometimes have sky-high expectations. They want the most aggressive valuations and they negotiate only with the partners at a fund, finding analysts too junior to seriously engage with. This has been a pre-pandemic problem as well, where experienced founders especially prefer speaking to partners directly.Founders contend that sometimes analysts ask only skin-deep questions and ask for confidential numbers-growth, user retention, revenue etc-  which they may then use to evaluate competitors.Analysts carry this reputational risk- of peskily enquiring numbers and not doing much else—to such an extent that VC firms—for whom brand and image is paramount, are trying to solve the issue. At Accel, one of India’s largest VCs and a backer of Flipkart, Swiggy and Freshworks, analysts are discouraged from deal sourcing in their first year. “Our first-year analysts do more diligence and help portfolio companies because we think that builds an understanding of the space. We don't want them to be mere call centers. In their second year they do deal sourcing, which is about 30-40% of their total work ” Prayank Swaroop, partner at Accel said.“It is unfortunate that nobody cares about analysts and associates in the founder world. It is changing, but very slowly. So we are trying to train our analysts, such that the founder meets them and he is blown away” he added.Analysts help VC firms stay nimble, be aware of new sectors and opportunities. More so during the current boom, where VC firms are trying to stay nimbler than ever, wanting to see all the best deals, and yet carefully picking a select few, trying to avoid their biases and open up their minds. “An analyst can provide a fresh perspective. A partner’s experience is invaluable but they have strong perspectives on sectors. So I feel as an analyst I should push their thinking and help reassess status quo beliefs and assumptions with a fresh pair of eyes. The fund should not become an echo chamber,” says Prasad of A91 Partners.But this is hard to implement. Analysts are fiercely competitive, and sometimes insecure. Some try to curry favour with partners by feeding their biases.If a partner does not like logistics companies, neither will the analyst. If the partner feels the fintech sector overvalued, the analyst will agree. Some analysts are constantly trying to figure out what their friends at other firms are investing in. Newer analysts sometimes have a fear-of-missing-out, especially when they see press articles about large funding rounds or hear of their peers close deals. They gradually come to terms with the ups and downs of investing.“It's important to know that venture investing is a non-linear activity. You can do one deal a week for a few weeks and then nothing for months. And that's okay as long as you are consistent in the process of learning and meeting entrepreneurs,” says Chiratae’s Goyal.There is even a WhatsApp group for young investors across firms- ‘Associates and Analysts’, meant to help each other out, say three members of this group. If someone is looking for research on a subject, a specific article, or even a connection somewhere, they message on this group. Members are usually helpful, but also aware of the competitive risk. They cannot be seen giving details that even signal what deal they are working on, or what project they are working on. They balance competitive pressures but try to be as useful as they can. The endgameThe vagaries of venture capital is not for everyone. Many of these analysts, after their two years, don’t become investors. They become bankers, entrepreneurs, management consultants. They are all generally extraordinarily successful in the traditional sense. After all, VC firms pride themselves on selecting the best of the best- whatever that means to them. Yet most of them are grateful for the experience. Kriti Arora of A91 joined the firm knowing she doesn’t want to have an investing career. She quit to start-up in the remote working space, but her investing stint taught her about life on the other side, and she says it will help her be a better entrepreneur.Vikram Chopra, co-founder and CEO of Cars24 agrees. “Being an analyst taught me the power of critical and objective thinking. As a founder you obviously have to love your business and are very attached to it. But it is also important to be dispassionate and look at things from afar,” says Chopra, who was an analyst at Sequoia from 2009-11.“Does my business have a real differentiator? Is the market big enough? I shouldn’t be blinded by passion and that’s what I learnt,” he added.During the pandemic these analysts were sometimes a little rattled, a little low and a little anxious. But they say they are better investors , and better people for it.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/startup/meet-vc-analysts-the-under-the-radar-backbones-of-top-vc-firms-7107081.html,Funding,"People close to the firm also said that this is a conscious effort, where partners are trying to give analysts more leeway, not monitor their performance too closely, and let analysts take their own time to learn the ropes.A91’s Prasad used this leeway to coordinate with his team and work from 4am to 9am- time when he felt most productive- for many months, leaving his evenings free for workouts and hobbies Such a scenario is unimaginable pre-pandemic, and still hard to find in most VC firms today.The virtual setting has however helped in faster and more frequent interactions with the portfolio teams,” Goyal said.While deal making is the front and centre of venture capital, working with portfolio firms is also crucial for analysts, and a key part of their appraisal criteria at the end of their two year stint.More so, deal making often has some level of luck involved.","['A91', 'Prasad']",['$350 million']
"Exclusive | Infra.Market eyes $2.6b valuation, nearly 3x jump in 3 months in Tiger-led round: Sources",29 June,"Construction materials marketplace Infra.Market is in advanced talks to raise $125 million led by existing investor Tiger Global Management at a valuation of $2.6 billion post-money, continuing the New York-based firm’s aggressive deal-making streak in Indian startups, sources said.The round will more than double Infra.Market’s valuation from just three months back when it was valued at a billion dollars, said these people, who requested anonymity since talks are private.Founded by Souvik Sengupta and Aaditya Sharda in 2016, Infra.Market is a business-to-business (B2B) e-commerce firm, running a brand of construction material, concrete and chemicals used in infrastructure projects. It ties up with contract manufacturers, gets them to utilise idle capacity and manufacture products under its own brand, which it then sells to large infrastructure companies and retail outlets.Infra.Market currently has an annual revenue run rate of $700 million, or monthly revenue of $58 million (Rs 408 crore), compared to Rs 200 crore monthly revenue in March, when it last raised $100 million led by Tiger and became a unicorn- a term for privately held firms valued at a billion dollars or more.Its other investors include Accel, Nexus Venture Partners and Sistema Asia.While Tiger’s investment is expected to close in the coming weeks, Infra.Market has also separately held conversations with private equity giant TPG for an investment at a similar valuation. However these talks are still at an early stage.Tiger and TPG declined to comment while Infra.Market denied funding discussions.“We are not in discussions with Tiger Global for an investment...The valuation numbers you have mentioned are magical. Hope they are true. But sadly no such discussions,” Sengupta said in an emailed response.“They are growing super fast, and that too at this scale. Tiger realises that if they do not, someone else will lead this round. So, they are closing their investment quickly, and other large investors may join in later,” said one person briefed on the matter, requesting anonymity.Tiger’s latest investment underlines its breathtaking, unprecedented investing spree in startups world-over (and India) in the last few months. Tiger has invested close to a billion dollars in Indian internet firms this year, this person added.As per founders who have raised money from Tiger, the Scott Shleifer-led firm is creating an index of promising internet startups, picking up stakes in all the companies it finds promising- across sectors, stages and sometimes taking multiple bets in a sector.Another B2B commerce firm - OfBusiness - is raising money from SoftBank at a valuation of $1.5 billion, Moneycontrol exclusively reported on June 2. OfBusiness originally started lending by providing raw material, but later expanded to ecommerce as well. Industrial goods marketplace Moglix too became a unicorn earlier this year, when Falcon Edge Capital led a $100 million round.Infra.Market is one of India’s most unique unicorns- it was bootstrapped for three years, operates in a very offline and fragmented market like infrastructure goods and most rare of all- it is profitable.“(India) has a lot of idle manufacturing capacity. India has 550 million tons of cement capacity, but only 270 million is actually utilised. Manufacturing from small local producers is widely available. So our thinking was: can we create a brand in this space? Can we follow the same model for multiple products?,” Sengupta told Moneycontrol in an interview in March.“We bootstrapped it for three years. We ran it profitably for three years. But banking in India moves slowly for startups, even if you're profitable. So we took our first cheque from Accel, and since then, we have grown exponentially.

"Explained | After a startup raises money, how is it managed?",24 June,"Startup news is generally dominated by headlines of large funding rounds, often at seemingly high valuations. How this money comes in, and how so many millions of dollars are managed by young companies are less known. It isn’t as simple as it sounds. Moneycontrol explains:How does startup funding work?Startups raise multiple rounds of funding, from their initial ‘seed’ money to Series A, B, and so on. Each round is generally larger than the previous one and at a higher share price/ valuation. In each round, the company issues new shares in exchange for money from investors.  The founders' stake reduces after each round. For mature companies or unicorns, founders may hold a smaller stake- say less than 10 percent, but these shares become quite valuable over time. Founders prefer diluting less with each round. Many founders dilute 15-30 percent for their first round, but may sell only 0.5 percent or 1-2 percent of their shares later on, because those shares are now quite valuable.When a startup raises money, does the money come in all at once?Good question. It still varies from case to case, but top founders prefer getting the money in one go, rather than in tranches. In the current environment, where internet startups are spoilt for money, founders dictate terms, and hence, sending money in tranches is uncommon, even for large rounds of $100 million or more.That said, some early-stage VCs still say they want to give the money in 2-3 tranches over a year or so, to promote frugality from the entrepreneur. One VC says that the founder may not initially appreciate it, but when he/she builds a company frugally and gets the rest of the round when needed, they realise its value.If an amount of funding is promised, why can’t investors just send all the money in one go?They can, and that’s what is happening these days. But in some cases, more in private equity investments for traditional companies, funding is also contingent on performance goals. The money raised is not simply in exchange for shares of the company but also sometimes tied to revenue milestones, market share or other metrics. This is less common for technology companies, where milestones are harder to define, but the argument is that not giving all the money upfront keeps the founder/company incentivised. The flipside is that these investments are inherently made trusting the founder, and that trust also involves giving the money upfront. In the current market, investors also want to win the hottest deals, and are hence likely to agree to terms of sending all the money upfront.Where does all this money go?When a company raises $100 million, not all the money is going to be used immediately, right? In fact that’s true of smaller rounds of say $5 million as well, but more relevant for larger rounds, where a lot of the money can remain unused for years.Most of this capital is invested in liquid assets such as equity and debt mutual funds, fixed deposits and bonds.That sounds like a lot of work, especially for a small startup.It is. Early-stage startups generally just put the money in a fixed deposit (FD), which is the easiest option with the least hassle. The money can at least generate some interest, which can also be used for business purposes later on.And the larger ones?As a startup gets larger, it hires dedicated people for finance- a Chief Financial Officer (CFO) or Finance Controller to handle the company’s investments. Many internet companies even work with dedicated wealth managers from funds such as IIFL or Kotak among others, who advise them on their company’s investments.This function, called treasury management can also constitute an important if less-publicised role at a startup, because in many cases- tens to hundreds of millions of dollars are being invested in these short term assets. They need to be spread across assets that will generate a return- but the money should be liquid- be able to withdraw it the moment it is needed.What else?Startups raise money from venture capitalists by selling shares and from venture debt funds- by taking a loan. VCs and debt funds both help their portfolio companies with investment management too. Investors want to be more than mere money bags and promise a suite of portfolio services including investment management, hiring for senior roles, and analysts at VC firms often work closely with companies on specific projects- almost like an employee of that company.How do companies decide where to invest? It is like any investment decision, a question of liquidity and returns. Any non-liquid assets, say real estate, or anything too risky- say bitcoin, are no-nos for most startups. The point is preserving the capital and earning whatever possible return on it.Tax efficiency also matters. Some startups make use of the government’s Startup India plan, under which startups can get tax breaks. Loss-making startups (and most startups by design don’t make profits in the early years) can carry forward losses and set that off against profitable investments. Startup India offers a 10-year window, in which for 3 years startups can get tax waivers. Many companies plan their investments keeping these laws in mind.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/startup/explained-after-a-startup-raises-money-how-is-it-managed-7078871.html,Funding,"In the current environment, where internet startups are spoilt for money, founders dictate terms, and hence, sending money in tranches is uncommon, even for large rounds of $100 million or more.That said, some early-stage VCs still say they want to give the money in 2-3 tranches over a year or so, to promote frugality from the entrepreneur.In fact that’s true of smaller rounds of say $5 million as well, but more relevant for larger rounds, where a lot of the money can remain unused for years.Most of this capital is invested in liquid assets such as equity and debt mutual funds, fixed deposits and bonds.That sounds like a lot of work, especially for a small startup.It is.",[],"['only 0.5\xa0percent', '$100 million', '$100 million', '$5 million']"

Lightspeed invests in insurance startup BimaPe,23 June,"Lightspeed India Partners, an investor in firms such as Byju’s, OYO and Udaan, has invested in insurance startup BimaPe - which provides a digital interface for people and families to manage their insurance plans.Founded by 23-year-old Rahul Mathur, BimaPe currently condenses 50-60 page jargon-filled insurance documents into a jargon-free interface that allows users to understand what their policy covers and does not cover.BimaPe enables users to seamlessly manage their family’s insurance. Users can get an overview of all their insurance policies, make one-click claims, and discover several hidden insurance benefits from their bank cards and Provident Fund.The $545,000 pre-seed funding will help BimaPe further develop the company’s product, expand its team and invest in paid user acquisitionThe startup was also part of Y-Combinator’s Winter 2021 batch, and a person familiar with the matter said that BimaPe had also raised $1.5 million more from Lightspeed, Titan Capital, iSeed and Gemba Capital among others.“Adoption of insurance products by Indian consumers is in its infancy. India’s emerging middle class was forced to interact with online only financial services companies during the pandemic. BimaPe’s emphasis on building a product to guide users to make better insurance decisions has driven strong word of mouth in an otherwise Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) intensive market,” said Harsha Kumar, General Partner at Lightspeed India.In addition to managing your existing insurance plans, BimaPe is also in the process of acquiring an insurance brokerage license, which will help it sell insurance, make money and make its claims integration process far deeper. It has negligible revenue currently, not unusual for early stage internet startups.“We are also running a small pilot to see whether you can have automated claims. On term insurance we are partnering HDFC Life, Max Life and others, and I think the opportunity is massive.

"Exclusive | Mindtickle eyes unicorn tag, $1.1 billion valuation in SoftBank-led round",16 June,"Japanese investment giant SoftBank is in advanced talks to lead a $100 million round in software-as-a-service firm Mindtickle, doubling down on its investment from last year but at double the valuation- a billion dollars. The deal will make Mindtickle the latest member of the coveted unicorn club- of private companies with a valuation of over a billion dollars.Pune and San Francisco-based Mindtickle, founded in 2011 by Krishna Depua, Mohit Garg, Deepak Diwakar and Nishant Mungali, helps companies build sales capabilities including training, onboarding, working on each aspect of sales, practising and improving it using technology.Mindtickle helps sales executives practice their pitch before actually pitching, and collects data points such as common questions, feedback and how much time is spent on one topic to make the pitch more effective.Mindtickle last raised $100 million led by SoftBank in November last year and was valued at $500 million. “They have delivered on what they promised SoftBank. They have grown well, executed well. SoftBank is doing this round because they know somebody else will do the round if they don’t. They want to double down on a plan that has worked so far,” said a person aware of the deal dynamics, requesting anonymity.SoftBank declined to comment while Mindtickle did not respond to an email seeking comment.While Mindtickle had an Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) of about $25-30 million when SoftBank last invested, it currently has an ARR of $38 million, which will touch $40 million by the time the deal officially closes. The valuation is doubling while the revenue hasn’t doubled yet.This is also because of the funding environment, where SaaS companies are raising funds at more aggressive valuation multiples than ever before- at 30-35 times ARR.The current deal still puts Mindtickle’s valuation at about 25 times revenue- aggressive in usual times but expected during the current funding boom, said another person tracking the company, requesting anonymity.Its other investors include Norwest Venture Partners, Accel, New Enterprise Associates, Qualcomm Ventures and Canaan Partners.Mindtickle, with a number of technology-based clients and non-tech clients beginning to use tech, has benefitted from the pandemic, as sales onboarding remotely has become key. During the pandemic, “We saw our usage pick up. Because now people couldn’t do their sales kickoff anymore in person. You cannot onboard people by flying them into your headquarters. Remote communication was more important than ever. So traditional non-tech sectors actually became much more favourable to us. We have got multi-year renewals from some of these companies because they have realised that the pandemic will come and go but technology is part of our lives,” CEO Depura told Moneycontrol in an interview“We saw a lot of good traction, and in new sectors...we are seeing a domino effect. There is enough product-market fit and validation. So we have to scale. Readiness is a much bigger category today,” he added.Masayoshi Son-led SoftBank is on track to deploy $2 billion in Indian internet firms this year, including new and existing investments. These include software firms Whatfix, Zeta, Mindtickle, food delivery firm Swiggy, social commerce startup Meesho and online retailer Flipkart among others.The unicorn club- once seen as exclusive and reserved for only a few companies with massive scale and traction- has exploded in 2021, with the pandemic-led internet and technology boom benefitting companies and investors.

Once parents allow, teenagers can set their FamPay and make payments without setting up a bank account. The card details can only be accessed through the FamPay app which is device lock protected.Kusha Taneja, co-founder FamPay said, “FamCard is the first card a teen ever holds and they remember it as their first bicycle or phone. It's their first step at being responsible with money, their first step into adulthood. We plan to stay with them from this first step throughout their financial journey by evolving the product as they grow.”Mridul Arora, Partner, Elevation Capital said, “India today has a sizable population of 250M adolescents and we believe  that catering to this unserved audience with innovative products contextualized to their needs and behaviours will create a very valuable business.”FamPay's $38 million Series A is one of the largest Series A rounds for an Indian startup, underscoring investors' aggression about the startup.

Exclusive | VC firm Stellaris plans to close second fund at $220 million,16 June,"Stellaris Venture Partners, an investor in startups such as consumer brand Mamaearth and software firm Whatfix, is planning to close its second fund at $210-220 million, significantly higher than the $150-160 million it had originally planned- signaling rising demand for VC money as India is in the middle of a startup and funding boom.Stellaris declined to comment on Moneycontrol’s queries.Stellaris, founded by three former partners of Helion Ventures- Ritesh Banglani, Alok Goyal and Rahul Chowdhri, counts software firms Cisco and Infosys as well as the World Bank’s International Finance Corporation (IFC) as its Limited Partners (LPs) or backers, among others.After Helion was disbanded, Stellaris was founded in 2016 and raised a $90 million first fund in 2018. Its success has primarily been led by skincare and babycare brand Mamaearth along with Whatfix- which makes software onboarding for companies easier. Whatfix was recently valued at $600 in a SoftBank-led round, while Mamaearth is currently negotiating a fundraise valuing it at $700 million, according to sources and media reports.Stellaris combined stakes in these two firms alone- it owns 12-15 percent in both- is worth over $150 million, more than its entire first fund. Its other potentially lucrative bets include software startup Slintel, healthcare firm MFine and logistics firm Loadshare. Slintel recently raised a $20 million Series A round led by GGV Capital, while MFine is currently raising $30-40 million.From its first fund, Stellaris had only one real bust- when content platform Manch- built along the lines of Reddit- shut down in early 2020. Another of its companies- social commerce firm Shop101 was acquired by InMobi-owned Glance for $30-35 million earlier this week.“Ritesh, Rahul and Alok are a really high quality team and LPs really like they have been together for a decade. LPs like that kind of stability in fund managers, and they have performed well so far. They have been picking the right spaces and companies,” said an investor who has closely worked with them on deals, requesting anonymity.“They had planned to raise a $150-160 million fund but as they spoke to more and more US-based LPs, they realised that allocation to India is increasing. They are also well-regarded by founders and co-investors, which is important. They are generally upfront about their terms and theses. That transparency helps,” said a founder who knows the firm, but hasn’t raised money from it, requesting anonymity.A fund of over $200 million would put Stellaris closer to Accel, Matrix, Lightspeed and Nexus Venture Partners- experienced VCs and among India’s top investors who have raised the largest VC funds in India- only second to Sequoia Capital.Accel and Nexus have both raised or are raising $450-500 million funds, while Matrix’s last fund was $300 million. Lightspeed India raised a $275 million India-dedicated fund, its third, last year. Moneycontrol reported on May 10 that Matrix is eyeing a $400 million fund this yearMore than doubling its fund size also indicates Stellaris’ confidence that it can return over a billion dollars in cash over the next decade to its investors (LPs). LPs who invest in early stage venture funds generally expect a return of 4-5 times on their investment in a 7-10 year period.Barring Accel- whose early bet on Flipkart paid off handsomely, and Nexus- whose software bets have consistently worked over the years, early stage VCs who set up shop in the late 2000s, have found it challenging to return funds. The Indian startup scene has generally been plagued by a lack of exits, although this is changing recently with both large acquisitions as well as upcoming public offerings for Zomato, Paytm and others.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/startup/exclusive-vc-firm-stellaris-plans-to-close-second-fund-at-220-million-7038821.html,Funding,"Stellaris Venture Partners, an investor in startups such as consumer brand Mamaearth and software firm Whatfix, is planning to close its second fund at $210-220 million, significantly higher than the $150-160 million it had originally planned- signaling rising demand for VC money as India is in the middle of a startup and funding boom.Stellaris declined to comment on Moneycontrol’s queries.Stellaris, founded by three former partners of Helion Ventures- Ritesh Banglani, Alok Goyal and Rahul Chowdhri, counts software firms Cisco and Infosys as well as the World Bank’s International Finance Corporation (IFC) as its Limited Partners (LPs) or backers, among others.After Helion was disbanded, Stellaris was founded in 2016 and raised a $90 million first fund in 2018.That transparency helps,” said a founder who knows the firm, but hasn’t raised money from it, requesting anonymity.A fund of over $200 million would put Stellaris closer to Accel, Matrix, Lightspeed and Nexus Venture Partners- experienced VCs and among India’s top investors who have raised the largest VC funds in India- only second to Sequoia Capital.Accel and Nexus have both raised or are raising $450-500 million funds, while Matrix’s last fund was $300 million.","['Stellaris Venture Partners', 'Moneycontrol', 'Infosys', 'the World Bank’s International Finance Corporation', 'Limited Partners', 'Accel, Matrix, Lightspeed', 'Nexus Venture', 'Sequoia Capital', 'Nexus', 'Matrix’s']","['$150-160 million', '$90 million', '600', '$700 million', 'over $150 million', '$20 million', '30', '$150-160 million', 'over $200 million', '$450-500 million', '$300 million', '$275 million', '$400 million']"
"Exclusive| Indian Railway Finance Corp raises Rs 1,994 crore in June through 20-yr bonds",14 June,"In line with its plan to raise funds in excess of Rs 1 lakh crore in 2021-22 (Apr-Mar) for infrastructure development and implementation of various projects, the Indian Railway Finance Corp (IRFC) has raised Rs 1,994 crore through a 20-year bond at a coupon of 6.99 percent, sources told Moneycontrol. The issue was closed on June 2.The financing arm of the Indian Railways raised the money through an issue with a base size of Rs 1,000 crore, and a greenshoe option of Rs 5,000 crore, sources said. IRFC’s bonds are rated BBB-minus by Fitch Rating and AAA by CRISIL.The company's bonds have been in high demand following the central government's decision to boost spending on infrastructure projects to lead the country’s post-pandemic economic recovery.IRFC had, in March, raised Rs 1,375 crore through a 20-year bond issue at 6.8 percent, a rate of return lower than a government paper maturing in 2041, which offers an annualised yield of about 6.90 percent.IRFC may also provide funding for the Indian Railways' ambitious projects like the dedicated freight corridor and station redevelopment projects in New Delhi and Mumbai CST.COVID-19 VaccineFrequently Asked QuestionsA vaccine works by mimicking a natural infection. A vaccine not only induces immune response to protect people from any future COVID-19 infection, but also helps quickly build herd immunity to put an end to the pandemic. Herd immunity occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population becomes immune to a disease, making the spread of disease from person to person unlikely. The good news is that SARS-CoV-2 virus has been fairly stable, which increases the viability of a vaccine.There are broadly four types of vaccine — one, a vaccine based on the whole virus (this could be either inactivated, or an attenuated [weakened] virus vaccine); two, a non-replicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of SARS-CoV; three, nucleic-acid vaccines that have genetic material like DNA and RNA of antigens like spike protein given to a person, helping  human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine; and four, protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombinant proteins of SARS-COV-2 along with an adjuvant (booster) is given as a vaccine.Vaccine development is a long, complex process. Unlike drugs that are given to people with a diseased, vaccines are given to healthy people and also vulnerable sections such as children, pregnant women and the elderly. So rigorous tests are compulsory. History says that the fastest time it took to develop a vaccine is five years, but it usually takes double or sometimes triple that time.It is in talks with the National High Speed Rail Corporation Ltd to finance the extended portion of the Ahmedabad-Mumbai High Speed Rail Project.Funding plansIRFC is also looking to finance private players which have operational linkage with the Indian Railways.“As such, our memorandum of articles permits us to finance any sector which has forward or backward linkage with the Indian Railways, including ports and logistics for connectivity. We can fund the logistics sector, if it helps augmenting the freight-carrying capacity of Indian Railways. We are open to fund them,” IRFC Chairman and Managing Director Amitabh Banerjee had said earlier this year.The company is also in talks to provide funding for the privatisation of certain segments of the railways, including the operation of high-speed trains on certain routes.“With an investment of about Rs 30,000 crore, private players will procure their own rolling stock and run on these routes. Some of them have also approached us for financing the rolling stock because of the low-cost funding we provide,” Banerjee had said.The company's board has till now approved the raising of around Rs 65,300 crore in 2021-22 (Apr-Mar) through taxable bonds, tax-free bonds, government-guaranteed or serviced bonds, and securitisation of future lease receivables from railways, sources said.The company has been playing a critical role in the growth, expansion and modernisation of Indian Railways, and the Centre is expected to remain its largest client for at least the next 8-10 years because of the execution of the National Rail Plan, under which the government aims to spend Rs 10 lakh crore to augment capacities and improve infrastructure.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/exclusive-indian-railway-finance-corp-raises-rs-1994-crore-in-june-through-20-yr-bonds-7031341.html,Funding,"The good news is that SARS-CoV-2 virus has been fairly stable, which increases the viability of a vaccine.There are broadly four types of vaccine — one, a vaccine based on the whole virus (this could be either inactivated, or an attenuated [weakened] virus vaccine); two, a non-replicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of SARS-CoV; three, nucleic-acid vaccines that have genetic material like DNA and RNA of antigens like spike protein given to a person, helping  human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine; and four, protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombinant proteins of SARS-COV-2 along with an adjuvant (booster) is given as a vaccine.Vaccine development is a long, complex process.Some of them have also approached us for financing the rolling stock because of the low-cost funding we provide,” Banerjee had said.The company's board has till now approved the raising of around Rs 65,300 crore in 2021-22 (Apr-Mar) through taxable bonds, tax-free bonds, government-guaranteed or serviced bonds, and securitisation of future lease receivables from railways, sources said.The company has been playing a critical role in the growth, expansion and modernisation of Indian Railways, and the Centre is expected to remain its largest client for at least the next 8-10 years because of the execution of the National Rail Plan, under which the government aims to spend Rs 10 lakh crore to augment capacities and improve infrastructure.","['RNA', 'Banerjee', 'Indian Railways']",[]
"$300 million, 10 startups and a dream: Decoding the secretive Thrasio-model by Indian startups ",11 June,"The venture capitalist is mystified. He has seen half a dozen startups pitch to him and his partners at a top firm in the last month or two. That’s in addition to three newsbreaks from media outlets about similar startups, which piqued his interest. All these companies have a near-identical pitch. They want to acquire fast-growing online-first brands and build a portfolio of such brands. The parent company will bring in its technology, marketing chops and turbocharge the growth of the brands they acquire.This so-called Thrasio model has been doing the rounds in India’s startup and venture capital space in the last 2-3 months, with every top VC firm contemplating an investment or already having invested. “This is India’s next revolution in the consumer space. This is Flipkart in 2008, or Swiggy in 2015,” said one investor in such a firm. Until now, except their funding rounds- these companies’ plans and more importantly, challenges, have not been covered. The hype and secrecy around Thrasio-based models are contradictory yet tightly linked. At least three of these startups don’t even want their name in the market yet and their founders’ LinkedIn profiles say they work at a ‘stealth mode startup.’The hype is such that of the eight people Moneycontrol spoke to for this story- investors in these firms, investors making up their mind and entrepreneurs running them, not one could speak on the record. Some don’t want to be perceived as having doubts about this business (even though they actually do) while others are secretive about their plans in order to have a competitive advantage. They all requested anonymity.What is Thrasio? Thrasio, founded by Joshua Silberstein and Carlos Cashman in 2018, capitalises on two key  American trends- having a brand for everything, and brands scaling quickly on Amazon. The US has “a culture of brands,” one investor says. Many American brands relevant even today- Whirlpool, Brooks Brothers and Colgate, are hundreds of years old. Very few other countries have the sheer number of brands the US does. Many of them dominate nationally, some internationally. In the era of online brands, Thrasio buys the hottest up-and-coming brands which sell on Amazon and gives them the marketing, cost-optimisation and technological chops that Thrasio specialises in. It turbocharges growth for these profitable companies. In 2020, Thrasio generated $500 million in revenue and $100 million in profit- a word that eludes far bigger and well-known internet firms the world over. The three-year-old upstart was valued at $3 billion in February according to Bloomberg, and at $3.5 billion a month later, as per a person aware of the matter. Another similar firm, Perch, a Boston-based startup founded in late 2019, was valued at a billion dollars earlier this week, when SoftBank’s Vision Fund 2 led a $775 million Series A round. Perch is also profitable and operates over 70 brands.The people in playThis is the thesis that Mensa Brands, founded by former Myntra CEO Ananth Narayaan; GOAT Brand Labs, founded by Flipkart fashion head Rishi Vasudev; and at least six more startups have. Narayanan, Vasudev and FirstCry founder Supam Maheshwari have raised $150 million just between the three of them for this. Add to that Powerhouse91- backed by Snapdeal’s Kunal Bahl and Upscalio, founded by ex-Purplle Chief Marketing Officer Nitin Agarwal, both looking for money currently. Except Upscalio, other transactions have been reported by The Economic Times, The CapTable and Entrackr. Former Uber executive Utsav Agarwal co-founded 10 Club, another such firm along with Bhavna Suresh, former CEO of Philippines-based real estate marketplace Lamudi. Agarwal however left 10 Club to start competing player Evenflow, which is currently looking to raise $6-7 million.Many of these players have studied the market deeply. One person said Evenflow’s Agarwal has spoken to 400 Amazon sellers in the last six months, understanding their plans, processes, and potential to buy out. Each company has its own strategy, the proverbial ‘wine and dine’ before making a buyout pitch. Some offer unparalleled market expertise, others offer a ‘founder friendly’ relationship where the Amazon seller will still run the company, and some others promise that their companies- so far popular on Amazon but obscure otherwise- will get covered favourably by the media. One founder, while pitching to these sellers, keeps calling it a ‘partnership’, because he feels acquisition is a ruthless word and may rub a seller the wrong way. “If you can’t smoke a cigarette and have a cutting chai with these guys, there’s no way you can buy them,” one founder says.Yet, funding has been the main activity of this sector so far, and the actual work is only starting.“All these companies have raised rounds based on the first slide of their pitch deck. Nothing more. Now the real work begins. And I already don’t think more than 2-3 of these Thrasio-models will become big,” said an investor in one such startup.About $300 million is being invested across 8-10 such models in the next few months, and even as the race begins, not everyone is on equal footing. Some are already being written off by prospective investors.Market sizeOne investment banker says that the US has “hundreds of thousands of brands” and even the smallest of online brands generate a few million dollars in revenue. That sort of scale makes it perfect for Thrasio or Perch to acquire. India, on the other hand, has 10,000-15,000 brands in total, this banker says, and while a house of brands is certainly appealing, how many such houses can truly make it big- become multi-billion dollar companies- remains in question. Mensa, GOAT and the others are looking at brands across small and large sectors- fashion, apparel, home decor, arts and crafts, bedding, yoga mats, bedsheets, premium food items, kitchenware and more. India has about 100-110 million e-commerce users according to a 2020 Bain report. And while this is estimated to grow 30-35 percent year-on-year for the next decade, that will also depend on macroeconomic factors, particularly a rise in per capita income. Investors and entrepreneurs have been betting for years that India will be the next China- a bet that takes centre stage in a post-pandemic world, where India’s internet users are rising and China is thought to be a saturated market by many. Yet, 62 percent of China’s shoppers shopped online in 2019, compared to 11 percent in India. The market sizes are worlds apart as of now.“The Indian retail market is huge. The online market is relatively small. I think some of these brands may have to try an omnichannel strategy, because in India so far, online-only brands have not worked- unlike the US. Even Nykaa and Lenskart realised at some point that you have to go offline,"" said another investor in this space.Therein lies the conundrum. Many of these entrepreneurs and investors are betting on the power of the internet, the scale it provides and the consequent ability to generate profits. If these companies acquire offline-led brands, they may get a sliver of the large offline market, but it will be a deviation from the Thrasio strategy, which is internet-led. Founders are already realising this, and two founders Moneycontrol spoke to think they will have to buy a few offline brands a few years down the line to solve the market size issue.At the same time, other numbers tell a story. Last year, Amazon India said that it had 4,152 sellers with annual revenue of Rs 1 crore or more. If 10 Thrasio-model startups buy 15 brands each in the next 18 months, that would still be a small portfion of the overall sellers who are seeing scale on Flipkart and Amazon.Valuation- Beauty in the eyes of the beholderAll these startups could see their strategy succeed or evaporate depending on only one thing- the prices at which they acquire these sellers. These 8-10 startups are looking to acquire e-commerce sellers who have annual revenue of Rs 1-70 crore (some are aiming at Rs 1-10 crore, while others are eyeing Rs 5-50 crore). Founders say they want to pay about 4-5 times of Earnings Before Interest Taxes Depreciation and Amortisation (EBITDA), or 1.5 times of revenue. So a brand with Rs 10 crore of revenue and Rs 3 crore of EBITDA can be acquired for Rs 12 crore. This valuation is important. If instead of Rs 12 crore, it gets bought out for say Rs 20 crore, and 7 times EBITDA becomes the industry norm, these Thrasio-companies will be getting into deals at extremely expensive valuations, and even if the company grows say 10 times from there, its valuation may not be commensurate because now it will be valued at 3-4 times EBITDA or even less, since it has scaled and may not grow further. The valuation multiple shrinks and purely because of the entry price, an otherwise solid investment may not yield much.Investors are warning founders that a valuation fight may be down the road, and it may be hard to avoid. “Now all these players- GOAT, Mensa, etc are well funded and they all want the best, hottest brands. They all approach 10-15 of the best sellers, and because the seller is being courted by everyone, he can command his price. That’s where the problem starts,” one investor says.The future of these models will be determined by what price they buy brands at, and how they buy them- using equity or debt. For example, in Mensa’s $50 million round, a significant portion is debt, sources said. Narayanan declined to comment on the equity-debt breakup. Companies prefer using debt to fund acquisitions. Using share capital for buyouts results in founders diluting their stake more than needed and is less efficient.“All the companies are negotiating with venture debt firms or high-net-worth individuals for loans. How many of them are able to secure debt remains to be seen” one founder said. The takeawayNever before in the Indian startup scene have a whole host of companies in a single sector raised so much money only on promise. Neobanks in 2019 came close, but investment activity was not this broad-based. Incidentally, some of the neo banks such as Jupiter and Epi.fi are getting off the blocks only now, rolling out their platforms.These ‘house of brands’ are expected to rapidly buy online brands in the next year or so. One investor says that for the 2-3 most funded players, their next 2-3 rounds of funding each are already guaranteed. That could mean that more than half a billion dollars are poured into a promise. But if the dizzying growth and aspirations of their American, European and Latin American counterparts are any indication, these companies and their investors could be in for a wild ride.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/300-million-10-startups-and-a-dream-decoding-the-secretive-thrasio-model-by-indian-startups-7017471.html,Funding,"At least three of these startups don’t even want their name in the market yet and their founders’ LinkedIn profiles say they work at a ‘stealth mode startup.’The hype is such that of the eight people Moneycontrol spoke to for this story- investors in these firms, investors making up their mind and entrepreneurs running them, not one could speak on the record.If 10 Thrasio-model startups buy 15 brands each in the next 18 months, that would still be a small portfion of the overall sellers who are seeing scale on Flipkart and Amazon.Valuation- Beauty in the eyes of the beholderAll these startups could see their strategy succeed or evaporate depending on only one thing- the prices at which they acquire these sellers.","['’The', 'Moneycontrol', 'Flipkart', 'Amazon']","['$500 million', '$100 million', '$3 billion', '$3.5 billion', 'a billion dollars', '$775 million', '$150 million', '$6-7 million', 'About $300 million', 'a few million dollars', 'multi-billion dollar', '$50 million']"
Software startup Slintel raises $20 million led by GGV Capital,10 June,"Software startup Slintel said on June 10 that it has raised $20 million in a Series A round of funding led by GGV Capital- an investor in Airbnb, Slack and others.Its existing investors- Accel, Sequoia India and Stellaris Venture Partners also participated in the round.Founded by Deepak Anchala, Slintel helps companies make their sales and marketing efforts more efficient by helping analyse data which indicates who is more likely to be a customer. Slintel says it can be “the Robin to your Batman”, providing a company’s growth metrics, funding information, interests, tech stack, and thematic messaging to set up personalised account-based marketing campaigns.This is also Hang Tung-led GGV’s sixth bet on an Indian internet company after B2B marketplace Udaan, gold loans startup Rupeek, online learning firm Vedantu, digital ledger platform Khatabook and insurance firm Turtlemint.

Do you too struggle with maths or hate it? This startup wants to fix that,07 June,"After-school maths and coding firm Cuemath was started in 2013 by Manan Khurma, an Indian Institute of Technology (IIT)-Delhi graduate. His interest in mathematics led him to teach after college. Before Cuemath, Khurma founded Locus Education, a JEE test preparation venture in New Delhi which operated from January 2007 to December 2010.In December 2020, Cuemath raised $40 million in funding led by LGT Lightstone Aspada and Alpha Wave Incubation, valued at $170 million. The number doesn’t strike as significant at a time when online education has seen multiple billion-dollar firms increasing their valuation in record time. But Cuemath is trying to address the critical issue, perhaps one of the biggest in education -- of dealing with and understanding maths. Khurma speaks to Moneycontrol about addressing this issue, the company’s growth, overseas expansion and more.Why did you start Cuemath?I started Cuemath in 2013, and before that, I used to teach maths to high schoolers who were preparing for competitive exams like JEE. I realised that by the time the kids reach their senior grades, it is too late to have any fundamental impact on their learning outcome. I realised that you need to start much earlier for something like maths, so that was the genesis for Cuemath. Let's build a maths program with kids right from kindergarten onward and build a solid foundation for the kid. Today our program teaches you right from kindergarten all the way to grade 12. So the genesis was born out of my own experience; teaching all these students and releasing that foundation building is more important than test prep at the later stage.What you say is interesting because I'm not great at maths myself. I tell individuals that it isn't their fault. There are 2-3 points in a student's journey when they get averse to the subject or start hating it. For example, when you go from grade two to grade three, a lot of new concepts come in, or when you go from grade five to grade six, algebra comes in for the first time and grade eight to nine is another transition- maybe you started hating maths at one of those transition points.How did you know that maths is something you wanted to build a career in, and what piqued your interest in numbers and coding?My introduction to maths was different from how kids typically learn in school. My interest was partly driven by my parents, who were both university professors. They would bring these excellent books home, where I would read about very different ways to think about maths concepts. So that built my excitement, and I felt that it is very, very easy to master it if done the right way.Most kids struggle with permutation and combination. But if taught the right way, they can master it. Maths is such a fundamental and vital skill to know today- and not about the most valuable jobs like data science, Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Machine Learning (ML) which have maths at its core. If you want to do well in daily life, you have to be confident in maths to know basic concepts. It is becoming so important that we think of maths as a life skill, not just a subject.How much have you grown since the pandemic?COVID accelerated our growth dramatically. While I cannot get into specific revenue numbers, we did grow 3x over our previous fiscal's revenue. We expect to grow the same 3x during this fiscal year, so we have seen this tremendous growth during COVID, not just because all the kids went online. Our product has found attraction in the international market- like the US has become an enormous market for us, more than 50 percent of our revenue comes from outside India. Our ambition now is evident we want to win the global maths market. It is a very deep market, and we have the right kind of platform we have the suitable teacher base to be able to do that, so today we are present in more than 20 countries around the world, and within this year, we plan to be present in 50 countries.Other than the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, Dubai, Australia, France, Germany, Indonesia, Italy, the Netherlands, Sri Lanka, and Singapore, are there other countries you are targeting to expand into?We already have a solid presence in North America and Canada, and we have an upcoming presence in some European countries like Germany and Holland. We also have a strong presence in Singapore, Australia, and New Zealand. Even the Middle East is a large market. In the last few months, it has grown quite a lot for us, and we will be going more profound in the Middle East market. Every student in the world falls into our target market because maths is a universal need and maths is also common worldwide. Whatever kids in the US do, kids in India will do the same concepts. The school curriculum on maths is roughly the same worldwide, allowing us to take the same product, make minor tweaks and take it around the world.Is it true that maths in India is more advanced or more complex than that in western countries? Instead of complex, I would say that the approach of the curriculum is different. For example, if you look at the Singapore school curriculum, they have another way of covering maths concepts. The Indian curriculum has been a lot more abstract and focused on covering many topics more abstractly. It's not really that concepts are different like linear equations are the same in India and Singapore. But the focus may be different- like, in Singapore, it may be more applied. It is a different kind of practice in India, with varying types of testing that you will have to do. The US is very different; their core focuses on many applications, less abstract drill-based practice. We have always focused on a blend of application and practice; our curriculum has worked well in all countries. We tweak our curriculum to suit each country, but there is a common core. We do maths very visually, and that works everywhere.What sets your company apart from other companies in your market like WhiteHat Jr or Toppr, or Unacademy, among others?One is our razor-sharp focus on maths. We want to build the world's largest defining maths brand and win the global market. We are very clear about that, and hence we are not just focused on the Indian market. For companies like Unacademy or Toppr, they have been more focused on the Indian market. WhiteHat has gone out of the country, but they are doing much other stuff like coding and English; they are trying to create an umbrella of sorts. Our focus is very clear we want to be the maths brand of the world; because we are not building ten different products, our product becomes 10x better than everything else out there because we have an expert team that is focused on perfecting this one product. Maths is a universal need; it's not going anywhere, it's one thing that every kid around the world has to do, so it's not a niche market. It is the most significant component in the after-school ecosystem. Being focused on math with a visual curriculum sets us apart from everyone out there.Don't kids get confused between what they learn in school and what their teachers teach? There is a possibility that the kids will get confused because they are learning everything to be memorised. Let's say your teacher teaches you a sure way to add fractions in school and your tuition teacher teaches you another way to do the same, but you don't get the reason for the underlying approach, so that you will get confused with two different methods. If you understand the underlying logic, for example, half plus one by four, why is it three by four and not something else? If you understand that visually, you will see both approaches as two ways of doing the same thing, and then you won't get confused.Our goal is to give the kid that firm grounding, understanding, and reasoning instead of having them memorise a factor or a formula. I'll give you an example; let's say one by two is half, or 0.5 or 50 percent, one is a fraction, one is a decimal, and one is a percentage. They are the same quantity, but most grade six kids will not connect because they will learn fractions, decimals, and percentages in different chapters. So for them, these are three other things to be done, but a Cuemath kid will say all these are the same; these are the equivalent representation of the same quantity; hence they will find all three topics very easy. So that is our difference; we focus on the underlying logic, so the kids learn everything visually, making it very easy and fun for the kids.What's your next phase of growth? Coding is an extension of maths. We do coding because we don't want students to get some superficial exposure and then forget about it; we want them to build a deep mastery of computational thinking. Coding projects also have math embedded because we think of coding as an extension of mathematical thinking. Similarly, we want to do data science for kids, so we want to build a platform that teaches kids skills with math at their core. On the expansion front, we want to go from 20 to 50 countries and want to go deeper into the existing markets that we are already operating in; outside India, the US and the Middle East are becoming our biggest markets. We want to build a more substantial brand reach in these geographies.What challenges does Cuemath face today, given the current online-only environment?  The pandemic has disrupted the education industry, with ed-tech players witnessing the transition as well. We had planned to move from physical classes to online classes in 2018, so the process during the pandemic was seamless. However, we have not faced a challenge as our classes continue to be live, i.e., there is a 1:1 teacher-student interaction instead of a pre-recorded level. This way, we ensure that we understand the child's progress and, in the process, adapt the curriculum to their learning pace. The Cuemath platform AI has been designed this way, which benefits the child.This teaching methodology has seen our product grow from strength to strength.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/startup/do-you-too-struggle-with-maths-or-hate-it-this-startup-wants-to-fix-that-6994191.html,Funding,"For example, when you go from grade two to grade three, a lot of new concepts come in, or when you go from grade five to grade six, algebra comes in for the first time and grade eight to nine is another transition- maybe you started hating maths at one of those transition points.How did you know that maths is something you wanted to build a career in, and what piqued your interest in numbers and coding?My introduction to maths was different from how kids typically learn in school.It is a very deep market, and we have the right kind of platform we have the suitable teacher base to be able to do that, so today we are present in more than 20 countries around the world, and within this year, we plan to be present in 50 countries.Other than the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, Dubai, Australia, France, Germany, Indonesia, Italy, the Netherlands, Sri Lanka, and Singapore, are there other countries you are targeting to expand into?We already have a solid presence in North America and Canada, and we have an upcoming presence in some European countries like Germany and Holland.",[],"['$40 million', '$170 million', 'multiple billion-dollar']"
Inequity in tech hiring: The big pay-cheque culture could soon put Indian startups in a tight spot,06 June,"Issues related to hiring and human resource management in the technology sector have been generating quite a lot of buzz of late on social media, founder forums and the like. A recent article in Moneycontrol, which highlighted the case of a 32-year-old tech professional in India bagging a Rs 2-crore pay cheque, the equivalent of a typical Silicon Valley Startup salary, underscored the growing inequities in access to tech talent in the country.The situation, however, is far from black and white. On the one hand, you have startups kitted out with new funding, paying freshers and young engineers three times more than the market standard. On the other hand, you have employment numbers in a free fall. We witness writers, designers, lawyers, and freelancers from different fields constantly calling out on social media for employment opportunities. What we need is a systemic approach to creating sustainable hiring and employment practices in the tech sector.First, we need to address the startup funding boom. The year 2020-21 certainly feels like the decade of the Indian startups, going from record new companies being formed to building from India for the world, or from India for India. While it's exciting and heartening to see all the progress, one can't ignore the unsustainable hiring practices of young companies. What happens to your company when you've spent all your VC money on 2-3x market rate for the early employees you hire? What happens to your employees who are left without a job at the end of that cycle and with a salary expectation wildly above market standards for their experience? Booms and busts happen in a cycle. This is why following standard sustainable hiring practices allows you to ride through both in a stable manner, with eyes on continuous long-term growth. There are and will always be edge cases to this. Companies growing at an exponential pace will need to do what it takes to acquire talent rapidly, at any cost, where the math works out long term thanks to how sound the business is.Also read: Zerodha co-founders Nithin and Nikhil Kamath to get Rs 100 crore annual salaryTalent crunchSecond, tech startups need talent for marketing, sales, products, operations, finance, creative disciplines and more. In India, there is a severe glut in many of these non-engineering, non-programming, humanities-centric skills. To fuel rapid growth, startups can double down on hiring these skill sets from a variety of other fields including journalism, consulting and the professional services industries, where the downside is that the talent available is plenty but often not centred around modern technology. On the upside, this talent comes with fantastic domain knowledge. Startups are likely to find people with excellent experience and knowledge in insurance, finance, real estate, law and many more fields. Young companies should actively look to hire from this pool that is typically paid much below the market rate in the tech sector.Also read: Startups pay record salaries to all talent amid funding boomThird, young companies should be relentless in creating training programmes that allow the talent described above to get onboarded into the tech industry. This creates a snowball effect. Once you've cracked hiring from a set of non-traditional domains and their transition into tech, you are tapping into an entirely new pool of talent that is largely undiscovered and underpaid, with the upskilling trump card.Be diverse, inclusive Fourth, focus on diversity and inclusion. Women are leaving the workforce at alarming numbers. The tech sector is notorious for its anti-women and anti-LGBTQ culture. One could extend this argument to an extreme to say it's pro-men for the most part. If you are a startup and you disagree with these comments, perhaps you can focus on the lack-of-talent-access problem you are facing and acknowledge the large pool of 'resources' we have in the country, in women and LGBTQ communities. Create programmes that require hiring women back to work after long maternity breaks. Create programmes focused on requiring mandatory diversity in hiring. Diversity and merit are not mutually exclusive. There are plenty of women and LGBTQ folks in the country who are highly skilled and with the right toolkit, upskilling and programmes can grow the tech-enabled talent pool in the country.Also read: Zerodha founders’ salary: Let’s cut through the noiseWhen hiring, cast the net wideLast but not the least, IITs and IIMs are not the only talent beds in our country. As a founder, I came back to Chennai from San Francisco in the last decade, seeking the talent bed, that is Tamil Nadu. From Coimbatore to Madurai to Chennai, we've built a world-class team of AI experts at MadStreetDen, fast expanding into Bangalore, Mumbai, Pune and many other cities. You can too if you focus on hiring and upskilling freshers from across the country. I would go a tad bit far with this argument to state that sometimes, this in itself, is an advantage to young startups. Companies such as TCS, Freshworks and many others have created long-lasting playbooks with this approach. As founders, we all share the responsibility of growing talent and growing with talent, creating sustainable talent ecosystems in the countries where we operate.The issue we face today is not as much an issue of rising salaries for coders, as much as an issue of inequities in opportunities for young talent to upskill, grow and be a relevant and significant part of the tech ecosystem.(The author is the founder & CEO of Mad Street Den, a computer vision and artificial intelligence company. Ashwini returned to India from Silicon Valley after more than a decade to bootstrap her startup that she founded with her husband, Anand Chandrasekaran, a neuroscientist. )",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/startup/inequity-in-tech-hiring-the-big-pay-cheque-culture-could-soon-put-indian-startups-in-a-tight-spot-6994041.html,Funding,"There are plenty of women and LGBTQ folks in the country who are highly skilled and with the right toolkit, upskilling and programmes can grow the tech-enabled talent pool in the country.Also read: Zerodha founders’ salary: Let’s cut through the noiseWhen hiring, cast the net wideLast but not the least, IITs and IIMs are not the only talent beds in our country.As founders, we all share the responsibility of growing talent and growing with talent, creating sustainable talent ecosystems in the countries where we operate.The issue we face today is not as much an issue of rising salaries for coders, as much as an issue of inequities in opportunities for young talent to upskill, grow and be a relevant and significant part of the tech ecosystem.",[],[]
Artha Venture Fund closes debut micro VC fund at Rs 220 crore,04 June,"Early stage investor Artha Venture Fund said on June 4 that it has closed its debut early stage fund of Rs 220 crore, which plans to invest in 28 promising startups in the next two years.Artha, founded by angel investor Anirudh Damani has been raising the fund since 2018, and its closure indicates the growing demand for venture capital of all sizes for Indian entrepreneurs.Investors in the fund include high net worth individuals who invested between Rs 2-5 crore and family offices that have invested Rs 5-15 crore apiece. Other backers of the fund include Artha India Ventures, the family office of Ashok Kumar Damani and Ramesh M Damani, and Singularity Ventures, the family office of Madhusudan Kela who formerly served as a chief investment strategist at Reliance Capital.“The family offices serve a key role. Many of them can do follow-on rounds in our companies and we get a lot of deal flow by references from these offices,” founder and managing partner Damani told Moneycontrol.Damani’s angel investments include hotelier Oyo Rooms, software firm Exotel and makeup brand Purplle. The fund’s prominent investments include space tech startup Agnikul, peer-to-peer lending firm LenDenClub, and vending machine startup Daalchini. Artha's portfolio currently has an annual revenue run rate of Rs 150 crore, Damani said.From the first fund, Artha plans to invest in 40 companies, of which 12 are done and five are in the pipeline. The firm generally invests Rs 1.5-3 crore as its first cheque for 15% in a startup and invests Rs 4 crore and 8 crore more in the following rounds if the company is promising.About 65-70% of its total fund will be invested in 10 of the best 40 companies, doubling down on its winners.“The effect of the two pandemic-led lockdowns shook our portfolio founders and our team. However, each one stuck to their task, and our founders responded to each obstacle as an opportunity. As a result, our portfolio-wide revenues grew 3x in 12 months without raising additional capital. This frugal but explosive growth is what excites us and our investors,” Damani said. Artha’s stage of seed investing has also become increasingly competitive as founder-turned angels, micro VCs, angel networks, and accelerators all want to get into the hottest startups as early as possible. Another micro fund WEH Ventures said earlier this week that it plans to raise a Rs 100 crore second fund.However this also means that some of these accelerators work in tandem with funds, become a feeder for them, and micro VCs become a feeder for larger well-heeled venture funds. The Indian startup ecosystem is going through an unprecedented funding boom, but Damani said at Artha’s stage of investing, deals still don’t seem too expensive, and have stayed at roughly the same rate for the last couple of years. “We will continue to scout for seed-stage deals in our preferred investment themes of direct to consumer (D2C), D2C enablers, and business-to-business (B2B). Another sleeping giant that has piqued our interest in the last 12 months is the gaming sector, especially for the masses,” Damani said.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/startup/artha-ventures-closes-debut-micro-vc-fund-at-rs-220-crore-6985331.html,Funding,"Early stage investor Artha Venture Fund said on June 4 that it has closed its debut early stage fund of Rs 220 crore, which plans to invest in 28 promising startups in the next two years.Artha, founded by angel investor Anirudh Damani has been raising the fund since 2018, and its closure indicates the growing demand for venture capital of all sizes for Indian entrepreneurs.Investors in the fund include high net worth individuals who invested between Rs 2-5 crore and family offices that have invested Rs 5-15 crore apiece.The firm generally invests Rs 1.5-3 crore as its first cheque for 15% in a startup and invests Rs 4 crore and 8 crore more in the following rounds if the company is promising.About 65-70% of its total fund will be invested in 10 of the best 40 companies, doubling down on its winners.“The effect of the two pandemic-led lockdowns shook our portfolio founders and our team.",['Artha Venture Fund'],[]
Exclusive: OfBusiness eyes unicorn club with SoftBank funding at $1.5b valuation,02 June,"SoftBank Vision Fund is in talks to lead a $100-150 million round in lending ecommerce startup OfBusiness, valuing it at  over $1.5 billion, making it a unicorn in a record breaking year for startup funding and continuing the Japanese investor’s recent dealmaking spree, sources said.OfBusiness, founded in 2015 by former McKinsey executive and venture capitalist Asish Mohapatra, lends via a non-banking finance company (NBFC) to small and medium enterprises which have a turnover between Rs 20-200 crore.It lends by  providing raw material- which the company would use the money to buy anyway- in addition to just capital and offers a credit line at an interest rate of 1.5% per month. The company claims SMEs get the best price for their raw material requirements via OfBusiness’s bidding platform. Its technology platform negotiates with more than 100 manufacturers and suppliers across India to get best guarantee prices on structural steel, polymer, paper and cement.$1.5 billion will be nearly double OfBusiness' last valuation of $800 million when it raised $110 million led by Falcon Edge Capital two months ago. The company’s growth has been driven by its business-to-business e-commerce model in addition to its original lending model. It had a revenue of Rs 400 crore per month only from the ecommerce business, where it sells steel, cement and fabrication materials, among other things.OfBusiness and SoftBank declined to comment on Moneycontrol’s queries.In the current round, early investor Matrix Partners India also plans to sell a part of its stake, pocketing $30-40 million cash, although this hasn't been finalised yet. Matrix currently owns about 16-17%, sources said. Its other investors include Norwest Venture Partners and Creation Investments.“During the pandemic, their loan book doubled and the commerce business tripled. Raw material financing from intermediaries is expensive and large cement companies don’t give credit. They also have minimum order quantities which small businesses can’t fulfill,” said a person aware of the matter, requesting anonymity.“They have built a sizable business without burning money. They want to go public in 3 years and it can be a great outcome for SoftBank,” the person added.OfBusiness said in April that it has a gross merchandise value  (GMV) run rate of $1.5 billion and a profit before tax run rate of $20 million. Run rate means a particular month’s numbers multiplied by twelve (annualised).OfBusiness has also raised $200 million in debt so far from its lending partners including IDFC First Bank, SBI,HDFC and Swiss firm ResponsAbility among others.While small business lending has seen dozens of companies emerge from India- many private equity backed and some listed- selling cement and other industrial goods online has also incited investor interest in recent times. In its B2B ecommerce business, OfBusiness somewhat competes with Infra.Market, which was valued at a billion dollars earlier this year, raising $100 million from Tiger Global Management.OfBusiness and Infra.Market target similar customers, but Business is selling larger quantities and is operating in bigger categories than Infra.market, which is running a private label to sell stone materials, concrete, and walling solutionsSoftBank, after a relatively quiet 2020 in the aftermath of the pandemic and coworking firm WeWork’s implosion is back with a bang, and has committed over a billion dollars in India just in the last quarter.

"Becoming unicorn doesn’t mean much, want to grow 200-300 times from here: Urban Company CEO Abhiraj Bhal",02 June,"Home services firm Urban Company on April 27 was valued at $2 billion, when it raised $255 million from Prosus Ventures (Naspers), Dragoneer, and Wellington Management, with participation from Vy Capital, Tiger Global, and Steadview Capital. The deal came up in regulatory filings. It was a big deal by most accounts, but Urban Company did not announce the deal or talk to the media about it, being busy dealing with the horrific second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic in India.More than a month on, co-founder and CEO Abhiraj Bhal is seeing shoots of recovery. He is convinced that customers ordering home services online is a long-term trend and here to stay, not a pandemic-forced temporary shift in behavior, like some suspect. He bases all his decisions on this conviction. In an interview with Moneycontrol’s M. Sriram and Chandra R. Srikanth over Zoom, he talks about dealing with the pandemic, bouncing back, expansion plans, and why becoming a unicorn- celebrated by many startups- does not mean much to him. Over the last few weeks, you have been sharing initiatives by Urban Company, in light of the second wave of Covid19. Have things got better compared to where we were towards the end of April/the first week of May?The second wave has been very unprecedented in its scale and magnitude and I don't think any organization in India has been left untouched by it. All of us have suffered significantly both in a personal capacity as well as in our organizations. At Urban Company from the onset of the wave from March onwards, our entire focus became how we can help our partners, customers, and our internal employees. For customers, the whole focus became around safety. We had a lot of learnings from the last wave and throughout the pandemic, several initiatives that we took and didn't stop. Around PPE kits, to ensure they are well stocked with masks, face shield, coveralls, etc. We ensured that partners are continuously tested. We have kicked off a nationwide vaccination campaign. In the next 3-4 days, 50 percent of our service partners will have got the first jab and by the end of June, we expect 75-80 percent of our partners to get one. The last 20 percent is always hard because people may have hesitancy or may have been recovering from Covid. This is at a base of 35,000 partners. It is a sizable effort and we are paying this free of cost to our service partners. We are also showing this as a live status on the app. If you go to the app you can see how many partners in your city have been vaccinated and whether the partner assigned to you has been vaccinated. The second effort that we have put in place for partners is a broad-based Covid help program where we are providing immediate financial assistance to partners in lockdown districts to medical assistance to help with insurance. We also have a bereavement support program. Many of them are almost frontline so vaccination drives are very critical to taking care of them. The third constituent is our employees- we put together a task force that has been working around the clock to help with testing hospitalization to oxygen. All our employees and their families are getting vaccinated by Urban Company. We have also announced efforts around unlimited sick leaves and mental health. What has the last year been like? There must have been many ups and downs. And what does the next phase of growth look like? The last year in many ways has been very transformational for the company and an inflection point for the company. In terms of scale, as of March before the covid wave, we were almost 2x of the pre-covid peak. Even after the lockdown last year, when business came to a screeching halt, it bounced back very rapidly. By October, we were at 140% of pre-Covid peak and by March we were at 2X of the pre-Covid peak. And we were seeing very rapid acceleration. April and May have seen a little bit of a dent but nothing like last year.  With each cycle, we are becoming more efficient. We are confident that the business will already hit March levels in June-July and from there it will rapidly take off.  Consumers are looking to avail home services more seriously. Post the wave, there is this surge of consumers who want to get things done for personal grooming and home needs. They naturally rely on a safer, more organised option, rather than a local option. You will naturally see this in your own behavior. For the next few months, if you want a beauty treatment, going out is not going to come naturally for some time. Similarly, if you call someone for home repair, you want to know whether he’s been vaccinated if he’s wearing a PPE kit. There is a quality control mechanism in place. As the second wave abates, we have already seen an uptick due to this reason. We have to do a lot of work to keep up with the demand. There is an opportunity for market share to shift from offline to online. The offline world has been hit and can't be aggressive and capitalise on the opportunity the way we will. In terms of geography, before the pandemic started, we were only in 10 cities. Now we are in 30 cities. Outside India, before the pandemic, we were in one international city (Dubai). Today we are in 7 cities. India will go from 30-50 cities by the end of the calendar year and 100 by 2022 end. People are trusting us a lot more. Folks who would otherwise have not used us, are using us now. Earlier it was limited to young professionals, young couples, a little more new age. Now we see older people use us- getting haircuts, getting homes disinfected, etc. I think we are at that point where we are breaking through, from being a useful app for some to being a mass app for home needs for India at large. It is completely up to us to capture it. There is competition, there always will be, both offline and online, but so far we have been able to do well, and now it is up to us how we capitalise. What is giving you the confidence that this trend will continue? Even considering the third wave, at some point won't people resort to using offline players more?Future predictions are always hard but we always focus on what is in our control. I’m particularly confident that there is a broad-based behavior change that all of us are seeing, which was not just pandemic driven. That behavior change was happening pre-pandemic too. The change was- “Get things to me” rather than “Me going for things”'. People want their home to be the point of consumption and things to come to them. I’ll watch a movie on Netflix rather than go to the theatre. I’ll order home rather than go to a restaurant. Very similarly, for a haircut or beauty appointment or a massage, I was ordering these things in. And this was happening before the pandemic. The pandemic accelerated this behavior, and this is a long-lived pandemic, not a short-lived one. So that is only accelerating and cementing this trend. Consumers using online platforms as their primary option is a trend that's here to stayAnd what impact has growth had on your finances? For FY20 you had revenue of Rs 263 crore and a loss of Rs 155 crore. Will your economics improve? What does FY21 and further look like?No comment.There is a trend among Urban Company service partners, to acquire a customer and then encourage them to contact the service partner directly, rather than going via UC and thus making it cheaper. How do you view this? Is it a threat to growth?It happens a little bit but is not a common behavior And we don’t stop this behavior. Partners are welcome to try it, and most of the time they will realise that they are the ones losing in the bargain. See, the pricing power that comes to the platform doesn’t come to them directly offline. There is no haggling around the price on the platform. And the consumer isn’t just counting 20% of UC’s commission and deducting that. It is a slippery slope. He will tell the delivery partner to do it much more cheaply. So one is, just from a monetary perspective the partner loses out. Two, their respect goes away. A lot of people tell us that when they go as a UC professional, they get a lot of respect from the security guard and the customers. There is also inherent safety baked in. and on our platform, last-minute rescheduling and cancelations don’t happen (as in, the customer is not refunded if it does happen).In the offline world, the customer says, “Come at 9 am”. Then at 8:45, he will say, “Boss, actually I’m going jogging now. You come at 10 please.” Now the consumer doesn’t realise that for that poor guy, that one hour is gone. He is not going to be able to find another gig on the fly in 15 minutes. The customer will pay him only for the one hour he uses, not for the one hour the partner loses, right?There’s the training we do, subscriptions, insurance for partners, personal loans. Sometimes partners will try, out of sheer curiosity. But mostly they realise it is not worth their time and energy. And actually, those who try and then realise, they are the ones who become the most loyal.That said, this is India, it happens all the time. But we are keeping enough value levers on both sides of the platform. Even consumers realise that offline you won't get the same professionalism. He may cut corners, he may not be on time. Lastly Abhiraj, what does this unicorn milestone mean to you? And now that you have built this platform with so many partners, what sort of adjacencies do you see?I think it's a very small milestone that is a long and hopefully fulfilling journey the company will see in the next 10-20 years. I would want Urban Company to grow 200-300 times from here in my lifetime, and so in that journey, this is maybe the first milestone in a 42-mile marathon race.

Startups pay record salaries to all talent amid funding boom,02 June,"Indian Internet startups are paying record salaries to junior and senior employees across functions, led by the startup funding boom gripping the country.While salaries for coders and developers have shot through the roof over the last few years, other functions including marketing, sales, human resources and communications are now attracting two or three times the money the same roles attracted a couple of years ago.Leaders of these functions are especially able to command outsized salaries and stock options, while rank and file employees are also seeing average salaries rise due to the funding boom.For instance, an edtech firm is in the process of hiring a performance marketing head. This 32-year-old executive is expected to earn about Rs 1.5-2 crore, with Rs 50 lakh of stock options, compared to a previous salary of Rs 75 lakhs at a consumer conglomerate.The hiring boom and high salaries are closely linked to the funding frenzy and are more a sign of the future promise these companies hold, rather than their present financial performance. India has seen 14 unicorns- startups valued at a billion dollars or more- in five months of 2021, compared to 11 in all of 2020.Online education, fintech, software as a service, ecommerce and technology-led startups are leading the hiring brigade. Other startups such as logistics firms and consumer brands are hiring as well, but despite better economics and significantly higher revenue, are not paying through the nose for senior level hires.Steadily growing online brands with Rs 400 crore annual revenue are paying Rs 50-60 lakhs for a function leader, while new age firms which are growing 100 percent month-on-month but have negligible revenue are paying crores for function leaders.""Non-tech non-product salaries are also catching up today. We are seeing significant hikes while hiring senior people for brand, marketing, growth, acquisitions. It is pure demand and supply at play, there are very few people who've really driven 100x journeys in the Indian startup ecosystem,” said Mihir Gupta, co-founder and CEO of Lightspeed-backed Teachmint, which provides a software platform for offline classes to go online.Some startup employees are now measuring their salaries in dollars and benchmarking it against Silicon Valley salaries, where they could have potentially worked. ""Indian startups are raising money at par with global startups, building products of global standards and competing for global markets. It makes natural sense to compensate talent as well as per global benchmarks to the extent it is feasible,” Gupta said.Startup founders know from their experience as well as that of their peers and seniors that key hires have moved the needle for successful companies. Early to growth stage firms also prioritise speed above all else, and pay a worthy candidate handsomely, although if they were to search for a month more, they would find someone for the same role who would take half this person’s salary, founders say.“When money is available and speed matters, you pay up and hire the best person. You may find a great person at a lower cost two months later, but what about the growth compromised for those months? Or what if your competition scoops up better people and blazes forward?,” said the founder of an early stage firm, requesting anonymity.Jitendra Gupta, founder and CEO of neobank Jupiter says that salaries across functions, even for younger employees, have risen at least 25 percent in the last two years. A junior sales executive with 3-4 years of experience used to earn Rs 18-20 lakh annually two years ago. This has now gone up to Rs 30 lakh per annum.“Many unicorns are not sensitive to the cost. A lot of candidates we have made offers to already had a couple of offers. The hiring cost has gone up for any skill set,” Gupta said.Full stack developers as young as 25-26 years old are earning close to Rs 1 crore, some much more. The pay hikes that coders are getting is also causing an internal rift at some startups, where experienced executives in functions like finance, sales or supply chain feel shortchanged, earning less despite having worked for many more years.Founders are having to explain to these executives that their role is different, and that technology teams will always be paid more because it is a core function, and one where talent is the hardest to find. Further, technology can be the backbone of an organisation and help increase the company’s gross margins later on. Technology inherently demands an upfront investment- on software and people, on which the returns are manifold.Even if executives in offline heavy functions like supply chain or finance were to demand the same salary as a star engineer, it may not make sense because the financial returns these functions provide could be small compared to what superior technology can provide, founders say.To ensure harmony at startups and not cause a cultural rift, founders and human resources leaders are correcting salaries across the organisation, so that one team isn’t exorbitantly paid while another languishes with measly hikes. Salary Differences will still exist but they will be more sensible.Giving generous hikes to incoming candidates also poses a risk of poor culture, where employees feel jumping jobs is the only way to secure a big pay hike and that internal pay hikes won't be commensurate.""If the remaining 100 employees make less money compared to the last incremental hire, it will create a lot of dissatisfaction for those who have been loyal but are at lower salaries. This kind of salary correction should happen in a way that there is no parity problem,” said TN Hari, human resources head at online grocer BigBasket“You can't have a situation where people who switch company to company, the job hoppers get high salaries while people who are competent and loyal are at lower salaries. So, startups have to do this in a very thoughtful manner,” he added.A few founders and investors worry about the long-term impact of these salary hikes. Many of these executives are being paid many times their salary from a few years ago, for doing largely the same work they did 2-3 years ago.All these salaries are paid under best case scenarios that all these companies become multi-billion dollar firms. But if that does not happen, it is unclear how these salaries will look then, and whether they will be sustainable, more so when the funding environment changes. But most people say they can't afford to think that far ahead, when if they don't hire certain people who come at a certain price, their companies’ future may be bleak.""Honestly, capital is not the biggest moat anymore. People are. So you have to invest in this moat because these people will take you to your company's next milestone. And that's all that matters at that point,” Teachmint’s Gupta says.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/companies/startups-pay-record-salaries-to-all-talent-amid-funding-boom-6975191.html,Funding,"Indian Internet startups are paying record salaries to junior and senior employees across functions, led by the startup funding boom gripping the country.While salaries for coders and developers have shot through the roof over the last few years, other functions including marketing, sales, human resources and communications are now attracting two or three times the money the same roles attracted a couple of years ago.Leaders of these functions are especially able to command outsized salaries and stock options, while rank and file employees are also seeing average salaries rise due to the funding boom.For instance, an edtech firm is in the process of hiring a performance marketing head.Technology inherently demands an upfront investment- on software and people, on which the returns are manifold.Even if executives in offline heavy functions like supply chain or finance were to demand the same salary as a star engineer, it may not make sense because the financial returns these functions provide could be small compared to what superior technology can provide, founders say.To ensure harmony at startups and not cause a cultural rift, founders and human resources leaders are correcting salaries across the organisation, so that one team isn’t exorbitantly paid while another languishes with measly hikes.",[],"['a billion dollars', 'multi-billion dollar']"

Billion-dollar valuation on $10 million revenue: Decoding SoftBank’s unique bet on Zeta,25 May,"SoftBank, the Japanese investment giant, invested $250 million in banking software firm Zeta this week, valuing it at $1.45 billion. At a time when India’s unicorn frenzy seems to be touching new highs, and huge funding rounds seem the new normal, it is easy to dismiss it as another large deal. But a few factors make Zeta a fascinating bet for SoftBank, and arguably its most unique in India so far.Six-year-old Zeta wants banking apps to provide a seamless experience — deposits, loans, bill tracking and card payments — services which banks currently provide on clunky apps and sometimes only offline.  In its six years so far, it has earned a revenue of $10 million, said two people aware of the matter, requesting anonymity. Most of this revenue also comes from a single client — Sodexo, the French food services and facilities company, which uses Zeta to process its payments. Zeta declined to comment on the revenue.The $1.45 billion valuation looms large over Zeta when other software startups from India have similar valuations with at least $30-50 million in revenue and dozens of clients. People close to Zeta say that it has to be evaluated slightly differently from regular software-as-a-service (SaaS) firms, which have boomed in India recently. Zeta, co-founded and led by serial entrepreneur Bhavin Turakhia, has been built unlike most other software startups in India. It has raised no money from external investors barring Sodexo, and even Turakhia’s previous businesses — messaging platform Flock, advertising firm Media.net and website aggregator Directi — haven’t raised money from external investors. Turakhia and his brother Divyank have netted over a billion dollars combined by selling Media.net and Directi in the last twenty years.While Zeta has miniscule revenue currently and is not profitable, it is projecting a revenue of $250-300 million in the next three years, people familiar with the matter said. It plans to generate this revenue by providing its banking software to financial institutions all over the world. It already has partnerships with banks in the Philippines, Italy, Bangladesh, and Spain, in addition to a tie-up in the US and Brazil. In India, Zeta says its customers include HDFC Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Axis Bank, IndusInd Bank, Yes Bank and RBL Bank. However, Moneycontrol understands that most of its contracts with customers in India and abroad haven’t generated revenue yet, and revenue so far has been mainly from Sodexo.SoftBank is then effectively betting on these partnerships and contracts which haven’t fructified into money yet, but whose terms state that if Zeta does power these banking platforms all over the world, it could earn Zeta hundreds of millions. This is unlike any other bet from SoftBank India, or any other late-stage investor, whereby the time they are a billion-dollar company, they have dozens of companies who use their product and pay for it.“Zeta is a different bet for SoftBank because the average value of an individual contract is far higher than your regular SaaS company,” said the person cited above.“Your regular SaaS company can get $3-4 million from one company in the US. Zeta can get more than $50 million from a single bank. So SoftBank’s bet is that if Zeta can do this even for a dozen clients (and they want to do it for 300), they will have enough revenue to justify a multibillion-dollar valuation,” the person added.In an interview with Moneycontrol, Turakhia acknowledged that the nature of his contracts is different from most other software firms. “That would be a very correct way of looking at it. In fact, I think at scale in the next 5-7 years, I would say the majority of our revenue would come from say 30-40 clients and some of the contracts can be worth $50-100 million at a time. Fully scaling may take 5 years but we are targeting top 300 banks in the world and each contract is worth a sizable chunk in revenue,” he said.Zeta is SoftBank’s second SaaS bet in India, after it led a $100 million round in Mindtickle last year, valuing it at $500 million. The deal just about pre-empted the SaaS boom underway in public and private markets globally. It is a far more conservative bet than Zeta, investors say. While Mindtickle has many customers and stable revenue every month, Zeta is shooting for the stars, wanting to disrupt banking software- an area that has not seen innovation in at least two decades.“Zeta’s valuation should also be seen in terms of what they are building and in terms of overall demand. SoftBank would have loved to do the deal at half the valuation (of $1.45b) but given Bhavin’s experience and the promise of the product, a premium on valuation is expected,” said another person aware of discussions, requesting anonymity.Zeta’s ambitions are also similar to Marqeta, a US-based firm which provides payments infrastructure to companies. Marqeta provides debit and credit cards to company employees, expense management, and a backend for digital banks. Marqeta’s revenue in 2020 doubled to $290 million, and it is eyeing a $10 billion public listing this year. Large investors such as SoftBank take a portfolio approach, where each individual investment carries a different level of risk (with the caveat that technology investing carries some inherent risk). Investors hope that 5-10 years after these investments are made, on an aggregate level the risk makes sense and provides a return of 3-4 times on the total invested capital.SoftBank India’s recent investments in logistics firm Delhivery, eyewear retailer Lenskart and Mindtickle have been more on the conservative side, compared to riskier and high-flying bets such as financial services firm Paytm and hotelier Oyo. But in Zeta, SoftBank has made a unique bet, at a valuation that seems bloated by general revenue metrics. However, the huge market that Zeta is addressing, its experienced founder and the funding frenzy gripping Indian startups provide more context to the valuation, and hence make it unique.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/startup/billion-dollar-valuation-on-10m-revenue-decoding-softbanks-unique-bet-on-zeta-6936501.html,Funding,"Turakhia and his brother Divyank have netted over a billion dollars combined by selling Media.net and Directi in the last twenty years.While Zeta has miniscule revenue currently and is not profitable, it is projecting a revenue of $250-300 million in the next three years, people familiar with the matter said.This is unlike any other bet from SoftBank India, or any other late-stage investor, whereby the time they are a billion-dollar company, they have dozens of companies who use their product and pay for it.“Zeta is a different bet for SoftBank because the average value of an individual contract is far higher than your regular SaaS company,” said the person cited above.“Your regular SaaS company can get $3-4 million from one company in the US.","['Divyank', 'Media.net', 'Zeta', 'SoftBank']","['$250 million', '$1.45 billion', '$10 million', '$1.45 billion', 'at least $30-50 million', 'over a billion dollars', '250', 'hundreds of millions', 'billion-dollar', '$3-4 million', 'more than $50 million', 'multibillion-dollar', '$50-100 million', '$100 million', '$500 million', '1.45b', '$290 million', '$10 billion']"

Fintech startups raised record $22.8 billion in Q1 2021: Report,11 May,"Fintech firms globally raised a record $22.8 billion in the first quarter of 2021, more than double the previous quarter, according to a report from CB Insights, a data platform.Fintechs raised $22.8 billion across 614 deals, compared to $10.8 billion across 560 deals in the last quarter of 2020.

Explained | What is revenue-based financing and why it is becoming popular,07 May,"Many early-stage ventures and even small and medium enterprises (SMEs) are now opting for revenue-based financing (RBF) instead of approaching venture funds or angel investors. If you are wondering what is the fuss about, here is a primer.What is revenue-based financing?Revenue-based financing is a model for raising funds based on the ongoing revenues of the company. Simply put, a company can pledge a part of its annual revenues in return for growth capital. Typically, early-stage ventures and even SMEs nowadays prefer revenue-based finance as they can get access to funds without any form of collateral or equity dilution. It is considered to be a good source of capital raising for the smaller businesses as it is likely that the quantum of funds they might be looking at would not be significant and the VCs would not entertain pitches or proposals for such fund requirements.How does revenue-based financing work?There are firms that specialise in revenue-based financing. To start with, these companies look at parameters like revenues, cash flows, operating margins, scalability and growth potential among other things as part of their due diligence. Once convinced with the potential borrower’s prospects, they lend the required capital at a mutually decided rate of interest or fee. Interestingly, this is quite similar to how an angel investor or even a VC would function, but what makes revenue-based financing different is the manner in which the funds are repaid by the borrower. The borrower commits to sharing a part of the business revenue with the lender. In other words, both the principal and the fee or interest that the lender charges, is returned from the revenues that the company earns during the normal course of the business.What are the advantages of revenue-based financing?The advantages are manifold. The biggest advantage is that promoters of the borrowing entity do not need to dilute any stake or bring any collateral even while getting access to the much-required funds. This is just not possible when raising funds from angel investors or venture capital firms. Incidentally, this also ensures that promoters continue to enjoy complete freedom in managing the affairs of the company. Typically, entities like private equity or VCs insist on a board seat and are known to interfere in the way businesses are managed in their investee companies. Secondly, revenue-based financing can be helpful to ventures that cannot get bank funding due to lack of collateral or profitability or any other reason that could act as a hindrance.How is revenue-based financing picking up in India?There are firms that specialise in revenue-based financing. Some of the prominent names in India include GetVantage, Klub, Velocity Finance and N+1 Capital among others. The growing popularity can be gauged from the fact that the last 5-6 months have seen nearly 100 revenue-based financing deals in the country. The ticket size could be as low as Rs 5 lakh while going up to a few crores depending on the specifics of the deal.“Revenue-based financing is essentially simplified venture financing without the hassles of collateral or stake sale. It is like founders helping other founders,” said Bhavik Vasa, Founder & CEO, GetVantage.“We charge a flat fee for the financing and the borrower returns the principal and the fee in the form of sharing a percentage of the future cash flows. It is an excellent avenue for emerging businesses especially SMEs that are in abundance in India. Revenue-based financing may be looked upon as an alternate source of funding today but it is only a matter of time it would be mainstream,” said Vasa.While revenue-based financing is a relatively new segment in India, it is a huge market in the US and European region with players like Bigfoot Capital, Uncapped, Lighter Capital, Fleximize and Decathlon Capital Partners among others.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/startup/explained-what-is-revenue-based-financing-and-why-it-is-becoming-popular-6867341.html,Funding,"It is considered to be a good source of capital raising for the smaller businesses as it is likely that the quantum of funds they might be looking at would not be significant and the VCs would not entertain pitches or proposals for such fund requirements.How does revenue-based financing work?There are firms that specialise in revenue-based financing.In other words, both the principal and the fee or interest that the lender charges, is returned from the revenues that the company earns during the normal course of the business.What are the advantages of revenue-based financing?The advantages are manifold.",[],[]
"Exclusive: Ola investor Matrix eyes $75m cash gain in secondary sale, $400m new fund",10 May,"Matrix Partners India, an early investor in ride hailing unicorn Ola, is planning to sell a portion of its stake in the company to existing investors for about $75 million, a key move to return cash to its own investors before raising a new fund later in the year, sources said.Matrix, one of the India’s largest venture capital firms with over a billion dollars deployed in the country, is selling 2-3% of its stake at a company valuation of $3.5 billion. After the stake sale, it will still own about 6% of Ola (ANI Technologies Pvt Ltd), said the people, who requested anonymity.Ola’s founder Bhavish Aggarwal has been more controlling than most founders, curtailing his investors’ rights and boosting his own, and has blocked secondary share sales - like the one Matrix is currently executing - in the past. Matrix getting $75 million cash from its Ola shares would be a massive shot in the arm for the VC firm, which has otherwise had a relatively poor track record of exits from its investments. However, Ola’s valuation currently is subdued due to the Covid-19 pandemic, down from its peak of about $6 billion in 2019.Moneycontrol couldn't ascertain the buyer's name in the secondary share sale immediately.Matrix has had exits of about $100 million so far across its three funds and 15 years of existence, said a person aware of the matter, requesting anonymity. This pales in comparison to peers such as Nexus Venture Partners, Lightspeed India, Sequoia India and Accel, whose funds have returned far more so far, and whose current bets look lucrative as well, although lack of large cash exits has plagued VC firms in India for years now.Matrix has had a number of small exits, but its largest exit is $60 million from classifieds platform Quikr and womenswear maker W, as per data from Venture Intelligence. In comparison, other VC firms have got hundreds of millions, if not more from the likes of Flipkart, Paytm, Oyo, FirstCry and Policybazaar, among others.Over the last few months however, Matrix’s bets look lucrative too, and its stakes in payments firm Razorpay, lenders Five Star Business Finance and OfBusiness and content firm Dailyhunt represent significant wealth. Razorpay was recently valued at $3 billion, Five Star Finance  and Dailyhunt were valued at over a billion dollars, and OfBusiness was valued at $800 million. Matrix’s shares in these four companies alone is worth over a billion dollars. These gains are on paper, and haven’t materialised to actual cash, but the VC firm is holding on to them expecting the shares to be even more valuable in the next few years.Led by these successes, Matrix is preparing to raise a $400 million fourth fund later this year- its largest so far, and for which the Ola share sale serves as a precursor. An Ola spokesperson declined to comment, while Matrix did not respond to detailed emails seeking comment.“Ola was Matrix’s claim to fame for the longest time. But now they are showing 4-5 other companies of real scale. They’re getting cash from Ola so that when they go to the raise, they can tell LPs they have exits. Exits are always the biggest question from LPs” said a partner at another VC firm, requesting anonymity.Limited Partners, or LPs are the people who invest in venture funds- billionaire family offices, pension funds, university endowments, etc.“The current bull market has been good to all VCs, marking up their investments, but if paper valuations are any metric, Matrix looks well-perched. You could not have said that six to eight months back,” the VC added.Matrix’s plans to raise its largest fund yet also signals the startup and funding boom enveloping India, with record valuations, new unicorns and more money than ever before.Matrix was founded by Avnish Bajaj and Rishi Navani in 2006. Bajaj was the co-founder and CEO of Baazee, which was later acquired and became Ebay India, while Navani was a former McKinsey executive and an investor with Westbridge Capital. Matrix raised a $300 million first fund in 2006, and another $300 million in 2011. In 2016 it raised $110 million to top up its second fund, and raised a full third fund of $300 million in 2019. However in 2015, co-founder Navani left to start his own firm, Epiq Capital.Besides Bajaj, Matrix India’s current leadership has three managing directors- Vikram Vaidyanathan, Tarun Davda and Rajat Agarwal.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/startup/ola-investor-matrix-eyes-75m-cash-gain-in-secondary-sale-400m-new-fund-6863361.html,Funding,"Matrix Partners India, an early investor in ride hailing unicorn Ola, is planning to sell a portion of its stake in the company to existing investors for about $75 million, a key move to return cash to its own investors before raising a new fund later in the year, sources said.Matrix, one of the India’s largest venture capital firms with over a billion dollars deployed in the country, is selling 2-3% of its stake at a company valuation of $3.5 billion.These gains are on paper, and haven’t materialised to actual cash, but the VC firm is holding on to them expecting the shares to be even more valuable in the next few years.Led by these successes, Matrix is preparing to raise a $400 million fourth fund later this year- its largest so far, and for which the Ola share sale serves as a precursor.",[],"['about $75 million', 'over a billion dollars', '$3.5 billion', '$75 million', 'about $6 billion', 'about $100 million', '$60 million', 'hundreds of millions', '$3 billion', 'over a billion dollars', '$800 million', 'over a billion dollars', '$400 million', '$300 million', 'another $300 million', '$110 million', '$300 million']"
piVentures looks to raise second fund of up to Rs 750 crore,27 April,"piVentures, which invests in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and deep tech startups, is looking to raise a second venture capital fund three times the size of its first- signalling high interest in technology startups and their investors.The firm on April 26 said that it plans to raise Rs 565 crore with an option to raise Rs 185 crore more (known as greenshoe), compared to its first fund of Rs 225 crore which it raised in 2018.piVentures has invested in healthcare firm SigTuple, logistics firm Locus and space technology firm Agnikul Cosmos among others.“We are clear that we want to invest in AI and technology that really moves the needle, and is really transformational. We don't want to invest in incremental technology or whatever the market finds hot at that point,” Manish Singhal, co-founder and managing partner at piVentures told Moneycontrol.Singhal aims to raise the entire fund in the next one year, and for a first close of about Rs 200-250 crore in the next quarter or so. A first close marks a significant portion of the fund being raised and allows the firm to continue raising while investing in companies as well.While it invested in 15 startups from its debut fund, it will invest in 25 companies from this fund, with the first cheque of $0.5 million to $1.5 million (Rs 3.5 to Rs 10 crore) in seed and pre Series A rounds of startups.“In the next decade or two, India will be the deep tech nation of the world. All our companies are solving inherently global issues. And that is part of the reason why this second fund is larger. We want to enable that opportunity,” Singhal said.piVentures’ second fund also comes at a time when internet startups have been raising money faster than ever at high valuations, and 2021 so far has seen 11 unicorns- startups valued at over a billion dollars- the same as all of 2020. “There is a lot more domestic liquidity and keenness to invest in funds like ours. It is a good environment for investors as well as startups,” Singhal said.Investors from its first fund include UK’s development finance arm CDC, IFC, Accel and Hero Enterprise’s Sunil Kant Munjal, among others. While it has fast-growing companies in its portfolio, piVentures doesn’t have a unicorn yet- generally a marker of success for early-stage VC firms, although by no means the only one.“Unicorns are bells and whistles from a business-to-business (B2B) startup point of view. It doesn't mean much. Unicorns are often a function of how much money you raise, and B2B firms simply don't need to raise that much. For B2B firms, the metrics have to be looked at differently. And I think we can do very well as a fund without unicorns being the key metric,” Singhal said. ",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/startup/piventures-looks-to-raise-second-fund-of-up-to-rs-750-crore-6819581.html,Funding,"piVentures, which invests in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and deep tech startups, is looking to raise a second venture capital fund three times the size of its first- signalling high interest in technology startups and their investors.The firm on April 26 said that it plans to raise Rs 565 crore with an option to raise Rs 185 crore more (known as greenshoe), compared to its first fund of Rs 225 crore which it raised in 2018.piVentures has invested in healthcare firm SigTuple, logistics firm Locus and space technology firm Agnikul Cosmos among others.“We are clear that we want to invest in AI and technology that really moves the needle, and is really transformational.A first close marks a significant portion of the fund being raised and allows the firm to continue raising while investing in companies as well.While it invested in 15 startups from its debut fund, it will invest in 25 companies from this fund, with the first cheque of $0.5 million to $1.5 million (Rs 3.5 to Rs 10 crore) in seed and pre Series A rounds of startups.“In the next decade or two, India will be the deep tech nation of the world.","['Artificial Intelligence', 'SigTuple', 'Locus', 'AI']",['$0.5 million to $1.5 million']
"LEAD School raises $30 million from GSV Ventures, Westbridge",26 April,"LEAD School, an education technology startup that works with private schools, has raised $30 million from US-based venture firm GSV Ventures and existing backer Westbridge Capital, the company said on April 26. The Mumbai-based firm did not disclose its valuation.

Alteria Capital invests Rs 70 crore debt in Dealshare,22 April,"Venture debt firm Alteria Capital has invested Rs 70 crore in Dealshare, which enables group buying of groceries and other items, it said on April 22.Founded in September 2018 by Vineet Rao, Sourjyendu Medda, Rishav Dev and Rajat Shekhar the social commerce startup focuses on middle and lower-income population segments belonging to non-metro, Tier-2 and Tier-3 cities.“We believe Dealshare is poised well to play a pivotal role in bringing e-commerce to the masses in India to serve their recurring shopping needs. The company also empowers regional brands to participate in the e-commerce revolution and connect directly to the end consumer,” said Ankit Agarwal, Partner, Alteria Capital.Venture debt firms also take a small equity kicker in the startups they lend to, and rely on equity fundraising from the startup and some cashflow for their debt to be paid back. Dealshare is also in talks to raise $70-100 million led by Tiger Global, valuing it at $400 million, Entrakcr reported on April 13.  Its other investors include Westbridge Capital, Alpha Wave Incubation, Matrix Partners and Omidyar Network. “We have seen tremendous growth in the last few years as we marched forward in our mission to cater to 500 million new-to-internet users.

Exclusive | Tiger Global in talks to back less than a year-old Dukaan at $300 million valuation,20 April,"Dukaan, an app which helps small offline merchants set up online stores is in talks to raise $35-40 million led by Tiger Global Management- the US-based fund whose dealmaking frenzy has taken the Indian internet ecosystem by storm- sources said.Dukaan will be valued at about $300 million, a nearly fifteen times jump in its valuation from less than six months ago, these people said, requesting anonymity. It raised $6 million led by  Lightspeed India and Matrix Partners India and was valued at about $22 million.Founded by Suumit Shah, Subhash Choudhary, Kaustub Pandey and Anurag Meena last year, Dukaan is among a slew of startups looking to digitise small businesses and take retail (kirana) stores online. The first wave of these apps, including Khatabook and OkCredit looked to digitise accounting for these merchants, helping them keep track of expenses and send payment reminders.Tiger declined to comment while Shah did not respond to queries seeking comment.Dukaan originally started as a backend technology provider for these merchants, but has recently forayed into its own app becoming a digital storefront for these kirana stores, similar to delivery firms Swiggy and Dunzo, which connect customers to retail outlets. The store has to figure out its own logistics- using say Shadowfax or Shiprocket- with Dukaan providing discovery and ordering ability, Moneycontrol reported on March 23.""There is always a trust between you and your existing merchant. So we are focusing on bridging the gap of technology by offering the tools to your local vendors so that he can start generating orders from you online. We just want to arm the small merchants so that they can go and fight with Amazon and Flipkart,"" co-founder Suumit Shah said.Dukaan has started monetising its core business of backend technology, said one person aware of the matter, although Moneycontrol couldn’t ascertain exact figures. For the digital storefront on its app, Dukaan plans to make money either by charging a subscription fee to the store, or by charging for ancillary services such as generating tax invoices.Dukaan has about 4.4 million downloads and is used in over 1800 cities, as per its websiteDukaan and Sequoia Capital-backed Khatabook were also embroiled in controversy late last year, where Dukaan accused Khatabook of stealing and copying its platform and sent a legal notice citing trademark violation. Khatabook had a near identical offering called Dukaan by Khatabook.It became an ugly fight where Khatabook responded citing intellectual property theft and Dukaan claiming Khatabook took down Dukaan related videos from YouTube. The two companies settled the matter with Khatabook taking a small equity stake Internet fims digitising small businesses is seen as a huge opportunity by investors, although most of these firms are yet to make any money. Some of them plan to lend to these SMEs in the future, with financial services being their main income source, although this model has not been proven yet. “The theory is that you solve for distribution and become huge, even if you’re giving it out for free. Once you are big enough, you can make money by lending or subscriptions. But whether small merchants are willing to shell out money for this is a big question,” said an investor in the space, requesting anonymity.BharatPe, which began as an aggregator of QR codes for digital payments has been the only one among a litany of players who has actually gone from free distribution of its app, to actually lending and making money off it.

"PE inflows in India real estate up 19% in FY21, investors eye portfolio deals across cities",15 April,"Despite the COVID-19 pandemic, Indian real estate witnessed over $6.27 billion being pumped into the sector in FY21, as against $5.8 bn in FY20 - an increase of 19 percent in one year, a report by Anarock titled Flux – FY20-21 Market Monitor for Capital Flows has said.Though FY21 was an unprecedented year due to the pandemic, foreign PE funds showed much optimism for India. As much as 93 percent of the total PE investments pumped into Indian real estate was by foreign investors. In actual terms, investments by foreign PE funds almost doubled from $3 billion to $5.8 billion in FY21. In contrast, domestic PE funds invested merely $300 million compared to $420 million in FY20, it said.FY21 saw private equity investors focus majorly on portfolio deals across multiple cities and assets, rather on specific projects or cities. Such portfolio deals constituted 73 percent of the overall share, with approximately $4,583 million invested via portfolio deals in multiple cities, the report said.The average ticket size of PE deals rose by 62 percent in the fiscal year – from $110 million in FY20 to $178 million in FY21. Both structured debt and equity witnessed strong growth during the year at 84 percent and 15 percent respectively. Structured debt was largely towards portfolio deals instead of project-level assets.""Foreign funds are evidently very upbeat about India. High-grade rental-generating assets have attracted foreign investors in a big way during the year. Moreover, India has a strong underlying demand for office space with quality workforce and average rentals available at less than a dollar per sq. ft. per month,” said Shobhit Agarwal, MD & CEO - ANAROCK Capital.COVID-19 VaccineFrequently Asked QuestionsA vaccine works by mimicking a natural infection. A vaccine not only induces immune response to protect people from any future COVID-19 infection, but also helps quickly build herd immunity to put an end to the pandemic. Herd immunity occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population becomes immune to a disease, making the spread of disease from person to person unlikely. The good news is that SARS-CoV-2 virus has been fairly stable, which increases the viability of a vaccine.There are broadly four types of vaccine — one, a vaccine based on the whole virus (this could be either inactivated, or an attenuated [weakened] virus vaccine); two, a non-replicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of SARS-CoV; three, nucleic-acid vaccines that have genetic material like DNA and RNA of antigens like spike protein given to a person, helping  human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine; and four, protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombinant proteins of SARS-COV-2 along with an adjuvant (booster) is given as a vaccine.Vaccine development is a long, complex process. Unlike drugs that are given to people with a diseased, vaccines are given to healthy people and also vulnerable sections such as children, pregnant women and the elderly. So rigorous tests are compulsory. History says that the fastest time it took to develop a vaccine is five years, but it usually takes double or sometimes triple that time.""Alongside, the successful REIT listings have provided a good monetising option for PE investors, leading to a stronger demand for good quality rental earning office and retail assets,"" he said.""Good entry valuation coupled with the option to accumulate a healthy mix of portfolio assets have also driven this surge in foreign PE investments. During the year, PE funds like Blackstone and Brookfield have added a lot of assets to their existing portfolios, while others have takeover loan portfolios of NBFCs.”Among other significant trends, the share of asset classes like commercial, retail and hotel has been very good. While the asset class-wise bifurcation shows lower percentage, when considered along with portfolio deals (where bifurcation is not available), the share of these asset classes is strong.The top 10 deals alone contributed nearly 78 percent of the total PE inflows in FY21 as against 67 percent in FY20. Also, among the foreign PE investors that remained major contributors for overall PE inflows in India, Canada and US-based investors pumped in more than 50 percent of the total foreign PE investments in FY21.The industrial and logistics sector had strong investor support. Key emerging trends in this sector - rise of automation, urban multi-level warehousing, de-centralization, increasing business consolidation, and high demand for Grade A assets.

Opinion | Startup billions—valuation is in the eye of the beholder,02 March,"Billion seems to be the new $100 million at least as far as startups go. While the world is reeling under the deleterious effects of the coronavirus outbreak and India has been hit hard by another wave, startups are raising hundreds of millions of dollars at billions of dollars of valuation. A new unicorn— businesses valued at a billion dollars and more—seems to be born every day.  So is the question: are we in a bubble?  The answer is that no one knows until the bubble bursts. As Warren Buffet so colourfully puts it, “It’s only when the tide goes out that you learn who has been swimming naked.”   The valuation of a startup is nothing but what someone is willing to pay for it, the price at which new investors are willing to invest into the startup. You and I don’t need to agree with the valuation. Some of the smartest investors in the world are doing the investing and setting valuations. That doesn’t stop them from being wrong as evinced by the dotcom and other busts. But if they are consistently wrong, they will soon be out of business.   Timing is everything. Venture capitalists and private equity firms are investing their LPs ’ money. Large pension funds and other institutional investors are traditionally conservative investors but with bond yields at negative levels in Europe and very low levels in the rest of the world, they have been forced to take on more risk to fund their liabilities. If the US one-year treasury rate was yielding above 14 percent in 1981, why bother with investing in anything else? The ultra-low interest rates coupled with the unprecedented trillions of dollars of stimulus due to COVID-19 has caused valuations to increase across the board—startups, stock markets or cryptocurrencies. Also read: Gupshup becomes 10th unicorn of 2021, Tiger Global leads $100 million roundMarket dynamicsIndian startups are lucky to play in a large market, one of the largest in the world. Whether it is in B2C or B2B, the sheer size of our domestic market gives every startup a very high TAM to start with. Large unicorns and decacorns can be built in such a huge market. India is one of the largest smartphone markets, has digital payments and has a very poor physical retail presence. Using websites and apps, startups can reach hundreds of millions of customers easily across the country. Ecommerce companies can ship across India to the remotest pin code. Hyperlocal companies like Ola, Swiggy and Zomato can quickly operate in 500 cities or more given enough capital. Payment companies like Paytm and PhonePe can get millions of customers as digital payments have taken off, especially after the viral outbreak. Given the size of the market, the only thing stopping these companies, and other startups, is capital. Global capital is flooding to India because the US and China consumer markets have become highly mature and are now dominated by large players. India is the largest consumer market still open in most sectors.  Global investors can deploy large amounts of capital in India, help entrepreneurs build huge businesses across the country and see good returns in a short time.  Startup founders have to show hypergrowth to attract these funds and show that large rounds of funding will lead to sustainable mega-enterprises. It is normal to run huge losses in the initial years as they spend on discounts, marketing, technology and teams to scale rapidly once they have product-market fit.  Also read: Listen all ye startups—ignore USOs, keep calm and carry on buildingIt’s the (different) economics, sillyPeople who don’t understand startup economics keep wondering why loss-making companies are getting so much funding, while profitable real-world businesses are not. The answer is scale, scale and scale. Real-world businesses can only scale linearly, while tech startups can scale exponentially. Investors want exponential growth and large outcomes in a short time and only tech startups can do this. Net net, it is a good thing for India to attract such a huge amount of funding. Consumers benefit from lower prices, more convenience and more choice. Tens of thousands of jobs get created by each unicorn as it scales. More success stories lead to even more investment coming into India. The ingenuity and hard work of founders should be celebrated, not questioned. At the same time, founders should not fritter away the funding they raise. It is easy to chase the wrong metrics. Growth at any cost can lead to no growth or collapse when the funding runs out. It takes a rare founder, level heads to use the money raised to build a genuine, sustainable and long-lasting company. We are seeing the Indian startup ecosystem mature and great young founders are doing wonderful work. Ultimately, it's a win-win for everyone. Founders have to ignore the armchair critics who rub their hands in glee when a down round happens and share on Twitter and elsewhere old financial data on how this startup or the other has negligible revenue but huge losses. Why startups need fundingYes, that is why startups need funding. To get to product-market fit, to build their tech platforms, to hire world-class teams and to scale step by step by acquiring millions of customers. Every great company that we use today—Apple, Google, Amazon, Flipkart, Paytm, Swiggy, Zomato, CRED, BigBasket and others—were tiny startups once with zero or minuscule revenue and huge expenses. Not expenses but an investment for the future!We should all cheer the intrepid founder who instead of being an MNC employee took huge personal risks, lived through periods of deep depression and euphoria, sometimes both on the same day and took a shot at entrepreneurship. Thanks to them we have almost everything at the click of a button—fresh food, medicines, healthcare, payments and unlimited entertainment. They deserve our support and accolades, not second-guessing or criticism.For the 99.99 percent of the founders toiling hard, remember that unicorn valuations are extremely rare. Valuations are a matter of timing and luck, of being in the right sector and finding the right investors. As founders, all we can do is focus on building a lasting company by meeting the deep need of our customers. Use the power of compounding to your advantage—keep plugging away one customer at a time and slowly but surely will build a large, lasting business. Chasing vanity metrics, trying to find shortcuts, looking for the latest growth hacks, trying to grow at any cost by incurring huge burn is not the way to go. Value is different from valuation. Founders should focus on creating a lot of value for all stakeholders. Success will surely follow.Here is wishing more such stories among the gloom and doom of the pandemic.(K Ganesh and Srini Rai are serial Entrepreneurs, partners at GrowthStory.in and promoters of startups such as BigBasket, Portea Medical and Bluestone, among other businesses. )",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/startup/opinion-startup-billions-valuation-is-in-the-eye-of-the-beholder-6748091.html,Funding,"While the world is reeling under the deleterious effects of the coronavirus outbreak and India has been hit hard by another wave, startups are raising hundreds of millions of dollars at billions of dollars of valuation.As Warren Buffet so colourfully puts it, “It’s only when the tide goes out that you learn who has been swimming naked.”   The valuation of a startup is nothing but what someone is willing to pay for it, the price at which new investors are willing to invest into the startup.",[],"['$100 million', 'hundreds of millions of dollars', 'billions of dollars', 'a billion dollars', '$100 million', 'hundreds of millions']"
"Alteria Capital hits Rs 1,325 crore first close for second debt fund",09 April,"Alteria Capital said on April 9 that it has raised Rs 1,325 crore for its second fund to provide loans to startups, the latest sign of the startup funding frenzy underway in India and indicating huge demand for experienced fund managers.Alteria has marked a so-called ‘first close’, which allows it to start investing from the fund, even as it continues raising more money in parallel for the fund. It is aiming for a final close of about Rs 1,700 crore in the next 3-4 months.“100 days of Zoom calls with over 200 investors,” is how Vinod Murali, co-founder and managing partner sums up the experience. “I was definitely surprised by the sheer speed of the fundraise. This is significantly higher than we had expected to raise by now,” he said.Investors or limited partners of the fund include high net worth individuals, family offices and some institutions, all from India. Raising over a Rs 1,000 crore locally this fast also indicates that domestic capital is beginning to look at the startup scene in India more seriously.For the longest time venture capitalists in India have been concerned that the domestic pool of capital is too shallow relative to the potential of startups and the quantum of money they raise from overseas.Alteria’s previous LPs include IndusInd Bank, Small Industries Development Bank of India (Sidbi), Azim Premji Foundation and Flipkart co-founder Binny Bansal.“Lots of people have moved from curiosity to action. They want to play in this space and this looks like an inflection point for domestic capital in India,” Murali says.Venture debt firms generally lend to startups with a payback period of two to four years and an interest rate of 12-14 percent (although these terms vary case to case) in exchange for a minute equity stake or warrants in fast-growing startups, as opposed to traditional lenders who look for asset-backed guarantees.Alteria’s 30-odd portfolio companies include milk brand Country Delight, on-demand delivery firm Dunzo, small-business lender Lendingkart, cloud-kitchen firm Rebel Foods and fintech firm BharatPe.Founded by Murali and Ajay Hattangdi in 2018, Alteria raised a debut Rs 960 crore fund in 2019. From the larger second fund, it is also diversifying beyond venture to more structured deals- similar to a bank or NBFC. It is closing a $20 million deal of this kind currently.Late last year, Alteria also poached two executives from venture debt firm InnoVen Capital- Punit Shah and Ankit Agarwal, and made them partners.Moneycontrol reported on March 22 that startups are raising unprecedented amounts of money in increasingly quick periods of time- some are calling it a party, and Alteria’s fundraise is an indicator of sentiment in the ecosystem.“There is definitely a bit of  bubble and a bit of a party going on. And I think there will be a pullback, in anywhere between 6-18 months. So we will look harder for companies that are fundamentally different and founders and demonstrate leadership ability,” Murali said.Venture debt firms effectively rely on the future venture capital that companies will raise to get back their principle and interest- something that looks easy in the current era of abundant capital.But he said LPs were also bullish on Alteria for this fund because even at the height of the pandemic last year, the firm saw zero losses from its first fund. Every company paid back its dues.Unlike their equity counterparts, venture debt firms can recycle capital, since their debt is paid back by companies in a couple of years. Due to this, Alteria will have about Rs 4000 crore available across the two funds to provide venture debt and structured solutions for startups.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/startup/alteria-capital-hits-rs-1325-crore-first-close-for-second-debt-fund-6746521.html,Funding,"Raising over a Rs 1,000 crore locally this fast also indicates that domestic capital is beginning to look at the startup scene in India more seriously.For the longest time venture capitalists in India have been concerned that the domestic pool of capital is too shallow relative to the potential of startups and the quantum of money they raise from overseas.Alteria’s previous LPs include IndusInd Bank, Small Industries Development Bank of India (Sidbi), Azim Premji Foundation and Flipkart co-founder Binny Bansal.“Lots of people have moved from curiosity to action.They want to play in this space and this looks like an inflection point for domestic capital in India,” Murali says.Venture debt firms generally lend to startups with a payback period of two to four years and an interest rate of 12-14 percent (although these terms vary case to case) in exchange for a minute equity stake or warrants in fast-growing startups, as opposed to traditional lenders who look for asset-backed guarantees.Alteria’s 30-odd portfolio companies include milk brand Country Delight, on-demand delivery firm Dunzo, small-business lender Lendingkart, cloud-kitchen firm Rebel Foods and fintech firm BharatPe.Founded by Murali and Ajay Hattangdi in 2018, Alteria raised a debut Rs 960 crore fund in 2019.","['Alteria', 'IndusInd Bank', 'Small Industries Development Bank of India', 'Azim Premji Foundation', 'Flipkart', 'Venture', 'Alteria', 'Dunzo', 'Rebel Foods', 'BharatPe.', 'Murali']",['$20 million']

Edited excerpts. It is an interesting time to do this. You were well capitalised, profitable and well perched. Why get acquired now?It's a good question. The world was moving to digital and fairly fast. We had our own Aakash Digital, which closed the year at close to Rs 150 crore (revenue), but we did feel that the gap between us and the next 2-3 players is pretty large. With money in the bank from Blackstone, we had a choice -- should we throw all our effort from offline to digital, or should we look out for a partnership which is complementary in nature. So we spare them the hard work of building offline, and spare us the hard work of burning cash to build out online.In Byju’s we saw a great opportunity and fitment. On paper and when we met him, the values were very similar. JC Chaudhary, himself being a teacher, has built very strong principles in the company, and when we both met Byju we were both very pleasantly surprised - he has very strong student commitment and passion for education. I think Byju’s as an ecosystem will be a good home for a brand like Aakash. Aakash will continue to remain an independent brand?Yes, it will. The test prep initiative within Byju’s will now come within the Aakash brand. What if you had built it out further and sold it a few years later?It's a bit of a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush. Why should we test the uncertainty when we can choose certainty? As an entrepreneur, you are a risktaker by nature, but here the intention is first to take the risk out of it. Can we build a platform that stretches enough and is aggressive enough, but takes the risk out of it? That is the attempt behind this.Edtech companies are improving access, but many say the quality of education is still an issue. Would you agree?People say that putting a high-end teacher solves the problem, but it doesn’t. It is like, if you have a great surgeon operating on you, but you don't have the right nurses and don’t have the right post-op care, the surgery will go wrong. The same goes for education. A master educator or trainer can be an attraction for students to come, but to make them deliver, consistently over 2-3 years- that is where the systems, processes, commitment, passion and undying spirit come into play. If you pick four teachers from here, five from there and say the product is ready, that will rarely work. A bit like you can’t expect a multi-starrer film to be a hit if you don’t have a story.What do you think the future of education is? Especially given a growing focus on skills rather than degrees?The people who are offering degrees as a piece of paper and not quality of education, will suffer significantly. A lot of the Tier B-C colleges will go through a very tumultuous time. When students can sit at home and get the IIT-IIM tags at a low cost with online certification programmes, that is what students will go after.Google has announced that with their certification programme you don’t even need a degree. You can straightaway join a job. That is significantly changing education. Would Aakash be interested in some of these newer trends and spaces?Under the Aakash brand, probably not because the brand is strongly associated with test prep. We don't want to confuse the audience and we don't want to dent the trust they have in us.  We want to continue to do better, because despite doing this for 30-40 years and being the leader, we are serving 2 lakh out of 30-40 lakh students. We have hardly cracked the market in terms of opportunity. There is a lot more to capture.Will you take a step back from the business? Or continue in a leading capacity?This is one of the initial conversations we had with Byju. Their whole ecosystem has been built with a founder mentality. That’s his core team, be it the founder of Osmo, or WhiteHat Jr. For me the role will continue to be steering the test prep business. I want to be actively involved and use my 15 years of experience in the business. We do have a new CEO (Abhishek Maheshwari, who joined from Byju's a few months ago) but we want to handhold the team through the different cycles of business, sometimes you spot an opportunity from experience.What have your learnings from the last one year been?It is interesting, because we did multiple surveys and got a lot of insights during the year, and every time, students came back saying that this is a high-stakes exam, they needed to meet their teacher, they wanted to come to the centre and solve doubts. There is a very strong pull for offline education. So although now it's a little uncertain with cases going up, in a few months centres will all be opening and students coming in. So you will still reopen each and every centre that you used to have pre-pandemic as well?Yes, absolutely. Parents keep asking us when we will reopen physical branches. Offline as a model will flourish because there is a very strong demand and inherent value they can derive. Had the kids been a little older, you could have said they are self sufficient. But kids from ages 12-17 need that rigout, discipline and continuous monitoring to deliver.What will Aakash’s expansion strategy be? Where will the next level of growth come from?It will come from adding more centres in Tier 3-4 towns, doing deeper penetration in metros and state capitals, so the access to student neighbourhoods will be great.  In 33 years we have reached 2 lakh kids. The objective in the next 4-5 years is to reach 5 lakh kids, by adding more centres to increase penetration.Will you go more digital? Given that you are owned by an internet company now?Digital will become an important part of our offering, in terms of systems, delivery and content. Even before the acquisition our classrooms were more digitally enabled. But with the Byju’s muscle behind us now, we can definitely increase that.What is your biggest challenge today?To keep the student excited and motivated, innovating the offline practice and offering technology and better services for our students. Apart from that it is a great brand, very trusted and with medicine and engineering being mainstream careers, there is an inherent demand from all sections of society. ",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/startup/our-and-byjus-values-were-very-similar-says-aakash-chaudhry-on-billion-dollar-acquisition-6733001.html,Funding,"Aakash’s promoters, led by Aakash Chaudhry, and its investor, private equity giant Blackstone, got 60 percent cash and 40 percent shares in Byju’s in the deal, sources say.In an interview with Moneycontrol, Aakash Chaudhry, managing director of AESL, spoke about why he sold the company now, the future of education, and why despite the edtech wave, offline education and classes are irreplaceable.We do have a new CEO (Abhishek Maheshwari, who joined from Byju's a few months ago) but we want to handhold the team through the different cycles of business, sometimes you spot an opportunity from experience.What have your learnings from the last one year been?It is interesting, because we did multiple surveys and got a lot of insights during the year, and every time, students came back saying that this is a high-stakes exam, they needed to meet their teacher, they wanted to come to the centre and solve doubts.","['Aakash', 'Blackstone', 'Byju’s', 'Moneycontrol', 'AESL', 'Byju']","['$14 billion', 'nearly a billion dollars', 'a billion dollars']"

"Exclusive: Moglix valuation to triple to $1 billion, Falcon Edge to invest",23 March,"Industrial goods marketplace Moglix is in talks to raise $70-100 million in a round of funding which will triple its valuation to a billion dollars- making it India’s latest unicorn, sources told Moneycontrol.London-based hedge fund Falcon Edge Capital, an investor in multiple Indian unicorns such as Dailyhunt, Dream11 and Ola is in talks to lead the round, by investing about $40-50 million, while existing backers including Accel, Sequoia Capital, Tiger Global Management will contribute the rest, said the people who requested anonymity.Moglix was valued at about $250-300 million in its last round in July 2019, when it raised $60 million led by Tiger- at a time when Tiger had gone on a B2B and software dealmaking spree.Founded by former Google executive Rahul Garg in 2015, Moglix sells a wide range of industrial tools on its platform including hammers, drills, wrenches, office stationery and supplies, hospital supplies and automotive supplies. Moglix has been among the many startups tackling the business-to-business e commerce space in India, seen as a huge market ripe for disruption after the likes of Flipkart grew in the consumer facing ecommerce domain.Some of the B2B ecommerce firms in India include Udaan, Infra.market. Jumbotail, Ninjacart and ShopX.For FY19, the latest period for which its financials are publicly available, Moglix’s revenue more than tripled to Rs 217 crore from 62.4 crore, while its losses grew marginally from Rs 28.06 crore to 48.08 crore.Currently it has an annual revenue run rate of $120 million, or about $10 million in monthly revenue, said another person close to the company, requesting anonymity.“The valuation is a little crazy, but it is a result of market momentum. Anyone who is showing ability to execute without burning cash massively is able to raise money at a premium,” the above person added.The COVID-19 pandemic also helped accelate demand for Moglix. In addition to companies buying online more frequently, Moglix also started selling pandemic-related safety items including gloves, masks and Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) kits.In April 2020, it also launched services in the UK and other parts of Europe, but it is unclear how deeply Moglix has penetrated into the market or which products it is selling there.The deal is expected to close in the next few months and will make Moglix India’s fifth unicorn of 2021 after insurance firm Digit, software-as-a-service firm Innovaccer, fellow B2B retailer Infra.market and lender Five Star Business Finance.2020 produced a record 12 unicorns, and if the current rate is anything to go by, 2021 could be another record year for unicorn creation.

"India has 100 unicorns, a Credit Suisse report with unique methodology claims",15 March,"India has a 100 unicorns- private firms valued over a billion dollars- a new report with unique methodology claims, more than double the 35-40 that most other reports and venture capitalists claim.The report from Credit Suisse includes companies which are close to the unicorn mark but are not quite there yet, as well as sectors far away from technology including pharmaceuticals, gems and jewellery and manufacturing.Unicorns are generally defined as technology startups which have attained the billion dollar valuation while still being privately held- generally within 10-12 years. In India, these typically include companies in sectors such as e-commerce, payments, ride-hailing, tech-enabled logistics, education and software-as-a-service (SaaS).The Credit Suisse report includes all these, and broadens its scope to companies including but not restricted to Parle Products, Vishal Mega Mart, Wonder Cement, ReNew Power Ventures, Serum Institute of India and National Stock Exchange.The report says that it includes not only companies valued at over a billion dollar, but also companies whose FY20 earnings, at the average valuation of listed peers, would give them a valuation of over a billion dollar, and where its last funding round was at less than unicorn valuation, but business momentum has been strong since, implying higher valuations.Companies in this category include investment app Groww, education firm Eruditus, social commerce firm Meesho, content firm MX Player, and QR code aggregator BharatPe.“We have spread our net wider, looking beyond the normal technology or ‘technology enabled’ sectors, which are expected to have unicorns but also in conventional sectors like non-banking finance, bio-tech and pharmaceuticals, modern trade, consumer goods as well as infrastructure,” the report said.“We screened for unlisted firms for large profit pools and strong growth, tabulating the list of investments by major private equity (PE) firms, digging into deals news flow, and then meeting several PE firms to make sure the list was comprehensive,” it added.Two investors Moneycontrol spoke to disagreed with the methodology, but acknowledged that India having 100 private companies valued at over a billion dollars is still a very positive sign. They requested not to be named.The growing number of unicorns, and the increasing pace of reaching that valuation can be attributed to a buoyant funding environment over the years.

"SWAMIH Fund to deliver over 6,000 housing units by end of FY22; 1,310 to be completed by April 2021",22 February,"Those waiting for new homes in the beleaguered real estate sector can look forward to some good tidings, thanks to government intervention.Within about a year and a few months since it was tasked with funding stuck projects across the country, SBICAP Ventures, the manager for the government's Rs 25,000-crore stressed-asset fund, will be delivering about 17 housing projects consisting of more than 6,000 homes by the end of the financial year 2022, Irfan A. Kazi, Chief Investment Officer at SBICAP Ventures Ltd, told Moneycontrol.Two projects, 710 units in Mumbai and 600 units in Rewadi, will be delivered by April 2021 itself, he said.The fund, set up under the Special Window for Affordable and Mid Income Housing (SWAMIH) by the government, is looking to complete 17 projects by March 2022.“We are looking at getting 17 projects completed in the next one year. Projects are completed in phases and in this case, we are talking about only the first phase of any project getting delivered. About 6,000 plus homes will be handed over by the end of March 2022,” Kazi said.He did not share details of how much funding has gone into the completion of the projects. “We provide enough funding for completions,” he merely added.The fund has so far given approvals to around 164 projects involving an investment of more than Rs 15,000 crore, which will help complete around 1,00,000 homes. Of this, 55 housing projects have received final approvals and about 109 have got preliminary sanctions.“A total of 164 projects have received some approvals,” he said.As for the challenges, Kazi said that the first charge issue remains a roadblock. Lenders are not willing to give up the first charge.“We are fine with taking charge, subject to a sovereign authority imposition, but the first charge issue still remains a challenge and yet we have achieved significant progress on that front. But we are also doing many deals where some lenders have agreed to cease charge or where there are no lenders. In a few deals, the lender is an Alternative Investment Fund, where there is no issue of a first and second charge,” he said.The Fund sees the COVID-19 pandemic as another reason why developers will approach them. “Once the moratorium ends there will be more housing projects getting classified, according to their health status. More lenders and developers are likely to come forward to seek last-mile funding. We are a distress fund and if there is distress in the environment, there will be a greater number of deals,” the Fund’s Chief Investment Officer reasoned.SWAMIH has received many applications from real estate developers during the COVID-19 crisis after it decided to cut the internal rate of return (IRR) to 12 percent from 15 percent last year.In November 2019, the central government announced a Rs 25,000-crore SWAMIH Investment Fund to help complete over 1,500 stalled housing projects, including those that have been declared non-performing assets (NPAs) or had been admitted for insolvency proceedings. The move is likely to help 4.58 lakh housing units across the country. Only RERA-registered projects with a positive net worth will be provided funds.There are a total of 5.02 lakh units that are presently stuck or delayed, as of the end of 2020, across the top seven cities. Their total value is estimated at over Rs 4.07 lakh crore, an analysis by Anarock has said, adding that National Capital Region (NCR) and the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) together account for a 74 percent 'majority share' of currently stuck/delayed units, while the southern metros of Bengaluru, Chennai and Hyderabad add up to a small 8 percent.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/swamih-fund-to-deliver-more-than-6000-housing-units-by-end-of-fy-2022-1310-to-be-completed-by-april-2021-6553711.html,Funding,"Those waiting for new homes in the beleaguered real estate sector can look forward to some good tidings, thanks to government intervention.Within about a year and a few months since it was tasked with funding stuck projects across the country, SBICAP Ventures, the manager for the government's Rs 25,000-crore stressed-asset fund, will be delivering about 17 housing projects consisting of more than 6,000 homes by the end of the financial year 2022, Irfan A.

"Despite pandemic, startups choose growth over profit",19 February,"Hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic, startups scrambled to cut costs, laid off employees and even shut down some verticals, but a year on, most companies say growing fast is more important than being profitable, a survey has found.About 77 percent of startups consider growth a focus area over profitability, according to a report from InnoVen Capital, a venture debt firm that surveyed 100 startups.“On the face of it, it definitely surprised me, given that for a few months in 2020, survival and a shift to profits was the focus,” said Ashish Sharma, CEO of InnoVen Capital India, told Moneycontrol.But it made sense, said Sharma. “Many startups were able to shed some fat because of the pandemic and become more cost-efficient. Once you do that, with capital still available, making growth your focus again, makes sense,” he added.The survey also shines the light on an eternal debate in the startup ecosystem—growth versus profits. Consumer internet firms sometimes raise billions in capital to gain market leadership and scale, with profits often as a distant goal, even a mirage in some cases. Priorities keep shifting, depending on market sentiment, availability of capital and macro indicators.To be sure, startups are more focused on being profitable than before. In 2019, only 15 percent of the startups said profits were a priority compared to 21 percent this year, the report says. But the focus on growth indicates aggression, a positive fundraising environment and a V-shaped economic recovery.Sector-wise, about 90 percent of founders in enterprise software, digital media and social startups prioritised growth—the highest figure—while direct-to-consumer brands and ecommerce firms were more measured, with 60 percent focusing on growth, and 40 percent on profits.In an encouraging sign, 42 percent of founders also said they expect to turn profitable within the next two years, while 23 percent said they were already profitable. As many as 29 percent said they would take two-four years, while six percent said they would take more than four years.With more startups saying they are or will be profitable, this also gives them a better chance of securing an exit via an initial public offering (IPO) rather than mergers and acquisitions, the main source of exits so far.More founders are beginning to consider an IPO as a likely mode of it—47 percent this year, up from 43 and 39 percent in the preceding two years. Of this, 30 percent are considering an Indian IPO, while 17 percent are considering listing overseas.“Looking at going public is a good sign for the ecosystem, and is a result of the post-pandemic tailwinds. Despite the initial gloom and doom, we have been busier than ever with deals, and companies are showing both growth as well as scale that we have rarely seen this quickly in a market,” Sharma said.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/startup/despite-pandemic-startups-choose-growth-over-profit-6544471.html,Funding,"Hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic, startups scrambled to cut costs, laid off employees and even shut down some verticals, but a year on, most companies say growing fast is more important than being profitable, a survey has found.About 77 percent of startups consider growth a focus area over profitability, according to a report from InnoVen Capital, a venture debt firm that surveyed 100 startups.“On the face of it, it definitely surprised me, given that for a few months in 2020, survival and a shift to profits was the focus,” said Ashish Sharma, CEO of InnoVen Capital India, told Moneycontrol.But it made sense, said Sharma.As many as 29 percent said they would take two-four years, while six percent said they would take more than four years.With more startups saying they are or will be profitable, this also gives them a better chance of securing an exit via an initial public offering (IPO) rather than mergers and acquisitions, the main source of exits so far.More founders are beginning to consider an IPO as a likely mode of it—47 percent this year, up from 43 and 39 percent in the preceding two years.","['InnoVen Capital', 'InnoVen Capital India', 'Moneycontrol', 'IPO', 'IPO']",[]

"Fear, panic and bounce-back: Inside a transport startup's pandemic rollercoaster",10 February,"In March 2020, Cityflo was gearing up for its best-ever phase. The Mumbai-based bus commute startup had finally, after months of investor rejection, closed an $8 million funding round — far more than it had planned to raise. Summers are the best period for the company, as corporate employees flock to its air-conditioned services, abandoning local trains or their own cars.But the best laid plans go awry, and how. This is the story of a transportation startup during the pandemic — the title of a horror movie, some would say — how it battled, survived, learnt lessons along the way, and is now looking to thrive. It is also the story of building a startup away from the limelight, building against many established principles of startups and venture capital, and how despite not being an outright success, it has made a noticeable dent in its space.Cityflo originsFounded in 2015 by IIT-Bombay graduates Jerin Venad, Sankalp Kelshikar, Rushabh Shah and Ankit Agrawal, Cityflo aggregates buses that ply between Mumbai’s suburbs and business hubs in the mornings and evenings. It works with bus owners on 4-5 year contracts and pays them monthly. Cityflo is trying to solve one of Mumbai’s (and arguably the world’s) biggest problems — traffic and the nightmarish experience of getting to office and back from the suburbs. Long, unmoving traffic jams and overflowing local trains are almost an ironic part of Mumbai’s cultureIn an offline-heavy and disorganised industry, it is a hard problem. Cityflo (and others, such as Shuttl, in other cities) had to bring in quality, transparency, be affordable and on time — a notoriously hard problem in India — and do all this without a pile of venture capital to drive the effort. From 2015 to 2020, Cityflo raised Rs 5 crore from VC firm India Quotient, which was a paltry sum in the transportation industry and for internet startups in general. Its focus is corporate officegoers, who are ready to pay the Rs 160-200 that Cityflo charges per trip.But even in a single city with a single focus — commuting — Cityflo has loyal customers and observers are bewitched by its efficiency. In Hiranandani Estate, a gated community in the suburb of Thane, also Cityflo’s headquarters, people go for morning walks. Many of them say that when they see a Cityflo bus take a turn near the clubhouse, they know it must be 7:30 or 8 am — that’s when the bulk of its morning buses leave. And they are right. “It's insane. I don’t look at my watch. When I’m walking back home, and I see their bus take that turn, I know it’s 7:30. I don’t need to check my watch,” said one resident of the area.A year on, as workplaces reopen, Cityflo and its 29-year-old CEO Jerin Venad are daring to dream again. For outsiders, this may look like just another company that struggled during the pandemic and is now talking about growth again. But there’s more to it — Cityflo has always been an unusual startup. It hasn’t raised billions of dollars like some transport startups have. And it operates in only one city, something unheard of for a venture capital-backed firm, whose model prioritises growth over all else. But that unusual nature may well have saved Cityflo.Multiple levels of panicWhen the government announced the first 21-day lockdown on March 24, 2020, followed by more lockdowns, Venad panicked. “There are multiple levels of panic. When your short term revenue disappears, there is nothing more jarring than that,” he says. “As an early-stage company, we don't build revenue every day. We build on the revenue from yesterday. So, losing that momentum hurts.”Initially Venad and his team braced for one or two months of zero revenue. Bad, but not terrible. In fact from March to May, morale inside the company was high. They were lucky to close an $8 million round of funding from Lightbox Ventures just as the pandemic rolled into India, so there wasn’t a cash crunch. In those months, Cityflo fixed a lot of pending issues that founders sometimes miss out on when business is booming. They improved the app, added more features, updated accounting practices and set employee goals with the HR team. There was enough to keep the company busy.Cityflo also had to make sure its drivers were taken care of. Despite being a consumer-facing business, drivers arguably determine the company’s fate more than customers do. The founders created WhatsApp groups to stay in touch with the drivers and reassured them they would have a job if they chose to come back. They encouraged customers, along with the company itself, to pool in money to support the drivers. In 14 hours, had Cityflo drummed up Rs 5 lakh.It also helped that most of Cityflo’s 50-55 employees, including senior management, have been around for 3-4 years of the company’s five years of existence. Knowing the company for that long meant hardly anyone quit, and even in the hardest times, the vibe in the organisation was not toxic. “Once you’ve worked for that long, the relationship goes to a different level. I always say that even outside of this (business), we (the founders) are nice people to hang out with. That comes to the fore during a crisis,” Venad says.This was also the period where many startups, despite having just raised hundreds of millions of dollars, were laying off employees en masse, cutting salaries to the bone, and reconsidering business in general.Cityflo encouraged voluntary pay cuts for people earning over Rs 5 lakh per annum, which was about 60 percent of its total workforce. Almost all the eligible employees took a paycut of about 20-25 percent, says Venad.But the problem started as April ended. While the initial concerns were very short term, the founders started wondering what the pandemic meant for them in the long term. During the first lockdown, the company was still busy fixing various things. Only in May did the real impact start seeping into the organisation and the psyche of its people. No one knew how long this would last. How long would Cityflo have zero revenue and when would the momentum pick up and help it reach the earlier pace?“There were some bad moments for sure, but we have a very simple view of the world. Remote working is a big part of the world, but if something works for a few months, that does not mean it is a sustainable solution,” Venad says.ReopeningSo, Cityflo reopened cautiously from June 15, catering only to workers in essential sectors such as healthcare. Buses were sanitised after every trip, drivers checked customers’ temperature before they stepped in, masks were mandatory, and the company even went for a third-party safety audit. Equinox Labs, which generally works with restaurants to certify the quality of the air, water, food and environment, among other things — certified Cityflo’s practices to be safety-first.Through the months of the lockdown, the startup sent regular app notifications to its users not only to keep the connection going but also to survey how many would resume going to office, and if they would use Cityflo when they did.“A lot of customers said that on the first day they were nervous, but they saw the measures we were taking, and that put them at ease. That was a big sign of validation for us. And of our former users who were now at home, 95 percent said that when they start going to the office, they would use Cityflo. So, we just had to be patient,” Venad says.Patience is not a word often associated with internet startups, which are a lot about mentality. The mentality is to grow, to expand, do things faster, better (than yourself and anyone else) and repeat. That mentality during a pandemic almost seems laughable. And this is where Cityflo’s investors come in.Cityflo is a curious bet for new investor Lightbox Ventures, which focuses exclusively on the consumer segment and makes few but high-conviction bets with significant ownership — a somewhat rare strategy in early-stage venture capital. Cityflo’s investors urged the company to pursue growth aggressively once again.Lightbox Ventures’ thinking on Cityflo is interesting as well. Like many investors, to see your portfolio company, that too a newly funded one, shut down temporarily and be at reduced scale for a year isn’t easy. But Sandeep Murthy, partner at Lightbox, says: “Our decisions are ten-year decisions (from investment to exit). You invest with a fundamental thesis. Transportation, more than any other industry, will take time to recover. But that thesis doesn't get thrown out of the window overnight, even by these large external factors.”“After we invest, for the first year, I don't care about growth or revenue numbers. I want you to build the best product you possibly can,” Murthy adds. That’s exactly what Cityflo did from March to June.And nowAs of February 2021, Cityflo is back to 65-70 percent of its pre-pandemic revenue. A year ago, it was doing about 8,000 rides a day with a fleet of 150 buses, and about Rs 2 crore of revenue a month. Today, it is doing 5,000 rides a day with a fleet of 100 buses, and once again eyeing what all startups crave: growth.“In the last three months, we have grown 40-50 percent a month. And of this, 60 percent of the revenue is from new customers, people who have never used Cityflo before;15-20 percent of the offices Cityflo served pre-pandemic have reopened, but 60-70 percent of our revenue has returned. So, the fact that new customers are using us is really encouraging,” Venad says.Venad believes he can build Cityflo into a Rs 100-200 crore revenue business in Mumbai alone. To justify his thinking, he doesn’t compare Cityflo to other mobility startups or unicorns. He compares it to D-Mart (Avenue Supermarts Ltd), one of India’s most successful retail chains.""They had no hurry to go pan-India. Even today more than a third of their stores are in Maharashtra. So, as long as the economics make sense here, I don’t want to expand to other cities. Maybe at some point, but certainly not anytime soon,” he says.The economics of Cityflo also separate it from the hoi-polloi of mobility startups that have raised a lot of money in a few years but have not registered profits or even gross margins in some cases. Cityflo is gross-margin positive, which means its revenue is more than its basic costs and covers some of its overhead expenses as well. But it still has not recorded a net profit, which is not uncommon but also highlights the challenge of a niche and operations-heavy business.Cityflo’s older routes, such as from Thane to Lower Parel or Nariman Point are profitable. But the newer routes it launches, say, from the western suburbs to South Mumbai, will take a few months to be profitable, assuming the kind of growth and adoption Venad is expecting.The bustle is backYou can hear the relief in Venad’s voice when he is talking about how things are different today. “The bustle is back. It’s good to see growth again, and I’m very optimistic  but I have to put extra effort and remind myself to be objective,” he says.Which is an odd thing to say. How can you be objective about your own company? When you are finally seeing business and revenues again, what does objectivity even mean?“See, my optimism is around our ability to execute. When we are executing, we don’t take no for an answer. But you have to be aware of the reality of the world. External factors are a big part of this business, and that’s where I have to be objective. If I lose hold of reality just because of optimism, it is dangerous,” he says.Cityflo’s buses are visible in various parts of the city, with the yellow-and-white logo standing out. You can see customers jostling to get into the bus going from Thane to Lower Parel. It is a sign that the company — and the country — are on the mend.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/trends/features/fear-panic-and-bounce-back-inside-a-transport-startups-pandemic-rollercoaster-6480921.html,Funding,"It is also the story of building a startup away from the limelight, building against many established principles of startups and venture capital, and how despite not being an outright success, it has made a noticeable dent in its space.Cityflo originsFounded in 2015 by IIT-Bombay graduates Jerin Venad, Sankalp Kelshikar, Rushabh Shah and Ankit Agrawal, Cityflo aggregates buses that ply between Mumbai’s suburbs and business hubs in the mornings and evenings.Equinox Labs, which generally works with restaurants to certify the quality of the air, water, food and environment, among other things — certified Cityflo’s practices to be safety-first.Through the months of the lockdown, the startup sent regular app notifications to its users not only to keep the connection going but also to survey how many would resume going to office, and if they would use Cityflo when they did.“A lot of customers said that on the first day they were nervous, but they saw the measures we were taking, and that put them at ease.","['IIT', 'Cityflo']","['$8 million', 'billions of dollars', '$8 million', 'hundreds of millions of dollars']"

Blume Ventures to raise new fund to offer exits to existing investors in rare startup move,05 February,"Indian starup investor Blume Ventures is in talks to raise a Rs 400-crore fund to buy out its own holdings in older portfolio companies and double down on a few of its existing investments, said people familiar with the matter.The so-called secondary fund will give an exit option to early investors from whom Blume raised funds to invest in businesses. This kind of fund-raising—unprecedented in the Indian venture capital space—allows Blume to retain its stake in startups with a new set of investors.""No VC in India has done this before—to replace old LPs with new LPs and still manage the fund yourself. It's a unique structure that could become common in the future,"" said a senior investor on condition of anonymity.LPs, or limited partners, are high net worth individuals, family offices, university endowments, or pension funds that invest in venture funds.Blume plans to use the proceeds of the fund—named Fund 1x and launched in December 2020—to reshuffle the investment structure in eight to 12 companies, according to these persons who didn’t want to be named. Moneycontrol has also reviewed documents that reveal Blume’s secondaries fund plan.The move underscores the paradox of increasing investor interest in Indian startups despite the difficulty in securing timely exits.It is also a validation of Blume's track record—in recent years, the Mumbai-based firm has picked out several winners such as online learning firm Unacademy, delivery startup Dunzo and robotics firm GreyOrange. Even if a startup is doing well, early-stage investors often look for an exit depending on how long businesses stay private.The new fund, which has a different set of LPs, will function as a lower-risk, lower-return investment vehicle compared with the early-stage funds Blume typically runs.Blume declined to comment on a query from Moneycontrol.Blume’s new fund would centre on two type of transactions. One, the so-called secondary sale under which shareholders—typically early investors—of a private company sell their shares to another buyer. This is different from a ‘primary’ sale, in which company issues new shares to investors, and the proceeds of that sale go directly into the company.Using proceeds of the new fund, Blume will buy out its own holdings in GreyOrange, makeup brand Purplle, insurance firm Turtlemint and software-as-a-service firms WebEngage, Exotel and IDfy.As a sweetener, this fund will increase its stakes in Dunzo, milk and groceries delivery platform Milkbasket and Slice, a credit and payment platform in their future funding rounds, according to the persons cited above, ""So along with older companies, the LP is also getting stakes in newer fast-growing startups,"" said a person involved in negotiations, requesting anonymity.The new fund essentially means a unique structure for the Indian startup ecosystem. Raising this fund solves many key issues for Blume and its investors.Many of Blume’s proposed secondary investments— GreyOrange, Exote, Webengage and IDfy­— are from its first fund in 2010. This poses an issue.The Lifecycle of Such Funds Venture funds generally have a lifecycle of seven-10 years during which they are supposed to invest and return profits to their LPs. The LP structure is key to this transaction working out.“They are effectively replacing old LPs with new LPs. They are selling a whole block of six companies to new LPs and Blume will still earn carry whenever these companies have an eventual exit—a merger or an IPO,” one of the persons cited above said.Carried interest, or carry, is the money venture capitalists earn on profits made on investment—often in many millions— and is the cornerstone of the VC business model.A combination of primary and secondary investments is vital to Blume’s investment recast. With the new fund and new LPs investing in Blume’s 10-year-old investments today, they are betting these companies can still grow significantly.“The secondary investments have to grow from here. Only then does the structure really make sense and the new LPs stand to make money,” said another person aware of discussions, requesting anonymity.Adding some primary deals was like a sweetener from an LP perspective. So, in addition to some of the older companies, they would also get stakes in some of the newer companies and be part of their long-term growth, the person said.Fund 1x will have an investment period of two years and a five-year life cycle that can be extended to seven with the approval of LPs.The Returns Blume Is TargettingIt expects to generate an Internal Rate of Return (IRR) of 25 percent—the average rate of return adjusted for the time value of money—generally the yardstick for measuring VC returns. Because this fund will invest in established firms but at higher valuations, its risk is lower but so are the returns.Most LPs in early-stage venture funds expect a gross IRR of 30-40 percent over an 8-10 year fund lifecycle.For instance in 2019, Norwest Venture Partners India sold stakes in half a dozen of its business-to-business and software bets, including now unicorn Zenoti, Capillary Technologies and logistics firm Elastic Run. These stakes were acquired by Avatar Venture Partners, a fund set up by Mohan Kumar, a former partner at Norwest.What Blume is doing is similar except it is managing the selling and the buying and only the LPs are changing.Started in 2010 by former angel investors Karthik Reddy and Sanjay Nath, Blume raised a debut Rs 100 crore fund entirely locally to make angel investments in an institutional manner. It followed this up with a $60-million second fund in 2015 and a $102 million third fund in 2019.As it grew, it became much more like a traditional venture fund— looking for sizable stakes early on with a focused approach and raising money from foreign institutions and family offices.Its second fund had 67 percent of the capital from abroad and the third fund had 80 percent. Foreign LPs have a different approach than Indian LPs—they invest in large funds globally, cut larger cheques and have a longer horizon.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/startup/blume-ventures-to-raise-new-fund-to-offer-exits-to-existing-investors-in-rare-startup-move-6457041.html,Funding,"This is different from a ‘primary’ sale, in which company issues new shares to investors, and the proceeds of that sale go directly into the company.Using proceeds of the new fund, Blume will buy out its own holdings in GreyOrange, makeup brand Purplle, insurance firm Turtlemint and software-as-a-service firms WebEngage, Exotel and IDfy.As a sweetener, this fund will increase its stakes in Dunzo, milk and groceries delivery platform Milkbasket and Slice, a credit and payment platform in their future funding rounds, according to the persons cited above, ""So along with older companies, the LP is also getting stakes in newer fast-growing startups,"" said a person involved in negotiations, requesting anonymity.The new fund essentially means a unique structure for the Indian startup ecosystem.So, in addition to some of the older companies, they would also get stakes in some of the newer companies and be part of their long-term growth, the person said.Fund 1x will have an investment period of two years and a five-year life cycle that can be extended to seven with the approval of LPs.The Returns Blume Is TargettingIt expects to generate an Internal Rate of Return (IRR) of 25 percent—the average rate of return adjusted for the time value of money—generally the yardstick for measuring VC returns.","['GreyOrange', 'Turtlemint', 'WebEngage', 'Exotel', 'TargettingIt', 'Internal Rate of Return', 'IRR']","['$60-million', '$102 million']"

MPower Financing gets $25 million in a new funding round,27 January,"Washington DC-headquartered lending platform Mpower Financing has raised $25 million in its equity funding round led by Tilden Park Capital Management, a New York-based investment management firm.Mpower Financing helps students who are looking to study abroad get education loans to attend universities in countries like the United States and Canada.

Indian startups are flush with money but are they staring at a valuation bubble?,20 January,"In October 2020, a set of investors were jostling to invest in a fintech startup, which was already flush with cash. The startup didn't even have any plans to raise more fund for at least a year more, as it did not even start spending the $60 million it raised six months ago.The startup, that does not burn cash, was already valued at a steep $300 million. However, the investors - including the biggest names in technology and first-time investors in India from the US, persisted. The startup’s founder, somewhat reluctantly and almost bemused, agreed to raise money, but at nearly double the valuation in six months. The investors agreed.In three other cases that Moneycontrol learnt of in the last six months, startups set a valuation - aggressive by any measure - and simply waited for investors to take the plunge. In each case they did. In some cases multiple suitors queued up to invest.Certainly, a lot changes in a year. Heading into 2020, most venture capitalists were preaching caution after years of exuberance and driving loss-making companies to sky-high valuations in the US and India. Then Uber’s tepid listing followed by WeWork’s spectacular implosion led most investors to evaluate large cheques much more carefully.However, all this was before the COVID-19 pandemic hit, giving uncertainty and slowdown a whole new meaning.A rise in internet users during the pandemic, unprecedented growth, and a rapid bounce-back from lockdown has taken deal-making back to its heyday. The valuations are rich, the metrics are sometimes shaky, and growth is always the priority. Valuations are determined not necessarily by fundamentals such as forward revenue multiples or share price to earnings, they are determined by demand and supply, urgency to invest, fear of missing out, and excitement driven by growth.Take fintech for instance. Cred, BharatPe and Khatabook and three companies, collectively valued at $1.7 billion, have exactly zero revenue.Online learning firm Unacademy is expected to have a revenue of about Rs 400 crore in FY21, according to a person close to the firm. But, it is valued at $2 billion (Rs 14,000 crore), about 35 times forward revenue.Even Byju’s, India’s most valued edtech startup is valued at $12 billion with about $700 million in expected revenue - an aggressive, but far lower multiple of 16-17 times.The signs are typical. Large markets, pedigreed founders, high growth, top early stage Venture Capitalists (VCs) backing you, and the chances of that next outsized round, even at a unicorn status - the coveted billion dollar valuation - are high. But when the large deals happen for unproven companies, when the valuations double and triple in no time, it leads to one question - are we in a bubble?The question is always a hard one because historically, it is only after economic bubbles have burst that most people realise they were in one.“It is particularly hard to tell this time around, because we are going through a digital revolution. For the longest time, India’s internet market size was a huge question. With Jio, UPI, and now the pandemic, digital adoption has taken off in a way even bullish investors didn’t expect a year back. So, companies will be priced on future value. And if you are a smart entrepreneur, the price will be higher than many expect,” said a partner at a leading venture capital firm, requesting anonymity.Rich valuation multiples have also spilled over from the usual suspects - consumer internet firms, to enterprise software companies. This is new. For instance, SoftBank last year invested in Mindtickle, valuing it at $500 million on about $20-25 million of expected revenue. Even software-as-a-service (SaaS) firms such as Slack, Zoom, Snowflake and Cloudflare in the US have gone public in the last few years with resounding success.""SaaS valuations are very rich following on the lines of the frenzy in the public markets. And a demand supply dynamic where investors want to get into a few late stage quality SaaS deals. Both public and private markets are at a high and further building upon this,” said Karan Sharma, co-head of the digital technology arm at investment banking firm Avendus.Sentiment in India often flows directly from the US - more so in similar spaces and from funds which invest in both countries - to many of India’s top VC firms. US-based startups raised a record $130 billion in 2020, rising 14 percent year-on-year despite the pandemic which shut economic activity for a few months, according to CB Insights, a data tracker.Indian startups raised $10.6 billion, compared to $12.5 billion in 2019, as per Venture Intelligence, a startup data tracker.Indian startups end dependence on Chinese moneyPublic vs privateStartup valuations are also linked to how publicly listed companies are trading - whether retail investors are willing to pay high prices for loss-making companies, whether the banks underwriting a share issue can find enough at a certain price, etc. For example, in 2019 when Uber’s shares did not rise after going public, and WeWork saw its valuation slashed by more than two-thirds privately, it was seen as an indicator that private companies are perhaps overvalued, and that their “real” value will be determined only at listing.Today, the opposite seems to be happening. American food delivery firm Doordash and hospitality firm Airbnb’s IPO opened spectacularly, jumping 92 percent on trading day. Indian equity markets have seen a similar wave albeit at a smaller scale. Recent IPOs of Burger King India, breadmaker Mrs. Bectors, IT firm Happiest Minds and others, have all been oversubscribed hundreds of times.“For the first time in years, you could very seriously argue that private markets are actually more rational than public markets. So the select over-valued companies may not be overvalued if stock markets are the benchmark,” said a partner at a venture fund, requesting anonymity.And a more critical look at what a bubble comprises, and what Indian startups are doing, provides a clearer picture.The alternative investing industry, including private equity, venture capital and hedge funds, is expected to have $17 trillion in assets, as per a report from Preqin, a global alternate asset data tracker. Further, commitments in Asia Pacific are growing the fastest, at 25 percent compounded annually.All things considered, while valuations are exuberant and the best startups have their pick of investors and price more than ever before, there seems to be more rationale behind it than previous years, investors say.""There has been bullishness in growth investing behind sectors that have come out very strongly from this pandemic and high interest is driven towards select market leaders. In the growth stage, the unit economics and profitability profile has significantly improved over the last 18 months,” said Sharma.“One would always assume some rationalisation at such levels, however, given the level of liquidity in the market, it might not be significant. There might be some volatility, but a large correction seems unlikely in the short term,” he added.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/indian-startups-are-flush-with-money-but-are-they-staring-at-a-valuation-bubble-6369691.html,Funding,"US-based startups raised a record $130 billion in 2020, rising 14 percent year-on-year despite the pandemic which shut economic activity for a few months, according to CB Insights, a data tracker.Indian startups raised $10.6 billion, compared to $12.5 billion in 2019, as per Venture Intelligence, a startup data tracker.Indian startups end dependence on Chinese moneyPublic vs privateStartup valuations are also linked to how publicly listed companies are trading - whether retail investors are willing to pay high prices for loss-making companies, whether the banks underwriting a share issue can find enough at a certain price, etc.So the select over-valued companies may not be overvalued if stock markets are the benchmark,” said a partner at a venture fund, requesting anonymity.And a more critical look at what a bubble comprises, and what Indian startups are doing, provides a clearer picture.The alternative investing industry, including private equity, venture capital and hedge funds, is expected to have $17 trillion in assets, as per a report from Preqin, a global alternate asset data tracker.","['CB Insights', 'Venture Intelligence']","['$60 million', '$300 million', '$1.7 billion', '$2 billion', '$12 billion', 'about $700 million', 'billion dollar', '$500 million', 'about $20-25 million', 'a record $130 billion', '$10.6 billion', '$12.5 billion', '$17 trillion']"
Health startup MFine raises $16 million in a bridge round,18 January,"Health tech platform MFine has raised $16 million in a new funding round led by Heritas Capital fund along with the Singapore-based family office of Y’S Investment, the company said on January 18.Existing investors—SBI Investment, SBI Ven Capital, Beenext and Alteria Capital—also participated in the round that comes in the backdrop of massive business growth reported by health tech platforms during the coronavirus pandemic. The platform has reportedly grown ten times in 2020.“Our vision of digital health as a solution to scale quality healthcare delivery has been accelerated by two years. The entire ecosystem is now on an accelerated transformation with the Indian government also introducing the National Health Stack,” said Prasad Kompalli, cofounder, MFine.MFine, which in 2019 raised its series B round of $17.2 million, will use the fresh funds to strengthen its leadership team and its technology platform to create a virtual hospital network for its users.The company will increase its investments in technology by three times and expand its network of doctors and hospitals with these funds, it said in a note.COVID-19 VaccineFrequently Asked QuestionsA vaccine works by mimicking a natural infection. A vaccine not only induces immune response to protect people from any future COVID-19 infection, but also helps quickly build herd immunity to put an end to the pandemic. Herd immunity occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population becomes immune to a disease, making the spread of disease from person to person unlikely. The good news is that SARS-CoV-2 virus has been fairly stable, which increases the viability of a vaccine.There are broadly four types of vaccine — one, a vaccine based on the whole virus (this could be either inactivated, or an attenuated [weakened] virus vaccine); two, a non-replicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of SARS-CoV; three, nucleic-acid vaccines that have genetic material like DNA and RNA of antigens like spike protein given to a person, helping  human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine; and four, protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombinant proteins of SARS-COV-2 along with an adjuvant (booster) is given as a vaccine.Vaccine development is a long, complex process. Unlike drugs that are given to people with a diseased, vaccines are given to healthy people and also vulnerable sections such as children, pregnant women and the elderly. So rigorous tests are compulsory. History says that the fastest time it took to develop a vaccine is five years, but it usually takes double or sometimes triple that time.With more than 4,000 doctors from 600 hospitals covering 35 specialties on the platform, MFine provides users on-demand access to medical care online. More than one million users have used the MFine platform to tele-consult with doctors on a variety of illnesses such as diabetes, arthritis, viral infections and others.In 2020 MFine expanded its coverage beyond physical boundaries of the cities to serve people from more than 1,000 towns and launched several new services such as AI-based self-assessment of various health conditions and long-term care programmes for chronic conditions.“We believe that MFine’s collaborative partnership model with hospitals and doctors powered by the application of AI will enable smart optimisation of limited healthcare resources to address unmet needs throughout India and beyond,” said Chik Wai Chiew, CEO & Executive Director of Singapore-based Heritas Capital.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/health-startup-mfine-raises-16-million-in-a-bridge-round-6359391.html,Funding,"The good news is that SARS-CoV-2 virus has been fairly stable, which increases the viability of a vaccine.There are broadly four types of vaccine — one, a vaccine based on the whole virus (this could be either inactivated, or an attenuated [weakened] virus vaccine); two, a non-replicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of SARS-CoV; three, nucleic-acid vaccines that have genetic material like DNA and RNA of antigens like spike protein given to a person, helping  human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine; and four, protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombinant proteins of SARS-COV-2 along with an adjuvant (booster) is given as a vaccine.Vaccine development is a long, complex process.More than one million users have used the MFine platform to tele-consult with doctors on a variety of illnesses such as diabetes, arthritis, viral infections and others.In 2020 MFine expanded its coverage beyond physical boundaries of the cities to serve people from more than 1,000 towns and launched several new services such as AI-based self-assessment of various health conditions and long-term care programmes for chronic conditions.“We believe that MFine’s collaborative partnership model with hospitals and doctors powered by the application of AI will enable smart optimisation of limited healthcare resources to address unmet needs throughout India and beyond,” said Chik Wai Chiew, CEO & Executive Director of Singapore-based Heritas Capital.","['RNA', 'MFine', 'MFine', 'AI', 'MFine', 'AI', 'Heritas Capital']","['$16 million', '$17.2 million']"
N+1 Capital in talks to raise $100 million for Revenue Based Financing for startups,15 January,"N+1 Capital, which wants to pioneer the Revenue Based Financing model for startups in India, is in talks to raise a $100 million debut debt fund, its executives said. Under this model, N+1 will lend a certain amount to startups, and in return takes a fixed percentage of the startup’s revenue every month.N+1 is working with angel investment platform LetsVenture to raise the fund, and last week received approval from markets regulator SEBI to raise the fund. The fund will be run by Rahul Chowdhury and Ashish Singla. While Chowdhury is an active angel investor with previous entrepreneurial stints, Singla used to head Max Ventures, the investment arm of the insurance group Max.In India, startups so far raise money in two ways- either by selling shares to venture capital investors, or by raising venture debt- where funds provide debt in exchange for warrants in the company- which can be exercised as shares later on.“VCs generally want to back the rocketship companies. And a very small proportion of companies will be a rocketship. But the rest of them are still worth funding, and that is where we come in. You don't need to dilute for us, and we only need stable growth,” Chowdhury, Managing Partner - N+1, told Moneycontrol.N+1 will look for startups which have a revenue of at least Rs 50 lakhs a month, and have positive gross margins.N+1 plans to cut a first cheque of about Rs 15 crore per company, and top it up further if the company manages to grow consistently. It wants to build a portfolio of 150 companies over the next two-three years.It plans to raise the fund in the next three-four months, and is planning a first close of $40 million in the next month or so. A first close allows a fund to start investing, while it parallely continues raising the rest of the fund.While conversations are still ongoing, Limited Partners (LPs) or investors in the fund will be high net worth individuals from India, the US and UK, in addition to a few institutions. About half the fund is expected to be raised from abroad, Chowdhury said.“The traditional world of investing is all about the people one knows, warm introductions and recommendations. While human relationships are great and necessary, they can be vulnerable to bias. While there has been significant innovation on the fundraising side, the investment business model still works like it always did. N+1 is trying to bridge this gap. We have a data driven risk assessment technology model that makes the product accessible for new age entrepreneurs and minimises human bias in decision making,” said Ashish Singla, Managing Partner, N+1 Capital.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/n1-capital-in-talks-to-raise-100-million-for-revenue-based-financing-for-startups-6351001.html,Funding,"While Chowdhury is an active angel investor with previous entrepreneurial stints, Singla used to head Max Ventures, the investment arm of the insurance group Max.In India, startups so far raise money in two ways- either by selling shares to venture capital investors, or by raising venture debt- where funds provide debt in exchange for warrants in the company- which can be exercised as shares later on.“VCs generally want to back the rocketship companies.A first close allows a fund to start investing, while it parallely continues raising the rest of the fund.While conversations are still ongoing, Limited Partners (LPs) or investors in the fund will be high net worth individuals from India, the US and UK, in addition to a few institutions.","['Singla', 'Limited Partners']","['$100 million', '$40 million']"

"From coding to live classes, 5 young Indian ed-tech startups you should know about",30 December,"Education technology has been the dominant theme of 2020 among Indian startups. The coronavirus outbreak put the already growing sector on steroids, making it mainstream overnight. This year alone, Byjus’ valuation has gone from $5 billion to $10 billion, Unacademy from $500 million to $2 billion. And while valuation is only one metric, the change is evident as 2020 has also seen a lot of smaller edtechs gain traction. Moneycontrol looks at some of the early-stage ed-techs companies in India. SwiflearnFounded by Abhinav Agarwal and Anand Bakode, Swiflearn provides live classes for students from Classes 1-10. It claims to be India’s “most sincere learning platform”, with face-to-face classes from the top 1 percent of teachers. It also provides unlimited tests for practice and a calendar for school and exam needs. Swiflearn is seed funded by VC firm Stellaris Venture Partners and Venture Highway.Masai SchoolMasai derives its name from Masai Mara, the world renowned national park in Kenya, where co-founder Prateek Shukla got the idea for the company. Masai runs a coding bootcamp that lasts 30 weeks. The clincher is that Masai works with an income share agreement—students pay Masai’s fees only if they get a job—and most do. With coding becoming an important skill in need of constant upgrade, its courses cater to students who have no coding experience as well. It is funded by India Quotient.Leverage EduFounded by Akshay Chaturvedi, Leverage Edu helps students who want to study abroad—using technology to figure out their preferences, opportunities and connect demand to supply. Students who have used Leverage Edu have had over 1,000 offers from Ivy League universities, with Leverage having over 100 trained counselors and 2,000 mentors. It is funded by Blume Ventures and DSG Consumer Partners.ClassplusOne sign of maturity in a sector is when its starts throwing up enterprise software companies rather than pure consumer-focused firms. Classplus app allows coaching classes and individual teachers to set up an online teaching platform. Its software helps sell courses, conduct live classes, have a dashboard and unlimited students and recorded lectures.

Exclusive| Billionaire Yuri Milner fund in talks to invest in Rupeek,29 December,"Yuri Milner, the billionaire chief of global technology fund DST Global, is in advanced discussions to back gold-loans startup Rupeek, nearly doubling its valuation in less than a year, sources have said.One of the world's most influential investors, Milner's Gemini Investments, along with other partners of DST Global, are expected to lead a round of about $45 million, valuing Rupeek between $550-600 million, sources said.""They (Rupeek) are raising simply because there's enormous interest. They haven't even used the money from their last round. It's a financially sound model but raising money fast helps corner the market,"" said a person close to the deal, requesting anonymity.Two new funds—Vostok Emerging Finance and HighSage Ventures—are also joining the round, with existing investor GGV Capital doubling down on the company, sources said.Vostok is a fintech-focused emerging market investor, while HighSage is a Boston-based public and private market investor.Spokespersons for Milner and Rupeek did not respond to Moneycontrol’s emails seeking comment.Founded by Sumit Maniyar in 2015, Rupeek is the largest player in the digital gold loans space and disburses about Rs 450 crore a month compared to Rs 20 crore a year ago.It was valued at $300 million in February 2020 when Flipkart cofounder Binny Bansal led a $60-million round with GGV Capital and early backers Sequoia Capital, Accel Partners and Bertelsmann India Investments.The round is also likely to include an ESOP (Employee Stock Option Plan) buyback of about $5 million, giving early employees a windfall on their shares.Rupeek is also in talks to partner with State Bank of India, the country’s largest lender, as reported first by Moneycontrol on November 10. At present, it partners primarily with Karur Vysya Bank and Federal Bank.The lending environment has been shaky and startups have borne the brunt of aggressive lending as defaults rise and coronavirus outbreak takes its toll. But gold loans are secure by nature and hence a safer bet, investors say.“We want to invest in technology, and I know I can bring us to profits in a couple of years. Once we achieve a certain scale (lending Rs 1,500-2,000 crore), we can replicate the playbook in each city, we will be unstoppable,” Maniyar had told Moneycontrol in an interview.DST Global and Milner have been active in India over the last few months. Milner generally cuts smaller cheques in early-stage startups from his personal vehicles—Apoletto and Gemini. DST is exclusively a late-stage investor and has backed online learning firm Byju's and car portal Cars24 this year. Milner led an $80- million round in credit-card repayment app Cred.The deal would also cap a healthy year for startup fundraising despite the COVID-19 pandemic.

Year-ender 2020 |Here's why 2020 had the lowest number of deals in the last five years,23 December,"The global pandemic managed to slow down deal-making in the Indian startup ecosystem both in terms of the amount of money being pumped in and the number of deals closed.Data sourced from business intelligence platform Venture Intelligence show only $10.6 billion worth of VC money being pumped in this year, compared to more than $12 billion last year.Even 2018 and 2017 saw $10.9 billion and $10.7 billion getting pumped into the sector. In terms of the number of deals, only 648 VC deals were signed in 2020, making it the slowest in terms of deals signed over the last five years.While edtech grabbed the maximum attention, with Byju’s Classes getting more than a billion dollars of VC money through four deals during the year, food-delivery major Zomato came second with around $660 million raised from large investors.In terms of sectors, ecommerce emerged as the favourite among investors, attracting $2.3 billion across 85 companies followed by edtech with $2 billion across 57 companies.Edtech steals the showByju’s rode the edtech wave and raised two big rounds in the middle of the pandemic from investors such as Tiger Global, Silver Lake and others. The online education platform got another round of $200 million from General Atlantic in February 2020, just before Covid19 struck, and $300 million from Tiger Global in January.Budget hotel chain Oyo got around $500 million from Softbank in March, before the full impact of the virus was felt here. Since then the company has also seen a massive hit on its business as travel came to a standstill through much of 2020.While other companies that raised massive rounds were from sectors that benefited during the pandemic, Zomato was an outlier. At a time when food and beverages as an industry got ravaged by Covid-19, the restaurant discovery and food delivery platform managed to get around $660 million from prominent investors. Among them were Tiger Global, Temasek, Kora Managements and Steadview Capital. It also spoke about hitting the public markets by 2021.Among the other players with big fundraising rounds were fantasy gaming platform Dream11, software as a service startup Zenoti, ecommerce player Ecom Express and used-car selling platform Cars24.Fintech still hotWhile consumer-facing startups managed to get the big cheques, in terms of the number of deals, fintech is still getting a lot of attention from investors, with 92 companies getting funded. Players such as Cred and Razorpay emerged as the leaders, riding the wave of digital payments and fintech lending. Razorpay marched into the unicorn club this year.In terms of the amount of money pumped in, ecommerce continues to be most attractive, with $2.3 billion across 85 companies. Edtech got more than $2 billion being put in across 57 companies, followed by $1.7 billion invested in 31 companies in the logistics space.Among the large VCs active in the country, Softbank pumped in the highest amount with almost $800 million deployed across companies such as Policybazaar, Unacademy and Oyo Rooms. Tiger Global has deployed $529 million across companies such as Razorpay, Chargebee and Dream11, followed by Sequoia Capital, which has put in $342 million in Bounce, Freshworks and Cardekho, among others.A year like no otherVenture capitalists have pointed out that during the first few months of the pandemic deal making was stuck; but as things eased up and restrictions were relaxed, deals started flowing.Reliance Jio raising billions of dollars from Facebook, Google and others made global VCs sit up and take notice of the opportunities in India. Further, with the deterioration in relations between India and China and the US and China, many deals started flowing into India from the West.2020 also was the year when deals started getting finalised over video calls and digital signatures, something unimaginable in the pre-Covid days. So, even when partners of VC firms could not travel to visit companies, they were ready to strike deals remotely.Another important trend spotted by tech investors was the rapid pace of digitisation caused by the pandemic, which opened fresh disruption opportunities for startups. Hence, VCs keen to get a share of the pie were ready to loosen their purse strings.

"Pine Labs gets funding from Lone Pine Capital, attains valuation of $2 billion",21 December,"Merchant payment company Pine Labs has raised an undisclosed sum from Lone Pine Capital, valuing the company at over $2 billion, the company said in a press note on December 21.While the company did not disclose the exact amount raised, industry sources pointed out the range of funds raised to be between $75 million and $100 million, in a mix of primary and secondary shares. Some early investors in the company sold their shares as well in this round, the source added.Pine Labs, a Delhi NCR-headquartered digital payment company deploys PoS terminals at merchant outlets and is one of the largest players in this space in India. It has forayed into South East Asia and other parts of the world too.Founded in 1997, Lone Pine Capital is a Connecticut-based investment firm which picks up strategic stakes in companies across multiple sectors through equity deals.“Small businesses and consumers are fast adopting to digital commerce and contactless checkout. We are also seeing tremendous uptake in Pay Later services and have now enabled nearly 150,000 outlets for this. It’s time to invest heavily in offline and online commerce across India and SEA,” said B. Amrish Rau, Chief Executive officer, Pine Labs.Lone Pine’s investment follows the strategic investment made by Mastercard in January 2020, when Pine Labs attained unicorn status. Earlier in December, Pine Labs and Mastercard jointly announced that they will expand their integrated “pay later” solution to five South East Asian markets early next year.Pine Labs is backed by large investors like Temasek, PayPal, Sequoia Capital. In 2018, it received $125 million from Temasek and PayPal Holdings. It did not disclose the investment amount from Mastercard.While it started with card processing terminals across merchant outlets, currently Pine Labs is investing heavily in smart PoS terminals, buy now pay later options and smart EMI options for consumers.Pine Labs works with more than 1.5 lakh merchants in 3,700 cities across Asia and the Middle East.

"Choose your customers, don’t let them choose you, says Zenoti CEO Sudheer Koneru",21 December,"Subscription-based software may be the norm today but that was not the case in 2011 and certainly not in the niche salon and spa business. Few multibillion-dollar companies were paid for specialised software solutions but that’s what Zenoti CEO Sudheer Koneru wanted to change. In the week gone by, Zenoti was valued at a billion dollars when it raised $160 million led by private equity firm Advent International.The deal that made Zenoti the newest Indian unicorn is also a sign of the frenzy in the software-as-a-service (SaaS) industry, where startups are raising funds at a valuation 20-30 times their revenue. Zenoti, too, has benefitted from this boom. Of the $250 million it raised since 2011, more than $200 million has come since mid-2019 alone.In a video interview with Moneycontrol’s M Sriram, Koneru opens up about contrarian decisions, what makes the salon and spa business unique, IPO plans, and more. Edited excerpts:Why did you start Zenoti? What was the thinking?I finished my previous startup, also in enterprise, after running it for eight years and took a break for a couple of years. I spent a lot of time on yoga, meditation, and general wellness. I wasn't planning to go back to work but I invested in a chain of fitness chains, spas and salon centres called Latitudes. I was just an investor. But after two years of them being operational, I realised that if you want to run a multi-store outlet, it is very challenging. There was no software system for that.And before I knew it, a lot of people wanted to join me in doing this. So that made me take it seriously and actually start this, although I hadn’t planned to do so.Verticalised SaaS businesses weren’t as common in 2011. So what was your thesis to build this?Even in 2011, these spas and salons were using desktop-based specialised software. It wasn’t some generic software solution. Generic point-of-sales software doesn’t meet the needs of the spa industry. Managing appointment books, chairs and spa rooms is a complex problem. Some rooms can be used for facials, some for nail care. So there was a need to transform them into cloud computing and the large businesses were really struggling.Every day a store manager would export data and send it to the head office. An accounting team at the head office would put that data into (Microsoft) Excel and give it some format. All of it is back-office work and nothing is automated.The other reason to build a big enough company is that it is a complex enough problem and we do the entire tech stack—from booking an appointment online to using the software at the front desk, employee payrolls, purchasing products—these companies do retail too. You can buy shampoo from there. So, there is a chance to monetise the entire value stack.In this full stack, how do you prioritise services that are most important to you?Initially, core operations had to be streamlined, that was the priority. We help companies that have more than 20-30 outlets to streamline business—that was our original pitch.After that it was, now let's elevate the guest experience because initially even after we streamlined the business, the guest experience was exactly the same as earlier.We wanted to make it Starbucks or Uber-like, where you book from your phone, when you walk in the salon is notified and when the service is done, the stylist just marks on their phone. The customer’s phone says you have been charged for this amount and you walk out.The third phase is using artificial intelligence and data to automate decisions such as how many people or who should come to the office, what all products to buy, optimising store efficiency. We think machines can do this and do it better than humans.You have raised nearly all your capital only since mid-2019- from Tiger, then Steadview and now Advent, though the company is much older. Has anything fundamentally changed since 2019?That’s a fair observation. We grew at about 75-80 percent in 2019 and slightly slower in 2018.The good part is that there is nobody to compete with us to serve large businesses. I can tell you that if a salon or spa chain has looked at going for a software offering, it has to be Zenoti.So we raised only $21 million in our history until we got there.And COVID-19 was a big reason for this round. It has accelerated change in this industry by three-four years. Earlier, we would pitch to someone and they would say, “Okay, maybe I’ll consider this next year”. Now when businesses were reopening, we said they didn’t just reopen with more sanitation and hygiene but should also fix their IT infrastructure.So now salons are using us for that top-class experience, which wasn’t as important earlier. Enough brands today are offering that Uber-like experience, for everybody to feel like they should have it too.Oh, it was definitely bad. March-April everyone was shut down and laying off employees. Our own customers weren’t talking to us, let alone potential new customers. We were still important because all these companies’ data is on Zenoti, so they can't just pull the plug on the contract or something, but we did give some customers a discount, deferred payments for some, saying you pay half when you reopen. But in the US, it was less of an issue because the fees they are paying is relatively small, given the size of their business. They pay us about $500 a store (a month).We built a lot of features for online retail. So even if your shop is closed, customers can buy products online. For large stores, 20-30 percent of their revenue comes from retail. We also tweaked our gift card system a little, linking it to a specific stylist. They are also suffering, but if you are open to it, why don't you use this gift card and go to this stylist whenever we reopen. We will pay the stylist that money.And mainly, we worked a lot on our messaging. We said that if you’re anyway shut down and free, why don't you look at upgrading your software? It was a good time to catch them because many of them now had time to talk to us. Some of the owner-driven businesses moved very fast, recognising that this is a good time to implement our solution.What percentage of your revenue is from the US?Sixty percent is from the US, 15-20 percent is from the UK followed by Australia and New Zealand with about 10 percent. The rest is India and the Middle East.And how did you deal with the pandemic internally?We laid off 15 people, mostly in our Seattle office. We froze hiring for some time. Travel, marketing, all budgets were frozen and we controlled costs big time but in three months, we started hiring again and had to go back to everything. Since July or so, we must have added at least 70-80 people.How is the India market for you?We serve most of the large stores in India but the revenue per store is lower. Our costs though are the same, since it is hosted via AWS (Amazon Web Services) and our offering is the same. If a store in the US will give us $500, in India it’ll give us $150 (a month).Do you expect the US' share in your revenue to come down?Not for some time at least. The US and the UK are our big growth markets. More broadly, the US represents 50 percent of the market opportunity we are chasing. And I think the US will be 50 percent of our revenue for the foreseeable future.We understand your annual recurring revenue (ARR) is about $45 million. Could you confirm that?We don't disclose ARR, so I won't comment on that. We grew 100 percent this year and will grow at least that much next year.What has been your biggest challenge this year?People. Making sure that people are able to work from home and be productive. We have invested a lot in employee well being but people working virtually can be chaotic. It is a bit easier in the US but in India, people don’t necessarily have the space for a home office. So we have sent them chairs and desks, so they have some equipment at home.It's about people’s capacity and how much people have been stretched. We’re also in this unique situation where customers want our software but we don’t have enough people to deliver that software. So we’ve had to stretch quite a bit to make this year’s results and numbers happen.Have you thought of an IPO? Yes, in two-three years.What do you need to do to get there?If we definitely grow 100 percent each of the next two years, we will be within striking distance of preparing for a listing. We also have to still innovate our products and have more mature technology. It is about maintaining the velocity we are seeing in the market today.How do you view the IPO timing? Now seems like a great time to go public with valuations soaring?Yes, it is, and my thesis is it will stay this way for a few years. There may be some minor correction but that is fine. But, in general, people are realising SaaS business models are very strong.And when will you be profitable?We might have been EBITDA profitable (a metric of operating profits) earlier but then we hired so much and growth is the main priority. Maybe Q1 of 2022 is when we will be profitable.What has surprised you the most in your journey with Zenoti except COVID?I think how well our choice of customers has worked for us has surprised me. The value proposition of really focusing on our market has surprised me. This thesis of serving only large companies and believing that we choose the customer, not the other way around. Because of this, our product became better, our customers are healthier—there is less churn, and our financial metrics are better. Even when COVID happened, the customers we chose were the ones who had no problems reopening, as opposed to saying, we decided to shut down for good. Focusing on who we want to cater to worked really well for us.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/startup/choose-your-customers-dont-let-them-choose-you-says-zenoti-ceo-sudheer-koneru-6250451.html,Funding,"All of it is back-office work and nothing is automated.The other reason to build a big enough company is that it is a complex enough problem and we do the entire tech stack—from booking an appointment online to using the software at the front desk, employee payrolls, purchasing products—these companies do retail too.We help companies that have more than 20-30 outlets to streamline business—that was our original pitch.After that it was, now let's elevate the guest experience because initially even after we streamlined the business, the guest experience was exactly the same as earlier.We wanted to make it Starbucks or Uber-like, where you book from your phone, when you walk in the salon is notified and when the service is done, the stylist just marks on their phone.",['Starbucks'],"['multibillion-dollar', 'a billion dollars', '$160 million', '$250 million', 'more than $200 million', 'only $21 million', 'about $500', '500', '150', 'about $45 million']"

Meet the two 20-year-old Indian-origin AI startup founders who've turned investor darlings,17 December,"Samir Vasavada and Runik Mehrotra are the talk of the street. They are just 20, and Vise, their AI-enabled investment management company, earlier this week received Series B funding of $45 million.Investors might be more than happy to write cheques for them now, but there was a time when they were rejected by about 1,000 investors, including Vinod Khosla, the Delhi-bred billionaire titan of Silicon Valley.Vasavada and Mehrotra were raised in Cleveland and Detroit, respectively, and met at a North Western University’s summer research programme. Though they officially started Vise in 2019, they had been working as consultants since they were 16. We will give you some time to pick up your jaw.An obvious lesson from their success is perseverance. The other is to keep working on the pitch and learn from rejections. The lanky Vasavada, who likes business books and recently lived without his iPhone for three weeks, maintained a detailed record of failed meetings. Lesson number three is that perception and fortunes can change quickly even if one or two big players come on board.After Khosla and several others turned Vasavada and Mehrotra down, and after they polished their pitch, they raised $2 million from Keith Rabois, a co-founder at PayPal and a partner at Founders Fund, and Ben Ling of Bling Capital. Both were earlier at Khosla Ventures. The tide had turned.“This was our first round of fundraising ever,” Mehrotra told TechCrunch. “So in the beginning, a lot of it was just like, figuring out how things worked and learning how to best pitch the company because it is a niche market. I think once we got the momentum, we felt like we were turning away tons of money.”Then there was the matter of convincing people in the trade to take them seriously but there was a positive side to that too, Vasavada said on Nasdaq Trade Talks.“A challenge of being young, which is also a benefit, is that lack of experience can sometimes bring a new perspective. People that said to us, ‘Hey, you haven’t been in the industry for X number of years, you haven’t been alive that many number of years’, we were able to say to them, ‘Hey, that’s why we have this new perspective, this new product’,” Vasavada said.“You can almost think of us as a highly personalised, highly automated approach to wealth management for investment advisers,” Vasavada said, speaking a million words a minute.The deep-voiced slightly chubby Mehrotra, who once posted a picture of Po from Kung Fu Panda as himself, said, “Rather than use AI to replace humans, we use it to empower them. We build tools and technology to help financial advisers be better at their job and provide more customised offerings to their clients.”Speaking about the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on their business, Mehrotra told Nasdaq Trade Talks that it was important for them to show their clients that Vise was in it for the long haul. “With the capital raised (this was after their Series A funding), we have five to seven years of runway even as we scale the business. So it’s kind of partnering with our current advisers and customers that we are going to be here even if there’s significant market turmoil.”Vasavada said, “(Financial) Advisers saw quite a bit of client growth (during the pandemic, as people were concerned about their investments). During that, advisers thought what platform can help me better explain what’s happening (in the markets) to my clients. They saw us as one of the solutions.”",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/startup/meet-the-two-20-year-old-indian-origin-ai-startup-founders-whove-turned-investor-darlings-6239051.html,Funding,"I think once we got the momentum, we felt like we were turning away tons of money.”Then there was the matter of convincing people in the trade to take them seriously but there was a positive side to that too, Vasavada said on Nasdaq Trade Talks.“A challenge of being young, which is also a benefit, is that lack of experience can sometimes bring a new perspective.People that said to us, ‘Hey, you haven’t been in the industry for X number of years, you haven’t been alive that many number of years’, we were able to say to them, ‘Hey, that’s why we have this new perspective, this new product’,” Vasavada said.“You can almost think of us as a highly personalised, highly automated approach to wealth management for investment advisers,” Vasavada said, speaking a million words a minute.The deep-voiced slightly chubby Mehrotra, who once posted a picture of Po from Kung Fu Panda as himself, said, “Rather than use AI to replace humans, we use it to empower them.","['Vasavada', 'Vasavada', 'Vasavada', 'AI']","['$45 million', '$2 million']"
MC ExpertEye | Have startup troubles made investors more vigilant?,11 December,"Note to Readers: MC ExpertEye is a weekly series of articles that will dive deeply into an important topic by seeking answers from experts.   A failed WeWork initial public offering (IPO), falling valuations of most domestic unicorns in the aftermath of the coronavirus outbreak and a raft of corporate governance issues have shaken the confidence of venture capital firms. While most are still bullish on the Indian ecosystem, they are being more careful to ensure they are betting on the best.We spoke to some experts to understand the reasons and what investors were doing to make sure they were backing the right companies. Take a look at what they had to say:Avimukt Dar, founding partner, Indus Law: Venture capital and private equity investors have always regarded the founder and management team’s integrity as non-negotiable. This is because business plans and strategies can change quickly but people don’t. The systemic diligence levels have gone up much more recently because unicorns resemble listed companies in terms of stakes and governance risk.Anand Lunia, managing partner, India Quotient: The startup space is attracting large sums of money that sometimes dwarf even the private equity space. These funds will naturally need large outcomes, which will likely come only when lasting institutions that go public are built. The style of investing in the past may not work.""Culture eats strategy for breakfast"" as Peter Drucker said. A lasting institution needs a great culture, however great a strategy may be. Things like early mover advantage, last-man-standing, winner-takes-all, etc are good terms but usually lead only to mediocre M&A outcomes.Given these imperatives, it's surprising that some late-stage funds (and even some early-stage funds) investing in India have struggled to identify critical cultural and ethical issues inside some startups. While I have no late-stage investing experience, I feel that what we look for as a seed fund in founders, teams and culture might be getting overlooked when the number-games take over. We routinely reject companies on the basis of issues highlighted by customer calls, employee interviews, code reviews, social media comments and reference checks. One would think that such things are even more rigorous in the late-stage investing world. The DNA of the company needs as much analysis as the market opportunity or past performance.Sidharrth Shankar, partner at J Sagar Associates: Venture Capital investing and risk have become synonymous in the corporate world. The need to conduct due diligence into startup companies is the need of the hour, as with the number of startups increasing, the rate of failure has invariably risen. With COVID-19, the startups are strapped for cash while those investors who are flush will use the pandemic-backed opportunity (ie buyer’s market) to negotiate for lower valuations. With the high failure rates, coupled with the unfolding effects of COVID-19, thorough diligence is required in key areas such as:(i) Identifying debt triggers through debt funding arrangements, charges, loans, etc and capacity to pay off those debts without equity dilution(ii) Intellectual property ownership/licence rights(iii) Change of control triggers in third-party contracts/investment contracts(iv) Pre-existing exclusivity arrangements if any(v) Territorial competition restrictions, etc. A thorough due-diligence of the red flags will also be hand in glove with the investor’s intent to secure the right valuations.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/startup/mc-experteye-have-startup-troubles-made-investors-more-vigilant-6217911.html,Funding,"While most are still bullish on the Indian ecosystem, they are being more careful to ensure they are betting on the best.We spoke to some experts to understand the reasons and what investors were doing to make sure they were backing the right companies.The need to conduct due diligence into startup companies is the need of the hour, as with the number of startups increasing, the rate of failure has invariably risen.",[],[]

Exclusive | Warburg Pincus in talks to acquire stake in boAt,08 December,"Private equity giant Warburg Pincus is in talks to invest in earphones and wearables brand boAt Lifestyle, as the Delhi-based company rides a wave of online buying and looks to de-link its operations from China amid border tensions, sources have said.Warburg will likely acquire a 40 percent stake in Imagine Marketing, which runs boAt, valuing it between Rs 1,500 and 1,600 crore, the sources told Moneycontrol.General Atlantic, another global private equity firm, was interested as well but Warburg is likely to seal the deal in the next few months, sources said.Warburg and boAt did not respond to detailed queries from Moneycontrol, while General Atlantic declined to comment.Founded by Sameer Mehta and Aman Gupta in 2016, boAt started by selling earphones primarily on Amazon at rock bottom prices—a strategy that paid off. It then diversified to other audio accessories such as headphones, wireless earphones, speakers and sound bars. Today it also sells power banks and charging cables for smartphones as well as smartwatches.While it started with earphones priced between Rs 300 and 500, the price range of its products today is Rs 300-Rs 13,000, though the price undercuts the competition in every sector.boAt has sourced its components from China, where both quality and scale have been available. Contrary to what people think, for something like earphones, China offered bulk production and good quality of suppliers, said a seller of audio gadgets, requesting anonymity. “It is not that the quality is lower. But the downside is that boAt is then seen as a trading business, not manufacturing or a full-stack model, which is riskier and may be less valuable to investors,” the seller said.The coronavirus pandemic followed by border tensions with China that lead to a deadly clash in June and say a ban on Chinese apps and greater scrutiny of investment from the country have spooked the industry. Players are trying to delink operations from China as much as possible, a hard sell given that 99% of the earphones industry is dependent on China. However, boAt has set up a research and development unit and a supply chain team in June, with Prime Minister Narendra Modi talking about local manufacturing as the China standoff continued.The company has started shifting manufacturing to India and already makes cables but even for those, China provides better quality connectors, the person above added.“In April and May, when most of India was locked down, boAt spent a lot of time figuring out how to localise manufacturing. De-linking from China is a huge priority for them,” said another person close to the firm.Though the country began rolling back restrictions in June, customers still flocked to online retailers. In addition, the new norm of working from home and consuming content online also pushed up demand for audio equipment.“One, a lot of offline demand, which was anyway only 15 percent of their revenue, moved online. Two, the initial sales in June were seen as pent-up demand but that growth has sustained. Three, advertising during the festive season with cricketers such as Hardik Pandya and KL Rahul helped,” the person cited above said.boAt is expected to clock a revenue of Rs 12,00-1,300 crore for FY21 and an EBITDA, or operating profits of Rs 80-90 crore. EBITDA stands for Earnings Before Interest Taxes Depreciation and Amortization.According to a recent International Data Corporation report, boAt is now the fifth-largest player in the global wearables market.For the September quarter, boAt accounted for 2.6 percent of wearable shipments, tying with Google-owned Fitbit. It only trails Xiaomi, Huawei and Samsung.For Warburg Pincus, a 40 percent stake at a valuation barely 1.2 times the revenue gives it enough control and an entry into the burgeoning audio and wearables market.boAt has, so far, raised less than $10 million from venture firm Fireside Ventures. It has raised multiple rounds of debt, however, from RBL Bank and venture debt firm InnoVen Capital.Warburg’s other internet bets in India include auto retailer CarTrade, classifieds firm Quikr, trucking logistics firm Rivigo, ecommerce logistics firm Ecom Express and most recently, Perfios, a fintech startup that collects financial data to help make credit decisions.Globally, the American PE firm manages $62 billion in assets across a dozen countries.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/startup/exclusive-warburg-pincus-in-talks-to-acquire-stake-in-boat-6202261.html,Funding,"Private equity giant Warburg Pincus is in talks to invest in earphones and wearables brand boAt Lifestyle, as the Delhi-based company rides a wave of online buying and looks to de-link its operations from China amid border tensions, sources have said.Warburg will likely acquire a 40 percent stake in Imagine Marketing, which runs boAt, valuing it between Rs 1,500 and 1,600 crore, the sources told Moneycontrol.General Atlantic, another global private equity firm, was interested as well but Warburg is likely to seal the deal in the next few months, sources said.Warburg and boAt did not respond to detailed queries from Moneycontrol, while General Atlantic declined to comment.Founded by Sameer Mehta and Aman Gupta in 2016, boAt started by selling earphones primarily on Amazon at rock bottom prices—a strategy that paid off.But the downside is that boAt is then seen as a trading business, not manufacturing or a full-stack model, which is riskier and may be less valuable to investors,” the seller said.The coronavirus pandemic followed by border tensions with China that lead to a deadly clash in June and say a ban on Chinese apps and greater scrutiny of investment from the country have spooked the industry.","['Warburg Pincus', 'Imagine Marketing', 'Moneycontrol', 'Moneycontrol', 'General Atlantic', 'Amazon']","['less than $10 million', '$62 billion']"
"Last week in startup funding | Cred raises $80 million, valuation gets closer to billion-dollar mark; Corestack, Happydemic, Signzy, edtech startup Kyt and others raise funds too",06 December,"Last week saw the big bang funding round of Bengaluru-based Cred, which raised $80 million from the partners of DST Global and its existing investors, pushing its valuation to $800 million. The market was abuzz with speculation on the way forward for this two year old startup, which saw a meteoric rise since its birth.Moneycontrol had written about its impending funding round here.Further Moneycontrol tried to make sense of the reason behind this value which Cred has received here.Another interesting fund round was announced by edtech startup Kyt. Founded by ex-Uber Eats top executive in India and South Asia Bhavik Rathod along with his wife Tripti Ahuja, Kyt raised $2.5 million. Along with Sequoia Surge others like Titan Capital, Kunal Shah, Amrish Rau, Jitendra Gupta, Allen Penn and Martin Li participated in the round.Along with Kyt another startup Pune-based health insurance broker Loop Health has also raised seed funding of $2.3 million from Sierra Ventures, Soma Ventures, Y Combinator and few other investors.Besides these startups, Corestack, Happydemic and Signzy also raised their series A rounds. While Corestack got $4 million from Iron Pillar, Happydemic got $3.6 million from Adelie and Sia Partners. Then KYC solutions startup Signzy got $3 million from Vertex Ventures.While this was not an external funding round, but it was a big news and needs to be mentioned here. PhonePe, the Bengaluru-based digital payments player raised a massive $700 million at a valuation of $5.5 billion and in the process exited the Flipkart stable.Now the company will be forming its own board and will chart its own future growth path. While Walmart continues to be a major investor on board, Sameer Nigam, chief executive of PhonePe might eventually get big cheques from others investors looking to get a pie of the growing digital payments ecosystem in the country.Overall while this week might not have seen multiple blockbuster funding deals, venture capital firms are losing their purse strings as they actively scout for interesting startups which might emerge winners in a post COVID-19 world.

"Third Derivative invests in 50 startups, including 3 from India, to battle climate change",03 December,"Third Derivative (D3), an initiative of two US-based firms, has invested in 50 startups, including three from India, to combat climate change and create an ecosystem for these firms to grow, develop and find partners.D3 is a joint venture between the Rocky Mountain Institute, a think tank focused on energy efficiency and innovation, and New Energy Nexus, a not-for-profit that backs clean-energy entrepreneurs with accelerators and networks.“No one invests in hard-tech solutions.

Healthcare startup funding could fall globally in Q4: Report,03 December,"Healthcare startups are likely to see a drop in fund-raising in the last quarter of 2020, indicating a slowdown globally after the previous two quarters saw strong funding as the coronavirus pandemic raged a report has said.As of November 17, 2020, healthcare startups across the world had raised $10.2 billion this quarter, market intelligence platform CB Insights says. Though the quarter, is only halfway through, it is unlikely that startups will equal or best the record $22.3 billion they raised in the previous quarter. The report took into account the January-December calendar year.The number of deals, too, could drop below 1,300 for the first time in eight quarters, an indication that funds are being cornered by bigger players and the early-stage activity may be slowing down.The report projected 1,267 deals for this quarter, 20 percent less than the 1,575 deals in the September quarter.The possible funding slowdown could be led by slowing deal-making in all major regions, with no area seeing an uptick quarter-on-quarter, the report says.North American startups are projects to raise $11.8 billion, compared to $13.3 billion in the last quarter. Asian startups are projected to raise $5.5 billion compared to $6.6 billion in the last quarter and European firms may raise $2 billion compared to $2.3 billion.Africa, South America and Australia could be an exception, together seeing $78 million in healthcare funding, up from $45 million in the previous quarter.Digital health funding is also expected to fall by volume and value. The report projects that digital health startups will raise $5.5 billion this quarter across 372 deals, less than the $8.4 billion across 505 deals last quarter. While $5.5 billion will be the lowest digital health funding in six quarters, 372 deals will be the lowest in at least 12 quarters.Last quarter, healthcare startups globally raised a record $21.8 billion in funding led by a spike in digital solutions, which have become more important during the pandemic as people stay at home.Healthcare investments grew 18 percent quarter-on-quarter from $18.4 billion, while the number of deals also rose from 1,299 to 1,539, according to CB Insights report.Digital health startups raised $8.4 billion in the September quarter, 73 percent more than the previous quarter, across 508 deals, only 8 percent more than the previous quarter.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/startup/healthcare-startup-funding-could-fall-globally-in-q4-report-6183961.html,Funding,"The report took into account the January-December calendar year.The number of deals, too, could drop below 1,300 for the first time in eight quarters, an indication that funds are being cornered by bigger players and the early-stage activity may be slowing down.The report projected 1,267 deals for this quarter, 20 percent less than the 1,575 deals in the September quarter.The possible funding slowdown could be led by slowing deal-making in all major regions, with no area seeing an uptick quarter-on-quarter, the report says.North American startups are projects to raise $11.8 billion, compared to $13.3 billion in the last quarter.While $5.5 billion will be the lowest digital health funding in six quarters, 372 deals will be the lowest in at least 12 quarters.Last quarter, healthcare startups globally raised a record $21.8 billion in funding led by a spike in digital solutions, which have become more important during the pandemic as people stay at home.Healthcare investments grew 18 percent quarter-on-quarter from $18.4 billion, while the number of deals also rose from 1,299 to 1,539, according to CB Insights report.Digital health startups raised $8.4 billion in the September quarter, 73 percent more than the previous quarter, across 508 deals, only 8 percent more than the previous quarter.","['healthcare', 'Healthcare', 'CB Insights', 'Digital']","['$10.2 billion', 'the record $22.3 billion', '$11.8 billion', '$13.3 billion', '$5.5 billion', '$6.6 billion', '$2 billion', '$2.3 billion', '$78 million', '$45 million', '$5.5 billion', '$8.4 billion', '$5.5 billion', 'a record $21.8 billion', '$18.4 billion', '$8.4 billion']"

Kunal Shah's Cred valued $800 million with DST partners funding,01 December,"Credit card repayment startup Cred has raised $80 million in funding from partners of DST Global, already an investor in the company, and others, valuing it at $800 million, up from $450 million a year ago, two people aware of the matter confirmed to Moneycontrol.A startup is termed as 'unicorn' when it reaches at least $1 billion valuation. With this funding round, Freecharge co-founder Kunal Shah's second venture is now valued at $800 million.Cred’s existing backers—Sequoia Capital, Tiger Global Management and Hillhouse Capital and others, have also participated in the round.Moneycontrol first reported Cred's funding talks with various investors.“Discussions are still going, and documentation is not yet done,"" said one person aware of negotiations, who did not want to be named.Cred started as an invite-only app. This exclusivity led to its initial success. The app is now open for all those who have credit scores of over 750. In India, a customer's credit score, also known as CIBIL score, is calculated out of 900.What is Cred? Cred is an app beneficial for customers with multiple credit cards. It tracks credit card due dates and alerts customers of their upcoming payments dates. One can clear their credit card dues on Cred using UPI and other payment options. Less than 60 million people in India have credit cards making the category lucrative for advertisers and businesses chasing consumer wallets.Cred, by trying to get these people on its platform, offers a ready market for businesses to target these high-spenders.In lieu, Cred offers customers points that can be redeemed on its platform itself with participating businesses. For example, one can part pay a holiday, electronic items, services, food, beverages and grooming products using Cred points.A Cred spokesperson declined to comment.Cred has been aggressive in its marketing over the past few months. The startup spent and won rights to official sponsorship of the recently concluded Indian Premier League (IPL) held in Middle East.“Investors are betting Kunal (Shah) knows this industry better than anyone and can corner it quickly enough. They (Cred) can figure out a sizable revenue model as they go along,” said a second person aware of negotiations.DST's global interestApoletto Asia, the personal investment vehicle of DST chief Milner, is already an investor in Cred from its seed funding round in late 2018.After a quiet 2019 in India, DST Global is actively looking for deals.

Cars24 saw multiple factors playing in its favour. Firstly, demand for second-hand and cheaper vehicles post the pandemic, since people were reluctant to travel by public transport. Second, many consumers might be looking to sell their spare car, again helping Cars24 get business. Further, the company itself has forayed into the finance business, which might also have helped push up its valuation. The used-car business has a strong lending angle, too, which the company would want to tap into.Cashfree: Once Razorpay marched into the unicorn club, there was a strong buzz around other payment gateway players receiving investor interest too. Bengaluru-based profitable B2B payment solutions startup Cashfree got $35 million from a clutch of investors including Y Combinator, which is an investor in Razorpay too. Digital payments is a hot space now and with so many large businesses looking to sell online, there is a massive business opportunity for the likes of Cashfree.Country Delight: The buzz in the direct-to-home fresh food category continued this week as well, with Country Delight getting $25 million from Elevation (previously Saif Partners), Matrix Partners and others. The full stack digitised dairy retailing brand has shown strong growth even during the pandemic. Its quality and standard of products has helped it to stand out in a cluttered market dominated by the likes of Mother Dairy and Amul.Cityflo and Shipsy: Both early-stage startups received funding in their series A rounds. While Cityflo has become more relevant after the pandemic since it promotes digitisation of public transport ticketing, Shipsy has assumed significance with the need to digitise international shipping. Further, Shipsy is already making money and with the new round is looking to grow its business quickly.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/last-week-in-startup-funding-byjus-gets-another-200-million-valuation-touches-12-billion-cars24-cashfree-and-others-too-raise-funds-6165681.html,Funding,"Since the acquisition of White Hat Jr and the overall growth of the edtech sector post the COVID-19 pandemic, not just Byju’s, but multiple other companies in this space have been in the spotlight.Digital payments is a hot space now and with so many large businesses looking to sell online, there is a massive business opportunity for the likes of Cashfree.Country Delight: The buzz in the direct-to-home fresh food category continued this week as well, with Country Delight getting $25 million from Elevation (previously Saif Partners), Matrix Partners and others.","['White Hat Jr', 'COVID-19', 'Byju’s', 'Saif Partners', 'Matrix Partners']","['$200 million', '$12 billion', '$200 million', '$35 million', '$25 million']"
Low interest rates to continue for the next 6-12 months: Keki Mistry,26 November,"Stating that the existing home loan rates were the lowest in the last four decades, Keki Mistry, Vice Chairman and CEO, HDFC Ltd, said on November 26 the lower interest rates are likely to continue for another six to 12 months.He also observed that all real estate developers may not be able to avail the benefit of the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI's) one-time restructuring scheme as they might not meet the required financial ratios and have the necessary credit rating.""Restructuring may not necessarily help every developer because not too many will be able to meet the criteria laid down in terms of meeting the various ratios and getting credit ratings,” he observed.He was speaking at the ongoing virtual NAREDCO’s Real Estate and Infrastructure Investors’ Summit (REIIS) – 2020 in association with APREA.“The home loan rates have been the lowest in the last four decades. For the next six to 12 months, the benign interest rates environment will continue. The growth in the economy and the real estate has been sharp. The factors like the RBI infusing much needed liquidity into the sector, various concessions given by the government, and the developers like the stamp duty relaxations have extended the best buying opportunity for the homebuyers. The trend will continue with the lowest interest rates regime,” he said.COVID-19 VaccineFrequently Asked QuestionsA vaccine works by mimicking a natural infection. A vaccine not only induces immune response to protect people from any future COVID-19 infection, but also helps quickly build herd immunity to put an end to the pandemic. Herd immunity occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population becomes immune to a disease, making the spread of disease from person to person unlikely. The good news is that SARS-CoV-2 virus has been fairly stable, which increases the viability of a vaccine.There are broadly four types of vaccine — one, a vaccine based on the whole virus (this could be either inactivated, or an attenuated [weakened] virus vaccine); two, a non-replicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of SARS-CoV; three, nucleic-acid vaccines that have genetic material like DNA and RNA of antigens like spike protein given to a person, helping  human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine; and four, protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombinant proteins of SARS-COV-2 along with an adjuvant (booster) is given as a vaccine.Vaccine development is a long, complex process. Unlike drugs that are given to people with a diseased, vaccines are given to healthy people and also vulnerable sections such as children, pregnant women and the elderly. So rigorous tests are compulsory. History says that the fastest time it took to develop a vaccine is five years, but it usually takes double or sometimes triple that time.He, however, cautioned that the RBI may face some pressure owing to higher inflation that will reduce its ability to cut rates further.Benign interest rate regime will continue going forward and that rates will go up only after economic activity gathers more pace and inflation pressure rises, he said.He also observed that the banks are now distinguishing between the strong and weak developers for lending, hence improving the quality of balance sheets.“Avoid over-leveraging and stay well-capitalised,” he advised the developer community.""From a developer's perspective, the important learning, not just post-COVID but pre-COVID, is to just strengthen the balance sheet. Bring in more equity and do not over-leverage. The market will reward you for not over-leveraging. The more you leverage, the more pain you will face in the days to come,"" he said.Interest rates are a function of perception of credit risks, he said, adding that ""I think quality developers will, even today, be able to access money, not at 6.8 per cent or 6.9 per cent because the risk premium on a developer loan even from a prudential perspective is higher than what it is for an individual, but at relatively good rates"".However, weaker developers will find it difficult to raise money unless they improve the quality of their balance sheets, he said.Mistry said compared to six months ago, demand for residential properties now has picked up as people are beginning to believe that this is the best time to buy a property due to lower interest rates and as property prices have gone up in the last few years. At present, it is difficult to say whether non-performing loans (NPLs) in the real estate sector will come down in near future, he said.""I don't think that it is going to be that easy where suddenly overnight NPL are going to come down. You might even see an inching up of NPLs in the real estate sector, not significantly but slightly in one or two quarters before things stabilise, lets say two or three quarters down the line,"" Mistry said.He said consolidation in real estate sector can happen and should happen going forward, however, the problem is that it happens at project levels and not necessarily at entity level.He noted that the investments in creating co-working spaces will grow in the near future and more consolidation will happen at the project level.Commenting on the real estate trends this festive season during the COVID-19 pandemic, other real estate experts who spoke at the forum, said the residential real estate segment had registered a growth of 83 percent in the number of residential units and the growth in the sales value by 72 percent over the last year.Anuj Puri, Chairman and Founder of Anarock Property Consultants, observed that the affordable housing segment will continue to grow. “The residential sales in the July to September quarter is 67 percent of the Q1 sales of January to March 2020, which is a clear indication that the affordable housing segment is back in action,” he added.In the  commercial segment, Puri said this year, about 23 million sq ft of new office space leasing is expected while the REITs will continue to attract foreign investments.He informed that the rent collection has been between 97 percent to 99.5 percent during the April to October period that indicated a revival in the office segment.“The joint efforts of APREA and NAREDCO in liasioning with the government to boost the REITs framework in the country have driven heavy investments in this segment,” he added.“The start of the pandemic saw a few months of zero sales but soon people realized the value of owning a home which saw a severe turnaround. The volume will increase in the coming months and we expect the momentum to continue,” said Neel Raheja, President, K Raheja Corp.“On the commercial front, the new leasing market has been slow due to the uncertainty of the pandemic. We are seeing a trend of offices shifting from Nariman Point to BKC; few of the companies are also preferring to move to far-off areas like Navi Mumbai, Thane, etc. Also, we can see 75-80% of the demand for offices is coming from the global companies. People cannot continue to work from home for a longer period of time and we expect the commercial market to be back once things start to move slowly,” he added.He also cautioned developers against increasing prices at this stage, saying that it would lead to a decline in volumes.Vikram Garg, Managing Director, Blackstone, observed that as the global interest rates have been low, the global fund managers are bullish on the country like India. The domestic individuals have founded a great investment class in REITs, which has created large investment opportunities as a saving instrument.Sharing insights into the SWAMIH Fund, Irfan A. Kazi, Chief Investment Officer, SWAMIH Investment Fund said: “In our funded projects, the emphasis will entirely be on construction. The developer has to complete the project regardless of whether the sales are happening or not. The fundamental reason why this funding is coming-in is based on the premise that the completed inventory will sell. The SWAMIH funding is not only for stalled projects but it is also for the stressed projects where the pace of construction has been hampered due to lack of funding.”The government’s Special Window for Affordable and Mid-Income Housing (SWAMIH) was set up in November last year to provide last-mile funding for stalled real estate projects by the government.SBI CAP is the fund manager of SWAMIH Fund.The fund was to help complete over 1,500 stalled housing projects, including those that have been declared NPAs (non-performing assets) or admitted for insolvency proceedings. The move is likely to help 4.58 lakh housing units across the country. Only RERA-registered projects with the positive net worth will be provided with funds.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/real-estate/low-interest-rates-to-continue-for-the-next-6-12-months-keki-mistry-6161081-6161081.html,Funding,"You might even see an inching up of NPLs in the real estate sector, not significantly but slightly in one or two quarters before things stabilise, lets say two or three quarters down the line,"" Mistry said.He said consolidation in real estate sector can happen and should happen going forward, however, the problem is that it happens at project levels and not necessarily at entity level.He noted that the investments in creating co-working spaces will grow in the near future and more consolidation will happen at the project level.Commenting on the real estate trends this festive season during the COVID-19 pandemic, other real estate experts who spoke at the forum, said the residential real estate segment had registered a growth of 83 percent in the number of residential units and the growth in the sales value by 72 percent over the last year.Anuj Puri, Chairman and Founder of Anarock Property Consultants, observed that the affordable housing segment will continue to grow.“The residential sales in the July to September quarter is 67 percent of the Q1 sales of January to March 2020, which is a clear indication that the affordable housing segment is back in action,” he added.In the  commercial segment, Puri said this year, about 23 million sq ft of new office space leasing is expected while the REITs will continue to attract foreign investments.He informed that the rent collection has been between 97 percent to 99.5 percent during the April to October period that indicated a revival in the office segment.“The joint efforts of APREA and NAREDCO in liasioning with the government to boost the REITs framework in the country have driven heavy investments in this segment,” he added.“The start of the pandemic saw a few months of zero sales but soon people realized the value of owning a home which saw a severe turnaround.","['COVID-19', 'Founder of Anarock Property Consultants', 'Puri', 'APREA', 'NAREDCO']","['6.8 per cent', '6.9 per cent']"
Centre cuts scholarship funding for 60 lakh SC students,26 November,"The scholarship for more than 60 lakh scheduled caste (SC) category students of Class 11 and 12 is stopped across 14 states as the Centre has stopped funding their portion of the scheme as per the 2017 formula, The Economic Times reported.The issue is pending before the Union Cabinet for over a year and was discussed in detail by the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) and Prime Minister Narendra Modi in early November, it said.Originally, expense for the All India Post Matric Scholarship Scheme was borne jointly by states and the Centre, but the latter has been providing only 10 percent since 2017-18 under “committed liability” – from which point states began discontinuing or scaling it down for want of funds.Committed liability is the expenditure mandated for states and union territories to be incurred for the Five Year Plan period per year under Centrally Sponsored Schemes of Scholarships, against which further funding from the Centre is facilitated.The meeting discussed how the Finance Ministry’s push on committed liability placed 90 percent of the burden on states, reducing the Centre’s contribution from 60 percent to 10 percent during the 12th Finance Commission period (2018), the report said.During the meeting it was also noted that this scheme is the only centrally sponsored one to not follow the 60:40 formula, which has led to “strong objections” from states that say the condition has become “the biggest hurdle” as they are expected to “cough up huge funds.”Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh, Punjab, Haryana, Bihar, West Bengal, Jharkhand, Maharashtra and Telangana have repeatedly taken up the matter with the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment, as per the report.It added that the Social Justice Ministry has in turn requested the Finance Ministry to revert to the 60:40 formula and release funding for hostels, maintenance and tuition fees.The scheme is vital as it provides eligible senior minority students with 100 percent scholarship and scheduled tribe (ST) candidates with 75 percent scholarship to complete their education.

Exclusive: PE fund Kedaara eyes record $1 billion third fund,11 November,"Homegrown private equity firm Kedaara Capital is in talks to raise a billion dollar fund, its third and largest so far, on the back of successful exits and investor interest for top fund managers, said two people aware of the matter, requesting anonymity.Kedaara is an investor in firms including AU Small Finance Bank, packaging firm Manjushree Technopack and eyewear retailer Lenskart among others.Kedaara was started in 2011 by former Temasek India head Manish Kejriwal, General Atlantic managing director Sunish Sharma and General Atlantic Principal Nishant Sharma.“They have deployed about 75 percent of their current fund and have just begun conversations for the third fund. LPs (limited partners) are quite bullish and they could raise between $950 to a billion” said a person aware of negotiations.It last raised a $750 million second fund in mid 2017, from which its investments include wholesaler Vishal Mega Mart, auto components firm Sunbeam Auto and small business lender Veritas Finance, among others. Prior to that, it raised a $540 million debut fund in 2013, one of the largest by a local fund at the time.Investors in Kedaara- its LPs- include Canadian pension funds CDPQ and Ontario Teachers Pension Plan, German insurer Allianz and the International Finance Corporation (IFC) among others.If it does raise a billion dollars for the third fund, it will be the largest so far by a homegrown PE brand. Multiples PE, founded by Renuka Ramnath, is currently raising a $900 million fund, while ChrysCapital raised an $850 million fund- its eighth, in early 2019.“They have established themselves as a reliable PE brand, so even during a pandemic they can raise a large fund,” said another person tracking the firm, who did not want to be named.Kedaara declined to comment.Kedaara is generally open to acquire a minority or majority stake in companies established sectors. One of its largest deals was investing about Rs 5000 crore along with Partners Group to acquire Vishal Mega Mart in 2018, while it invested about Rs 350 crore in Veritas Finance in March this year.It has also been able to clock exits consistently- a key metric for funds, especially as funds get larger, exits also have to get larger to justify large fund sizes. For instance, it earned a 6x exit on an investment of Rs 150 crore in Manjushree, when Advent International acquired a majority stake in late 2018. Some of its companies such as AU Small Finance, Mahindra Logistics, micro lender Spandana Sphoorty and Aavas Financiers have also listed in the stock markets, giving Kedaara part or full exits.More recently, Kedaara has also been refining its strategy and eyeing stakes in late stage consumer internet startups, such as Lenskart. It also considered investing in fantasy gaming platform Dream11 and beauty and makeup retailer Nykaa, according to media reports and two people aware of the matter, but eventually did not pull the trigger.This is similar to global private equity giants such as TPG and General Atlantic, which have been active in technology and internet investing in India.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/exclusive-pe-fund-kedaara-eyes-record-1-billion-third-fund-6099851.html,Funding,"Homegrown private equity firm Kedaara Capital is in talks to raise a billion dollar fund, its third and largest so far, on the back of successful exits and investor interest for top fund managers, said two people aware of the matter, requesting anonymity.Kedaara is an investor in firms including AU Small Finance Bank, packaging firm Manjushree Technopack and eyewear retailer Lenskart among others.Kedaara was started in 2011 by former Temasek India head Manish Kejriwal, General Atlantic managing director Sunish Sharma and General Atlantic Principal Nishant Sharma.“They have deployed about 75 percent of their current fund and have just begun conversations for the third fund.Prior to that, it raised a $540 million debut fund in 2013, one of the largest by a local fund at the time.Investors in Kedaara- its LPs- include Canadian pension funds CDPQ and Ontario Teachers Pension Plan, German insurer Allianz and the International Finance Corporation (IFC) among others.If it does raise a billion dollars for the third fund, it will be the largest so far by a homegrown PE brand.","['Kedaara Capital', 'AU Small Finance Bank', 'Manjushree Technopack', 'CDPQ', 'Ontario Teachers Pension Plan', 'Allianz', 'the International Finance Corporation', 'PE']","['a billion dollar', 'between $950', '$750 million', '$540 million', 'a billion dollars', '$900 million', '$850 million']"
BitClass raises $2 million in seed funding led by Venture Highway,10 November,"Bengaluru-based startup BitClass, which offers a platform for independent teachers to conduct online classes, has raised $2 million in seed funding led by Venture Highway. This seed funding round is led by Venture Highway with participation from AET Japan, Figure Eight Investments, and Waterbridge Ventures.Set up in April 2020, BitClass has 2,200 active teachers on the platform right now. In an interaction with Moneycontrol, Gunjan Kejriwal, co-founder of BitClass, said that the idea is to help teachers become entrepreneurs which he calls ‘teacherpreneurs’.“This funding round will help grow the business and also make the technology more intuitive. The vision is to also increase the earnings of the teachers on our platform,” he added.For paid classes, BitClass earns a commission out of the fee paid to the teachers. Here, it is not just regular academic lessons and competitive exam preparatory lectures offered by teachers but also offbeat lessons like DIY mask, jewellery design, chocolate making and yoga.Kejriwal added that BitClass will be looking to raise another round of funding in the next 6-10 months. He added that the platform wants to have 1 million teachers earning Rs 50,000 plus in the near future. Right now, the average earning per teacher is Rs 15,000.Clarifying that BitClass is not just a video-conferencing solution, Kejriwal added that the platform helps teachers establish an online presence and manage their existing workflows better, reach and acquire new potential learners efficiently, without much marketing and technology know-how. He added that the use of video conferencing tools is inbuilt into the product.Priya Mohan, Startup Sensei at Venture Highway, said that their investment in Bitclass stemmed from our belief both in the founding team and the problem they are solving.“COVID-19 has induced significant tailwinds for online/live services. However, in our view, models should be calibrated for post-COVID-19 scenarios with a longer-term view accounting for potential behaviour changes. We found Gunjan’s and Utsav’s insights into building a solution for ‘teacherpreneurs’ offering live instructional content unique,” she added.Venture Highway is backed by investors from Silicon Valley and is a dedicated seed fund, which partners with the Indian technology entrepreneurs by providing guidance and early rounds of institutional capital.Industry estimates suggest that the edtech sector has been the biggest gainer of the COVID-19 lockdown across educational institutions in India.

Small-town startups | How Karma Healthcare’s founder went from Goldman Sachs to serving village patients from Udaipur,04 November,"For years, Jagdeep Gambhir’s neighbours wondered why an alumnus of one of India’s leading business schools (ISB) and former Goldman Sachs analyst left a respectable job in New Delhi to return to Udaipur and tinker in a tiny office with a few people.For the co-founder and CEO of Karma Primary Healthcare Services Private Ltd, the neighbours’ scepticism encapsulates the experience of starting up in a smaller city, away from the hype and noise, but focussed on the challenge.Gambhir’s startup sets up clinics across villages in North India, where a doctor shortage and consultations from fake doctors are all too common. Karma sets up a physical clinic where a nurse facilitates a video call with doctors all over the country. It currently has 25 clinics spread across Rajasthan, Haryana and Madhya Pradesh, and serves 100-150 patients a day.And for his model, his hometown of Udaipur seems an apt base, if a challenging one. “Our cost base is lower in a small city; rent and talent is cheaper. For example, even during the pandemic, we weren’t forced to shut down our physical office, like firms in big cities. Having a low cost base is crucial. For our model, the revenue is there, the scale is what we have to find,” Gambhir says.Challenging environmentToday, 34-year-old Gambhir seems more settled and in sync with his company and its 80-odd employees, but starting up in Udaipur was not easy.Technology talent to build software capability was not available, and an ecosystem- to raise money, hire people and network is absent.“People don’t understand the startup culture so well here. In the early days, at 6pm, someone would say, ‘Okay let’s pick this up tomorrow’. And I would say, ‘No, let's finish it today!’ And with that passion and interest, people would wonder if I’m on steroids,” Gambhir recalls.Even today, more so after the coronavirus pandemic hit, Karma’s employees are outside Udaipur. While outreach workers are in the villages they need to target, he found tech talent in Delhi, and doctors all over, from Hisar (Haryana) to Bengaluru.“Access to talent does become a problem, so you have to look a little outside. But being in a small city gives us a lower cost base and lower rentals, which is crucial,” he said.Speaking to Gambhir, the focus on impact comes through. Words like impact, mission-driven and community pepper the conversation. In villages, income levels are low, so the average patient is rarely forking out more than a hundred rupees. But Karma is funded by impact investing firm Ankur Capital and angel fund 1Crowd — return-seeking investors.Gambhir says the revenue is there, not only from core consultations, but from selling medicines — either each Karma clinic has its own pharmacy or it ties up with a nearby one — and by selling related services. For example, Karma now offers eye and ear care too, in addition to health insurance, for which it has tied up with Aditya Birla.Balancing business and growth along with the impact and mission of primary care — the company’s ‘karma’, if you will — is a challenge. The six-year-old startup had a revenue of Rs 2.9 crore for FY20, and Gambhir says this gives Karma some legitimacy and scale, ahead of another fundraise it is eyeing in the next six months.Eyeing steady growth“We are not going to burst out with rapid growth, but I think steady growth is good enough to give our investors at least a 3-4x exit. I believe that if you solve a real problem for the customer, there is money to be made. So we have a clear business,” he says.Gambhir compares Karma to Rahul Dravid, renowned Indian cricketer and a beacon of stability, rather than Virender Sehwag, a swashbuckling, fast-scoring but often unreliable batsman,Like many startups, the pandemic also made Karma grow up overnight and evolve every aspect of its business. While earlier a nurse would assist the patient to do a video call on a large screen TV in the clinic, this has given way to a fully contactless updated tele-consultation software, which Karma built a few days into the lockdown. The service, combined with its COVID-19 response, has catered to over one lakh people.Gambhir also got a vote of confidence from late President Pranab Mukherjee, in what he says is one of Karma’s biggest moments so far. When the President was looking for ways to improve rural India via his foundation, healthcare was touted as a key issue, and Karma was touted as a solution. The President’s office got in touch with Gambhir and told Karma to open more centres in Haryana with the President’s support. Karma is currently listed as an official partner of the Pranab Mukherjee Foundation.“In Udaipur, there isn’t even a startup ecosystem. That lack of an ecosystem makes it tough at times. But validation from the President gave us a lot of credibility. Our mission is clear. It is hard, but that’s why I like it,” Gambhir says.Follow the entire Small-Town Startups series here.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/trends/features/head-small-town-startups-how-karma-healthcares-founder-went-from-goldman-sachs-to-serving-village-patients-from-udaipur-6064771.html,Funding,"For years, Jagdeep Gambhir’s neighbours wondered why an alumnus of one of India’s leading business schools (ISB) and former Goldman Sachs analyst left a respectable job in New Delhi to return to Udaipur and tinker in a tiny office with a few people.For the co-founder and CEO of Karma Primary Healthcare Services Private Ltd, the neighbours’ scepticism encapsulates the experience of starting up in a smaller city, away from the hype and noise, but focussed on the challenge.Gambhir’s startup sets up clinics across villages in North India, where a doctor shortage and consultations from fake doctors are all too common.For our model, the revenue is there, the scale is what we have to find,” Gambhir says.Challenging environmentToday, 34-year-old Gambhir seems more settled and in sync with his company and its 80-odd employees, but starting up in Udaipur was not easy.Technology talent to build software capability was not available, and an ecosystem- to raise money, hire people and network is absent.“People don’t understand the startup culture so well here.","['Goldman Sachs', 'Karma Primary Healthcare Services Private Ltd']",[]

Healthcare startups globally raise record $21.8 billion in Q32020,27 October,"Healthcare startups globally raised a record $21.8 billion in funding last quarter, led by a spike in digital healthcare solutions, which have become more important during the pandemic as people stay at home.Healthcare investments grew 18 percent quarter-on-quarter from $18.4 billion, while the number of deals also rose from 1,299 to 1,539, according to a report from CB Insights, a market intelligence platform.Digital health startups raised $8.4 billion in the September quarter, 73 percent more than the previous quarter, across 508 deals, only 8 percent more than the previous quarter.

A vaccine not only induces immune response to protect people from any future COVID-19 infection, but also helps quickly build herd immunity to put an end to the pandemic. Herd immunity occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population becomes immune to a disease, making the spread of disease from person to person unlikely. The good news is that SARS-CoV-2 virus has been fairly stable, which increases the viability of a vaccine.There are broadly four types of vaccine — one, a vaccine based on the whole virus (this could be either inactivated, or an attenuated [weakened] virus vaccine); two, a non-replicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of SARS-CoV; three, nucleic-acid vaccines that have genetic material like DNA and RNA of antigens like spike protein given to a person, helping  human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine; and four, protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombinant proteins of SARS-COV-2 along with an adjuvant (booster) is given as a vaccine.Vaccine development is a long, complex process. Unlike drugs that are given to people with a diseased, vaccines are given to healthy people and also vulnerable sections such as children, pregnant women and the elderly. So rigorous tests are compulsory.

Exclusive: Kunal Shah’s Cred in talks to raise funds; aiming a valuation of nearly $800 million,09 October,"Credit card repayment startup and second venture of Freecharge co-founder Kunal Shah, Cred, is in talks to raise nearly $100 million at a valuation ranging between $700 million and $800 million, three people aware of the matter told Moneycontrol, requesting anonymity.At least half of this fundraising will be contributed by existing investors like Sequoia Capital, Tiger Global Management and Hillhouse Capital. While the deal is far from being closed, new investors in this round could include Falcon Edge Capital and Belgian investment firm Sofina, among others, sources quoted above said.Shah, Falcon Edge and Sofina did not respond to mails seeking comment.Cred is a mobile application where customers make their credit card payments in lieu of Cred points that could be used for various discounts and offers on the platform. Cred has partnered with companies such as online fashion retailer Myntra, fitness startup Curefit, and Samsung to provide offers and discounts.Cred’s growth has also been driven by its marketing campaign during the ongoing Indian Premier League (IPL) cricket tournament. Over the last few weeks, users signing up to use Cred have risen 6-7 times, Shailendra Singh, managing director at Sequoia Capital and a board member of Cred, tweeted on September 24.Cred was valued at $450 million in August last year when it raised $120 million in Series A round from a number of top technology investors such as Ribbit Capital, General Catalyst, Greenoaks Capital, Dragoneer Investment Group and Apoletto Asia- the personal investment vehicle of Israeli-Russian billionaire Yuri Milner.Before this, Cred raised $30 million in a seed-funding round in late 2018, one of the largest seed rounds in Indian startups.“The valuation can be attributed to their IPL-led growth, but for investors, investing in a second time founder is seen as a relatively safe bet,” said a person tracking the company, who did not want to be named.If Falcon Edge does invest, it is likely to invest via Alpha Wave Incubation, a $300 million fund whose sole investor is Abu Dhabi’s ADQ- a state-owned company having stakes in its non-oil assets.Last week, Cred also appointed Miten Sampat, who was previously the Chief Strategy Officer at Times Internet. His exact role at Cred, barring helping with growth, is unknown.In 2015, Shah sold Freecharge to Snapdeal for $400 million, at the time. In 2017, Axis Bank acquired FreeCharge from Snapdeal for Rs 385 crore.Investors are betting that Cred can monetize its current user base- the country’s most loan-worthy customers with a credit score of 750 and above, and lend to them.

Our aim is to enable tutors in India to go digital and improve the quality of learning for students,” Winuall CEO Ashwini Purohit said.The company will use the funds to enhance its product and also hire across technology, product and business development verticals. It has set a target of adding more than 20,000 coaching institutes and serve more than three million students across the country by the end of 2021.Founded in 2019 by Purohit and Saurabh Vyas, Winuall offers a SaaS plug-and-play platform on a subscription model for tutors and coaching institutes.COVID-19 VaccineFrequently Asked QuestionsA vaccine works by mimicking a natural infection. A vaccine not only induces immune response to protect people from any future COVID-19 infection, but also helps quickly build herd immunity to put an end to the pandemic. Herd immunity occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population becomes immune to a disease, making the spread of disease from person to person unlikely. The good news is that SARS-CoV-2 virus has been fairly stable, which increases the viability of a vaccine.There are broadly four types of vaccine — one, a vaccine based on the whole virus (this could be either inactivated, or an attenuated [weakened] virus vaccine); two, a non-replicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of SARS-CoV; three, nucleic-acid vaccines that have genetic material like DNA and RNA of antigens like spike protein given to a person, helping  human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine; and four, protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombinant proteins of SARS-COV-2 along with an adjuvant (booster) is given as a vaccine.Vaccine development is a long, complex process. Unlike drugs that are given to people with a diseased, vaccines are given to healthy people and also vulnerable sections such as children, pregnant women and the elderly. So rigorous tests are compulsory. History says that the fastest time it took to develop a vaccine is five years, but it usually takes double or sometimes triple that time.These centres, typically run by a single teacher or a group of tutors, can become fully digitised through this solution. It brings into play tools like live classes, online quizzes, online courses and others.Winuall has more than 3,700 coaching institutes on board across the country, with over 5000 tutors using the platform.

"Investment startup smallcase raises $14 million from DSP, Sequoia and others",28 September,"Investment startup smallcase has raised a $14 million in Series B round led by financial services firm DSP, Sequoia Capital India and existing investors Blume Ventures, Beenext and WEH Ventures.New investors include Arkam Ventures, a new India-focused Rs 700 crore fund, Cred founder Kunal Shah and Utpal, the CEO of Rare Enterprises that is owned by renowned investor Rakesh Jhunjhunwala.Founded in 2015 by Vasanth Kamath, Rohan Gupta and Anugrah Shrivastava, ""smallcases"" are model portfolios of stocks and exchange- traded funds (ETFs) that are created and managed by registered individuals and entities and accessible to retail investors.The smallcase platform is integrated with India’s largest brokers, including Zerodha, HDFC Securities, Kotak Securities, 5Paisa and AxisDirect, to offer ""smallcases"" to their clients. Smallcase CEO Vasanth Kamath estimates there are about 2 million users and about Rs 5,000 crore has been transacted in smallcases.Earlier this year, smallcase launched its gateway offering, which helps any app to provide stock, ETF & smallcase transactions in a native, secure and compliant manner. Eleven apps and platforms, including Moneycontrol, SBI Mutual Fund, Nippon AMC, Kuvera, have integrated the smallcase gateway to power stock & ETF transactions.While smallcase has, so far, operated by selling its platform and service to brokerages, making it a business-to-business firm, it also wants to reach out to consumers directly.“Many consumer and retail investors still don’t know about us, so increasing awareness by reaching out directly is a focus, which is why we also launched our own app in April,” Kamath told Moneycontrol.In the next few years, Kamath thinks direct transactions can grow to about 25 percent of its overall business, indicating brokerages and other wealth management platforms will still be a priority.“The desire to shift savings from banks to capital markets is hindered by high costs and structural issues like undersupply of passive investment options.

These are the startups that may go for IPO in 2021-22,21 September,"The recent change in the law to allow Indian companies to list overseas first comes as a big boost to Indian startups, many of whom are loss-making and thus unable to list in India, and whose investors are looking for an exit- which an IPO will give them. There are, however, other challenges. Whether the US stock markets will give these startups the valuation they want, is uncertain. Further, while IPOs are considered a sign of maturity and almost regarded as a badge of honour for startups, from the company’s point of view, staying private is a much better option, as it has to cater to fewer shareholders, regulation and disclosure norms are less exhaustive and regular share price fluctuation is not a concern. The decision will finally come down to internal objectives, whether investors need to cash out soon, and broader economic sentiment.These are the startups which are considering an IPO in the next few years:Flipkart: The Walmart-owned e-commerce firm has been eyeing a US IPO for a while now, according to reports, although it has no immediate funding shortage given its cash-rich parent and other investors. Mint reported on September 16 that the coronavirus pandemic has accelerated digitisation and online buying, from which Flipkart has gained. Due to this, it may go for an IPO as soon as next year, at a valuation of $40-45 billion, the report said, more than double the $21 billion for which Walmart acquired it in 2018. For FY19, Flipkart’s revenue grew 42 percent to Rs 43,515 crore, while it cut losses by 63 percent to Rs 17, 231 crore. Freshworks: Software provider Freshworks raised $150 million in November last year, tripling its valuation to $3.5 billion, and according to reports and sources, this was supposed to be its last private round before a US NASDAQ IPO in 2021. However, the COVID-19 pandemic pushed these plans. But Freshworks is still one of the few profitable unicorns and with the US being its largest market, an IPO there could do well. In an interview with Moneycontrol in June, CEO Girish Mathrubootham said, “We are actively focusing on building the business, driving growth in new markets and strengthening our position in existing markets. We will aim for an IPO if and when a public offering proves opportune for the business.”Policybazaar: Insurance aggregator Policybazaar is another startup closer to an IPO than many, given it is profitable, and still growing. Group CEO Yashish Dahiya wants to list in Mumbai next year, he told Bloomberg in June, but after the change in law, it may also go for a dual listing. Policybazaar wants to go public at a valuation of $3.5 billion, more than double the $1.5 billion it was valued at in July this year, when existing investor SoftBank invested $130 million for primary and secondary shares. Zomato: Food delivery firm Zomato is a surprise candidate here, given that food delivery and eating out has been one of the worst-hit sectors from the pandemic. Even six months on, most players in the space have seen order volumes recover to only 50-60% of pre-pandemic levels. Despite this, on the back of a fundraising spree, Zomato CEO Deepinder Goyal told employees in an email that it is planning for an IPO in the first half of 2021. ""Our finance/legal teams are working hard to take us to IPO sometime in the first half of next year. The value of our business is going up dramatically, all thanks to the hard work and commitment of our team. We hope to create a lot of value for our current employees who have Esops sometime in the next year,” Goyal said. For FY20, Zomato’s revenue doubled to $394 million, while losses rose about 5% to $293 million.Nykaa:  Online beauty and cosmetics retailer Nykaa has been a candidate for a domestic IPO for a few years now, given that it is profitable, and still growing. For FY19, its revenue doubled to Rs 1,159 crore and had a meagre profit of Rs 2 crore. The COVID-19 pandemic hit Nykaa for a few months, but CEO Falguni Nayar told the Economic Times in June that it would be at 75 percent of pre-pandemic levels by July and it plans for an IPO in the next 2 years. Nykaa also became a unicorn this year, and was valued at $1.2 billion in AprilDelhivery: E-commerce logistics firm Delhivery was said to be preparing for an IPO in 2018, and had started reaching out to bankers, when it ended up raising money from the SoftBank Vision Fund instead and decided to stay private longer. Since then it has also raised funds from Canadian pension fund CPPIB, and is valued at $1.5 billion. Delhivery is now planning for an IPO in the next 12-18 months, Chief Business Officer Sandeep Barasia told Mint on September 16. With the law amended, it may choose to list abroad, and not in India. For FY19, Delhivery’s revenue grew 58 percent to Rs 1,694 crore while losses rose 160 percent to Rs 1,781 crore.These are the most likely candidates for an IPO in the next few years. However, a slew of other startups including Lenskart, Pepperfry, Oyo, Paytm and Mobikwik has also spoken about listing ambitions in the past. It is unclear whether their plans have changed post the pandemic, or whether it is a priority above other things.  ",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/startup/these-are-the-startups-that-may-go-for-ipo-in-2021-22-5865431.html,Funding,"The recent change in the law to allow Indian companies to list overseas first comes as a big boost to Indian startups, many of whom are loss-making and thus unable to list in India, and whose investors are looking for an exit- which an IPO will give them.The decision will finally come down to internal objectives, whether investors need to cash out soon, and broader economic sentiment.These are the startups which are considering an IPO in the next few years:Flipkart: The Walmart-owned e-commerce firm has been eyeing a US IPO for a while now, according to reports, although it has no immediate funding shortage given its cash-rich parent and other investors.","['IPO', 'IPO', 'Walmart', 'IPO']","['40', '$21 billion', '$150 million', '$3.5 billion', '$3.5 billion', '$1.5 billion', '$130 million', '$394 million', '$293 million', '$1.2 billion', '$1.5 billion']"
COVID-19 impact: Residential-realty demand to halve this fiscal; prices likely to correct by 5-15%,15 September,"With the COVID-19 pandemic crushing economic activity and with it, big-ticket spending, it is survival of the fittest with small to mid-sized developers staring at a huge funding gap. The already languishing residential real estate demand is expected to plunge 50-70 percent on-year in the current fiscal, a report has said.As a result, the credit profiles of small-to-mid-sized and leveraged developers will be impacted than larger, experienced developers with healthy balance sheets, CRISIL said.With demand going down, capital values will remain under pressure across cities. CRISIL expects a price correction of 5-15 percent across ticket sizes.Demand for the sector has been subdued over the past decade, on account of a raft of factors: demonetisation, unaffordability, delay in completions etc. While income and employment generation remain monitorable, a mild recovery in residential demand might be expected in the second half of the current fiscal, in the baseline case.“Lowering capital values and attractive interest rates augur well for affordability which has improved by 10-30 percent across cities during the past five years- as measured by CRISIL’s proprietary index MAHTI. Despite improved affordability, demand translation will be feeble led by income uncertainty arising from pandemic coupled with weak investor sentiment emanating from pressure on capital appreciation / rental yields in the sector over the past few years,” says Isha Chaudhary, Director, CRISIL Research.COVID-19 VaccineFrequently Asked QuestionsA vaccine works by mimicking a natural infection. A vaccine not only induces immune response to protect people from any future COVID-19 infection, but also helps quickly build herd immunity to put an end to the pandemic. Herd immunity occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population becomes immune to a disease, making the spread of disease from person to person unlikely. The good news is that SARS-CoV-2 virus has been fairly stable, which increases the viability of a vaccine.There are broadly four types of vaccine — one, a vaccine based on the whole virus (this could be either inactivated, or an attenuated [weakened] virus vaccine); two, a non-replicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of SARS-CoV; three, nucleic-acid vaccines that have genetic material like DNA and RNA of antigens like spike protein given to a person, helping  human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine; and four, protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombinant proteins of SARS-COV-2 along with an adjuvant (booster) is given as a vaccine.Vaccine development is a long, complex process. Unlike drugs that are given to people with a diseased, vaccines are given to healthy people and also vulnerable sections such as children, pregnant women and the elderly. So rigorous tests are compulsory. History says that the fastest time it took to develop a vaccine is five years, but it usually takes double or sometimes triple that time.While demand for new units will see a sharp decline, the blow to customer collections will be cushioned by advances against already sold inventory realised in line with construction progress.The one-time relief for Real Estate Regulatory Authority (RERA)-registered projects would provide players an option to manage outflows through flexibility to delay construction spend. Postponing capex and land banking plans could be another way, it said.Funding requirements to increase; larger players to manage betterHowever, overall funding requirements are expected to rise as the hit in collections is expected to be far steeper than the decline in outflows due to deferred construction.That said, large diversified players with strong delivery track record are expected to manage better as indicated by an analysis of the top 10 CRISIL-rated developer groups.“Larger, established developers have ample financial flexibility, with debt-to-total assets ratio (a measure of leverage) estimated at a five-year low of around 30 percent as of end-fiscal 2020. Many will also have access to steady income from operational commercial assets. We estimate the increase in funding requirements for these players at only 15-25 percent higher than pre-pandemic estimates,” says Sushmita Majumdar, Director, CRISIL Ratings.Small developers to feel the pinchThe situation, however, is far bleaker for developers on the other side of the spectrum, as per CRISIL’s analysis of more than 100 small developers and single-project special purpose vehicles.Small-to-mid-sized developers will face a sharp 200 percent rise in funding gap this fiscal. But their ability to borrow or raise capital is limited as debt-to-total assets ratio is significantly high at around 75 percent as of March 2020.Interest cover is also weak, at 1.2-1.5 times versus around 2.0 times for the large developer groups.Tie-ups with larger players imminentGiven tight liquidity, some of these players will be vying for tie-ups with larger established names by way of joint ventures, joint development agreements, and development models to benefit from their processes and financial flexibility, or resort to distress sale of assets to raise funds.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/real-estate/covid-19-impact-battered-residential-realty-demand-to-halve-this-fiscal-prices-likely-to-correct-by-5-15-5843021.html,Funding,"The good news is that SARS-CoV-2 virus has been fairly stable, which increases the viability of a vaccine.There are broadly four types of vaccine — one, a vaccine based on the whole virus (this could be either inactivated, or an attenuated [weakened] virus vaccine); two, a non-replicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of SARS-CoV; three, nucleic-acid vaccines that have genetic material like DNA and RNA of antigens like spike protein given to a person, helping  human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine; and four, protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombinant proteins of SARS-COV-2 along with an adjuvant (booster) is given as a vaccine.Vaccine development is a long, complex process.Postponing capex and land banking plans could be another way, it said.Funding requirements to increase; larger players to manage betterHowever, overall funding requirements are expected to rise as the hit in collections is expected to be far steeper than the decline in outflows due to deferred construction.That said, large diversified players with strong delivery track record are expected to manage better as indicated by an analysis of the top 10 CRISIL-rated developer groups.“Larger, established developers have ample financial flexibility, with debt-to-total assets ratio (a measure of leverage) estimated at a five-year low of around 30 percent as of end-fiscal 2020.",['RNA'],[]
"Dream11's parent firm raises $225 million from Tiger Global, TPG, ChrysCapital",14 September,"Dream Sports, the parent firm of fantasy gaming platform Dream11, has raised $225 million in a funding round from Tiger Global Management, private equity firms TPG and ChrysCapital and Footpath Ventures, the company said on September 14.The fundraise comes less than a month after Dream11 bagged the title sponsorship rights for the Indian Premier League (IPL), the cricket tournament which drives the majority of its revenue.While the company did not disclose its valuation, a source said it was valued at $2.5 billion.

Our vision is to ‘Make Sports Better’ for India and Indian fans through sports technology and innovation,” Jain said.Founded by Jain and Bhavit Sheth in 2012, Dream11 offers games such as cricket, kabaddi and football. Its official partners include IPL, the International Cricket Council (ICC) and the National Basketball Association (NBA).The parent company Dream Sports also runs streaming app FanCode and sports accelerator DreamX.While fantasy gaming is a seasonal business, it is also seen as one of the most profitable ones.Chinese internet giant Tencent is a minority investor in Dream11. The deal will help Dream11 broaden its investor base as the border standoff continues between the two countries and India steps up scrutiny of investment coming from China.Indian startups have thrived on Chinese investment but will now have to look elsewhere as anti-China sentiment gains ground.“We have grown from one to many brands and from 200 Sportans (employees of Dream Sports) to 450 in the last two years.

Excitement is back in startup world as venture capitalists return,10 September,"Venture capitalists are slowly returning to the startup world. The doom and gloom following COVID-19 is giving way to cautious optimism.Investors are now writing big cheques, making big bets and taking risks, something that was expected to take much longer.Content startups like Dailyhunt and ShareChat, fantasy gaming platform Dream11, skincare brand WOW Skin Sciences, and meat delivery startup Licious are companies where deal discussions have heated up.“Select startups today are actually closing rounds much faster. While a deal negotiation would have taken even a year earlier, we are seeing terms close in less than a month now. This is an opportunity window for the market leaders in these recovery segments to leap forward much faster than they expected,” says Pranav Pai, founding partner at 3one4 Capital, an early-stage fund.The worst is overWhen the pandemic hit India, investors hit the panic button- pulling out of nearly-done deals, postponing their own fundraising, having tough discussions on layoffs with no revenue for the foreseeable future, and bracing for smaller companies to shut down or sell out.Now, even other legacy sectors, ones hit by the pandemic and benefiting from it but not restricted to food-delivery, logistics, online content, software-as-a-service (Saas) and consumer brands, are also benefiting.“Signals show that the early excitement is returning. The worst of the correction is past us and there is a growing sentiment of relief. At least there is not as much unbounded uncertainty on recovery estimates and paths forward,” says Pai.The only significant change is that no major venture fund will back a purely offline-based startup, or even one largely reliant on offline sales. As investors chase the consumer internet theme, this trend was arguably closing in anyway.Further, many internet subsectors have actually gained from the lockdown. As people stay at home for record periods of time, online services such as grocery delivery, video-based commerce and ordering online across sectors is seeing more first-time users.India’s e-commerce is set to grow faster than expected -- at a compounded annual growth rate of 19.6 percent, according to GlobalData, a London-based data analytics firm. This would give the Indian e-commerce sector a market size of Rs 7 trillion by 2023. And startups are gaining from this.The shift in sentiment is also important because in the startup space, a lot is determined by expectations and outlooks, than on-ground performance or numbers, compared to other sectors, and that early- stage investors tend to take a long-term view.“Early-stage sentiment, especially, is strong now. April was the only month where we were really worried. We discussed and realised that we are investing with a seven-year horizon. Now, if I take that view, then COVID, no matter how bad, should be a blip in the larger scheme,” says Rutvik Doshi, managing director at Inventus Capital India, an early-stage investor.Edtech still a big drawIn March and April, at the height of India’s lockdown, online education, healthcare and gaming startups were the direct beneficiaries.Of these sectors, edtech is still the easiest word to land a term sheet from an investor. Edtech startups have raised a record $1.8 billion in capital this year, according to data from Venture Intelligence.Of this, online learning firm Byju’s alone has raised a billion dollars, most recently a $500 million in a round led by technology-focused fund Silver Lake, valuing it at $10.8 billionThis is out of the $2.9 billion all startups combined have raised this year, including software startup Postman, food-delivery firm Zomato and fitness startup Cure.fitNot everyone gainsEven as the funding environment becomes positive, not every startup will gain equally. Market leaders, companies in new sectors, and those backed by top tier investors will see funding gravitate towards them.“Investor sentiment is strong now, and capital is more cheaply available than ever before for both public and private markets. However, we see more capital gravitating towards leaders with strong momentum,” says Karan Sharma, co-head and executive director of technology investment banking at Avendus.“Globally, both public markets and private markets have recovered in the last few months. Foreign funds, which sometimes drive large cheques and valuations, are also back,” he added.India exposure of foreign funds increasingIndian startups have been reliant on foreign capital, and many investors who don't have an India office fly in and fly out to cut cheques. At the height of lockdown, many thought these investors would be the last to return, given that India is often less significant for a global hedge fund during a global pandemic.“Some people feared that foreign funds may not return after the pandemic, but everyone's India exposure is increasing. We are seeing increased interest from investors that had limited or low exposure to India, pre-COVID,” Sharma says.Aside from consumer internet, business-to-business and software startups have also seen a speedy recovery in some cases. “B2B and SaaS have actually held up pretty well. I thought business and recovery would be slow, but for many startups, both existing and new clients are coming in, payment cycles are on schedule and people are closing sales effectively on Zoom,” Doshi said.However, despite a significantly better sentiment compared to April, investors still advise portfolio companies to be cautious, because even before the pandemic, private technology companies were seeing the end of a historic period of exuberance, marked by Uber’s disappointing IPO and WeWork’s IPO debacle.Further, India-specific issues, including a record 24 percent fall in GDP and unemployment concerns remain.“One should always be cautious about the medium- to long-term impact around GDP shrinkage, unemployment situation and the devastating impact on certain industries. That shall only unfold over the next few quarters,” Sharma said.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/startup/excitement-is-back-in-startup-world-as-venture-capitalists-return-5815421.html,Funding,"This is an opportunity window for the market leaders in these recovery segments to leap forward much faster than they expected,” says Pranav Pai, founding partner at 3one4 Capital, an early-stage fund.The worst is overWhen the pandemic hit India, investors hit the panic button- pulling out of nearly-done deals, postponing their own fundraising, having tough discussions on layoffs with no revenue for the foreseeable future, and bracing for smaller companies to shut down or sell out.Now, even other legacy sectors, ones hit by the pandemic and benefiting from it but not restricted to food-delivery, logistics, online content, software-as-a-service (Saas) and consumer brands, are also benefiting.“Signals show that the early excitement is returning.I thought business and recovery would be slow, but for many startups, both existing and new clients are coming in, payment cycles are on schedule and people are closing sales effectively on Zoom,” Doshi said.However, despite a significantly better sentiment compared to April, investors still advise portfolio companies to be cautious, because even before the pandemic, private technology companies were seeing the end of a historic period of exuberance, marked by Uber’s disappointing IPO and WeWork’s IPO debacle.Further, India-specific issues, including a record 24 percent fall in GDP and unemployment concerns remain.“One should always be cautious about the medium- to long-term impact around GDP shrinkage, unemployment situation and the devastating impact on certain industries.","['3one4 Capital', 'Zoom', 'IPO', 'WeWork', 'IPO']","['a record $1.8 billion', 'a billion dollars', '$500 million', '10.8', '$2.9 billion']"
3one4 Capital to raise $100 million third VC fund,03 September,"Early-stage venture fund 3one4 Capital September 2 said it is raising its third and largest fund so far worth $100 million to invest in technology-led startups.The fund is managed by Pranav Pai and Siddharth Pai, sons of former Infosys senior executive TV Mohandas Pai.3one4 has already raised about 40 percent of the fund, marking its first close - which allows it to start deploying the money, while still raising the rest of the fund. About 30-40 percent of the fund will have new investors- limited partners, while the rest will be from existing LPs.“A bigger fund gives us the option to be more flexible with cheque sizes, support companies longer, and look at new sectors,” said Pranav Pai, founding partner, 3one4, on a call with Moneycontrol.It aims to close this fund in the next 12-18 months.3one4’s current portfolio includes meat delivery startup Licious, social media app Mitron, software startup Darwinbox, neobanks Jupiter and Open, and Yulu Bikes among others.3one4 has been able to raise a new fund during the coronavirus pandemic because many of its portfolio companies- mainly online services, have benefitted the companies by boosting digital consumption.The fund’s backers include Emory Investment Management, a large US endowment that manages the assets of Emory University, Emory Healthcare and The Carter Center; Sojitz - a leading Japanese corporation, Catamaran Ventures- former Infosys CEO Narayana Murthy’s private investment arm, and Infina - a private investment company owned by the Kotak family, besides other Indian institutions and family offices.3one4 raised its debut fund of Rs 100 crore in 2016, followed by a Rs 250 crore second fund in 2017. Last year, it also raised a Rs 400 crore opportunity fund- meant to back the best performing portfolio companies, and not new deals.Like most VCs who raise successively larger funds, this lends to a strategy of picking fewer companies than before, but writing larger cheques.From the new fund, 3one4 also wants to invest in agri-tech and health startups- both sectors where it has not been very active before.“We have been a little slow with agri, but the last few years we have consistently seen a few decently sized companies get created. On healthcare, we have been especially cautious because it is more regulated, and because lives are at stake, so it needs additional caution. But we think this sector is coming of age,” Pai said.3one4’s fundraise also indicates a relatively positive investing environment, after the initial months of doom and gloom for the startup ecosystem- which was handed a harsh reality check by the pandemic, leading to layoffs, deals called off, and sharp falls in revenue.Since then, Sequoia India has closed $1.35 billion in funds to be deployed in the next two years, while Lightspeed India has also raised a $275 million fund, its third and largest so far- indicating better sentiment.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/3one4-capital-to-raise-100-million-third-vc-fund-5788321.html,Funding,"About 30-40 percent of the fund will have new investors- limited partners, while the rest will be from existing LPs.“A bigger fund gives us the option to be more flexible with cheque sizes, support companies longer, and look at new sectors,” said Pranav Pai, founding partner, 3one4, on a call with Moneycontrol.It aims to close this fund in the next 12-18 months.3one4’s current portfolio includes meat delivery startup Licious, social media app Mitron, software startup Darwinbox, neobanks Jupiter and Open, and Yulu Bikes among others.3one4 has been able to raise a new fund during the coronavirus pandemic because many of its portfolio companies- mainly online services, have benefitted the companies by boosting digital consumption.The fund’s backers include Emory Investment Management, a large US endowment that manages the assets of Emory University, Emory Healthcare and The Carter Center; Sojitz - a leading Japanese corporation, Catamaran Ventures- former Infosys CEO Narayana Murthy’s private investment arm, and Infina - a private investment company owned by the Kotak family, besides other Indian institutions and family offices.3one4 raised its debut fund of Rs 100 crore in 2016, followed by a Rs 250 crore second fund in 2017.Last year, it also raised a Rs 400 crore opportunity fund- meant to back the best performing portfolio companies, and not new deals.Like most VCs who raise successively larger funds, this lends to a strategy of picking fewer companies than before, but writing larger cheques.From the new fund, 3one4 also wants to invest in agri-tech and health startups- both sectors where it has not been very active before.“We have been a little slow with agri, but the last few years we have consistently seen a few decently sized companies get created.","['Moneycontrol', 'Mitron', 'Yulu Bikes', 'Emory Investment Management', 'Emory University', 'Emory Healthcare', 'The Carter Center', 'Sojitz', 'Infosys']","['$100 million', '$1.35 billion', '$275 million']"
"Exclusive | Dailyhunt seeks $1.2 billion valuation, unicorn tag in fundraise",07 September,"Regional language news and content aggregator Dailyhunt is in talks to raise about $100 million, seeking a valuation of $1.2 billion as it looks to cash in on the big jump in online content consumption following the coronavirus outbreak, sources said.The round is likely to be led by existing investor US-based Falcon Edge Capital that recently raised $300-million India-focused fund, sources said. The deal could make the Bengaluru-based company India’s newest unicorn, a privately held firm valued at a billion dollars or more.“The deal has not closed yet, but it should get done given their traction and because no one has been able to compete with them at the same scale. The valuation, however, is a bit aggressive,” said a person close to the talks on condition of anonymity.Dailyhunt was valued at $625 million when it raised $36 million from James Murdoch’s Lupa India in May, Entrackr reported.Dailyhunt did not respond to Moneycontrol’s email while Falcon Edge declined to comment.Run by Verse Innovation Pvt. Ltd, Dailyhunt aggregates content from newspapers and websites and is available in 13 languages, including Marathi, Gujarati, Tamil and Bhojpuri.It also offers original video content in Hindi and Telugu and a free live television streaming service in nine languages through strategic partnerships.One of the earliest entrants in the regional content aggregation space, Dailyhunt, previously known as Newshunt, was founded by ex-Nokia employees Umesh Kulkarni and Chandrashekhar Sohoni in 2009.Three years later, Virendra Gupta acquired the company and is now the chief executive. Former Facebook India head, Umang Bedi, joined the news aggregator in February 2018.Dailyhunt has been looking to raise a large round of funding for more than a year now. In the last couple of years, it raised between $20-50 million from Goldman Sachs, Sofina, Lupa India and Stonebridge Capital.Like most content startups, Dailyhunt makes money by serving ads, a business model largely seen as unsustainable because the online advertising market is cornered by Google and Facebook, whose personalisation algorithms are generally better.Dailyhunt users can create an account and select their preferred news outlets that helps in personalising their feeds, similar to China’s TikTok, Douyin and Toutiao, which is China’s largest online news aggregator. It has a “For You” section on its app, a design choice similar to the Chinese apps.As India-China ties plunge to their lowest in 50 years and Chinese investments face increased scrutiny, banned TikTok’s parent ByteDance is a minority shareholder in Dailyhunt, where it led a $25 million round in 2016.TikTok and 58 other Chinese apps were banned by India a few days after 20 Indian soldiers were killed in a clash with the troops of the neighbouring country in Ladakh’s Galwan Valley on June 14.Indian content startups, in news or social media space, have found monetisation challenging, though sources say Dailyhunt has a revenue of about $50 million, an exception in the space.Regional language platforms such as ShareChat and Pratilipi, have, so far, not been able to monetise beyond a few million dollars despite a sizable user base.Another news aggregator, InShorts, backed by Tiger Global Management, also wants to make a dent in the space.“Dailyhunt and others with regional content as a focus have a non-English speaking, non-metro core audience, whose purchasing power is relatively low. It is a segment online advertisers have been wary of so far because it is difficult to make money from these users,” said an investor in the space, requesting anonymity.Dailyhunt, however, stands to gain in the long run from the pandemic, which has dealt a big blow to revenues of the already struggling newspaper industry and driven up digital news consumption.In the initial months of the pandemic, lower ad spends online hit digital media platforms but in the long term, they stand to benefit.Dailyhunt has also faced headwinds on the regulatory front.

"EXCLUSIVE | SAIF Partners in talks to back Country Delight at Rs 1,000 crore valuation",20 August,"SAIF Partners, one of India’s leading venture capital firms, is in advanced talks to lead a Rs 100-crore round in direct-to-consumer milk startup Country Delight, sources have told Moneycontrol.The round will value Country Delight at Rs 1,000 crore, up from the Rs 600 crore it was valued at in February 2019. Existing investors Matrix Partners and Orios Venture Partners are expected to participate in the round as well.“They are growing well, and the unit economics are good so far, so it is a sustainable model, although in a premium category, where their price points are relatively high,” said a person close to the company, requesting anonymity.SAIF Partners and Country Delight did not respond to Moneycontrol’s emails seeking comment.Founded in 2013 by Chakradhar Gade and Nitin Kaushal, Country Delight runs a full-stack subscription model. It has cow farms and it also pasteurises, tests and delivers milk, eliminating the middleman.The Delhi-NCR-based, which delivers in Pune, Mumbai, NCR and Bengaluru, has a revenue of about Rs 30 crore and an EBITDA of Rs 3 crore per month, indicating it is close to profitability. EBITDA is earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization.Country Delight is also the only venture-backed player in the D2C milk brand market. Other startups such as DailyNinja and Milkbasket focus only on delivery of milk and dairy items, and aggregate them from various stores—not manufacture themselves.The micro-delivery model—to deliver a few items regularly— has not proven to be sustainable, so far, as these startups have been exploring acquisitions by larger companies to survive.Grocery delivery firm BigBasket acquired DailyNinja in March this year and Milkbasket is learnt to be in talks with possible buyers.Country Delight competes with Parag Milk Foods Ltd, a listed stock whose brand Pride of Cows runs a similar premium subscription-based delivery model.For the quarter ended March 31, 2020, Parag Milk Foods reported a net profit of Rs 8.5 crore, on an operating income of Rs 524 crore, less than Rs 26.8 crore profit on an income of Rs 623 crore for the December 2019 quarter.Country Delight last raised $10 million in February 2019 led by Matrix. It has also raised debt from Alteria Capital, a venture debt firm.Incoming investor SAIF has been active in the consumer and online brands segment.

"EXCLUSIVE | Coronavirus a minor irritant, funds continue to flow for fintechs in 2020: Report",14 August,"Indian financial technology firms raised $1.3 billion through 91 deals in the first half of 2020 compared to $2.6 billion in all of 2019, a report has said.Half-yearly trends show that even with the coronavirus outbreak disrupting business plans, funds have continued to flow for fintechs, which include startups leveraging technology to offer lending, payments and other financial services, though at a slower pace.And, if the trend holds, this year could end up being better than 2019, which saw ​ 73 deals amounting to $831 million in the first six months.The report Indian Fintechs vs The Crisis, An Overview of Investment Trends was shared by The Fintech Meetup exclusively with Moneycontrol.The Fintech Meetup was started by a former top executive of Visa Abhishant Pant to bring fintech startups together. It runs three programmes The Fintech Yatra, a fintech masterclass to help budding entrepreneurs and an angel network for the early-stage fund.COVID-19 VaccineFrequently Asked QuestionsA vaccine works by mimicking a natural infection. A vaccine not only induces immune response to protect people from any future COVID-19 infection, but also helps quickly build herd immunity to put an end to the pandemic. Herd immunity occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population becomes immune to a disease, making the spread of disease from person to person unlikely. The good news is that SARS-CoV-2 virus has been fairly stable, which increases the viability of a vaccine.There are broadly four types of vaccine — one, a vaccine based on the whole virus (this could be either inactivated, or an attenuated [weakened] virus vaccine); two, a non-replicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of SARS-CoV; three, nucleic-acid vaccines that have genetic material like DNA and RNA of antigens like spike protein given to a person, helping  human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine; and four, protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombinant proteins of SARS-COV-2 along with an adjuvant (booster) is given as a vaccine.Vaccine development is a long, complex process. Unlike drugs that are given to people with a diseased, vaccines are given to healthy people and also vulnerable sections such as children, pregnant women and the elderly. So rigorous tests are compulsory. History says that the fastest time it took to develop a vaccine is five years, but it usually takes double or sometimes triple that time.Lending leads the packLending startups grabbed the largest share of deals, with $814 million funding followed by $240 million for payments firms.The largest funding round happened in Sachin Bansal-promoted Navi, which got a $400 million in 2020.Insurance startup Digit with $84 million was next, followed by BharatPe, a digital payments player for small merchants, which got $75 million funding.The report relies on publicly disclosed investment figures and corporate filings for the first six months of 2020. Most of these deals were announced after the viral outbreak in the country but could have been stitched at the beginning of the year.India reported its first coronavirus case on January 30 and after a lull of more than a month, reports of sporadic infections started coming in and on March 24 a nationwide lockdown was announced to curb the spread of the disease.Among the cities, Bengaluru continues to be the startup destination, with 31 fintechs based in the city getting funded compared to Mumbai getting 22 deals and Gurugram 11.The year 2020 seems to be going better not only in terms of the number of deals but also funding value that has gone up 57 percent over last year.The report says financial inclusion space has the potential to attract more investments and early signs point to that. Companies in the financial inclusion space received $19 million in 2020 compared to only $4 million in 2019.Deal-making trends There was a considerable uptick in deals of up to $5 million and beyond $20 million.Investments in the range of $10-20 million saw a 33 percent decline compared to last year. Above $50 million deals grew to seven this year against five during the same period last year.Two big bang rounds in the $100 million-plus category were driven by Navi Technologies, which received funding from angels and its founders, and PhonePe that is backed by its parent entity, Flipkart.At a time when B2B startups are being hailed as revenue-generating businesses, the report found that 60 percent of the deals were cornered by consumer-facing startups. A total of $948 million was pumped into this space, the report says.The figures were skewed by the mega funding round of Navi. Without the $400-million deal, the second quarter funding would have fallen 13 percent compared to last year, the report says.“Setting Navi aside, investments are still at par with a slight increase…given the instability brought on by COVID, I'd say the discount on funding growth is a given. So it seems like a resilient indicator that deal flow has not fallen below last H1's funding,” said Pant, founder, The Fintech Meetup. Pant is an angel investor himself.Coinvesting is another theme that pops out, given the pandemic and the uncertainties around the economic slowdown, deal makers looked for more participants for the big rounds.Agro-finance startup Bijak, for instance, saw the participation of eight co-investors in its $11.8-million round. Gold loan startup Rupeek saw six investors together pumping in $60 million its Series C round.VCs still optimisticFintech continues to be on the radar of large investors. Rajat Agarwal, director at Matrix Partners India, said the next decade will start with some pain but eventually see massive value creation.“Sceptics should track HDFC Bank and Bajaj Finance’s stock price post the 2008 crisis, or note that companies such as Square, Stripe and Sofi started in 2009, 2010 and 2011, respectively,” he said.Players like Square and Stripe are few of the most successful fintech startups coming out of Silicon Valley.Matrix Partners has funded companies like Mswipe, Razorpay, Avail Finance, Ofbusiness, Jupiter and others.The COVID impactThe April-June quarter saw a 22 percent dip in venture funding, the report says, highlighting a cautious approach adopted by VCs after the pandemic spread in India.Funding moved into the Series A category companies, which needed money to boost operations. Early-stage funding slowed down. Series D and E rounds also saw a marginal increase, showing investor preference for well-established players.As per data brought together by the report, January saw deals worth $242 million, February $ 212 million and it fell to $129 million in March and $38 million in June. April saw a jump to $547 million but that was primarily because of the Navi’s $400-million announcement.“The initial months of H2 2020 will likely see a slow down as indicated by the low waters of June. Hopefully, Q4 can be better, now startups are included under priority sector lending so that can be the saving grace of many early-stage startups,” said Pant.​",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/startup/exclusive-coronavirus-a-minor-irritant-funds-continue-to-flow-for-fintechs-in-2020-report-5702811.html,Funding,"The good news is that SARS-CoV-2 virus has been fairly stable, which increases the viability of a vaccine.There are broadly four types of vaccine — one, a vaccine based on the whole virus (this could be either inactivated, or an attenuated [weakened] virus vaccine); two, a non-replicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of SARS-CoV; three, nucleic-acid vaccines that have genetic material like DNA and RNA of antigens like spike protein given to a person, helping  human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine; and four, protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombinant proteins of SARS-COV-2 along with an adjuvant (booster) is given as a vaccine.Vaccine development is a long, complex process.Most of these deals were announced after the viral outbreak in the country but could have been stitched at the beginning of the year.India reported its first coronavirus case on January 30 and after a lull of more than a month, reports of sporadic infections started coming in and on March 24 a nationwide lockdown was announced to curb the spread of the disease.Among the cities, Bengaluru continues to be the startup destination, with 31 fintechs based in the city getting funded compared to Mumbai getting 22 deals and Gurugram 11.The year 2020 seems to be going better not only in terms of the number of deals but also funding value that has gone up 57 percent over last year.The report says financial inclusion space has the potential to attract more investments and early signs point to that.","['RNA', 'Gurugram']","['$1.3 billion', '$2.6 billion', '$831 million', '$814 million', '$240 million', '$400 million', '$84 million', '$75 million', '$19 million', 'only $4 million', 'up to $5 million', '$20 million', '$10-20 million', 'Above $50 million', '$100 million', '$948 million', '$400-million', '$11.8-million', '$60 million', '$242 million', '$ 212 million', '$129 million', '$38 million', '$547 million', '$400-million']"

India-China border tensions could choke funds for electric vehicle startups: Report,10 July,"Indian startups, especially in the electric vehicles (EVs) space, are reportedly looking at tough times ahead after border tensions between neighbour India and China escalated.The sector is highly dependent on Chinese imports and may find it increasingly difficult to draw funds from private equity players and venture capital funds in light of the recent event, sources told Mint.“PE and VC investors have in the last few months become apprehensive of startups that have substantial exposure to China.

Due diligence important for residential real estate projects post COVID-19,29 May,"Kuldeep Tikkha  |  Prashant VedThe real estate sector in India had been facing significant headwinds much before the COVID-19 crisis struck. The sector suffered from a lack of availability of funding from banks, NBFCs and HFCs. Besides, certain structural changes implemented by the government in the recent past, such as demonetisation and introduction of GST, had also adversely impacted the demand for residential real estate and led to built-up unsold inventories with developers.With favourable initiatives undertaken by the government with a view to bringing transparency in the sector, reduction in GST rates for new projects, and lowering of lending rates, the calendar year 2020 was expected to herald a recovery in the real estate sector in India. However, the COVID-19 pandemic and its economic fallout would now delay the recovery in residential real estate.Most of the residential real estate projects in India have been historically funded by banks and NBFCs. However, with funds from NBFCs drying up, the capital required for completing under-construction projects is likely to come from real estate funds and Alternative Investment Funds (AIF) willing to provide last mile funding against the security of project cash flows on a priority basis. The government has already committed to providing debt funding for completing stuck projects through setting up of a dedicated AIF in the form of SWAMIH.The prices of real estate have been under pressure since 2014 due to lower demand. There is a significant pile-up of unsold real estate units with developers. In a recent webinar discussion organized by National Real Estate Development Council (Naredco), Deepak Parekh, chairman of HDFC had advised the developers to reduce the prices of real estate units to accelerate the liquidation of unsold inventories. This would significantly impact the value of unsold inventories held by the developers.COVID-19 VaccineFrequently Asked QuestionsA vaccine works by mimicking a natural infection. A vaccine not only induces immune response to protect people from any future COVID-19 infection, but also helps quickly build herd immunity to put an end to the pandemic. Herd immunity occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population becomes immune to a disease, making the spread of disease from person to person unlikely. The good news is that SARS-CoV-2 virus has been fairly stable, which increases the viability of a vaccine.There are broadly four types of vaccine — one, a vaccine based on the whole virus (this could be either inactivated, or an attenuated [weakened] virus vaccine); two, a non-replicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of SARS-CoV; three, nucleic-acid vaccines that have genetic material like DNA and RNA of antigens like spike protein given to a person, helping  human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine; and four, protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombinant proteins of SARS-COV-2 along with an adjuvant (booster) is given as a vaccine.Vaccine development is a long, complex process. Unlike drugs that are given to people with a diseased, vaccines are given to healthy people and also vulnerable sections such as children, pregnant women and the elderly. So rigorous tests are compulsory. History says that the fastest time it took to develop a vaccine is five years, but it usually takes double or sometimes triple that time.Further, after COVID-19, the recovery in demand for affordable housing is expected to be faster compared to other segments given the economic conditions of buyers.Given the expected adverse impact on sales and cash flows in under development projects, it will be important for funding agencies to factor the impact of COVID-19 in their evaluation of the project. Here are some areas that need to be adequately covered as part of due diligence on under development residential real estate projects.A stress test on sold receivablesSold receivable from a project represents balance cash inflows from sold inventory. Sold receivable for a project would include a) amounts which are demanded against completed milestones but not yet paid by customers (Amount due) and b) amounts to be demanded in future on completion of future milestones (Amount not due). Value of sold receivable is one of the key securities for loans granted to a developer.Diligence procedures on such sold receivables should involve understanding the proportion of such sold receivables (both due and not due) from sales which are not backed by a registered agreement of sale. While such unregistered sales were always subject to the risk of potential cancellations in the past (and thereby, reduction in the corresponding value of sold receivable), the probability of customers opting for cancellations due to COVID-19 would significantly increase.The risk of such cancellations is very high in case of unregistered sales where the customers have only paid nominal advances (5-10% of Agreement value). Besides, registered agreement for sales is also subject to the risk of cancellations especially in markets where stamp duty and registration costs are not significant.A comparison of customer equity in the project (i.e. the amount paid by the customer including stamp duty) with loss due to decline in the market value of the unit may provide an indication of units which may be subject to the risk of cancellation.Funding agencies would also have to understand the contractual rights of developers towards cancellation penalties under the agreement for sale with customers.Value of sold receivables from a project may also be impacted on account of any subsequent discounts being offered to customers by the developer with a view to either pre-pone the timelines for recovery of the remaining balance or for customer retention.In certain instances, customers may request for deferral of timelines for milestone linked to the installments due to the economic condition of the customer. This may lead to deferment of collections towards completion of the project instead of construction linked milestone payment.To summarise, diligence procedures on sold receivables should include customer analysis of sold receivables to assess the risk of potential cancellations. They should appropriately factor any discounts/deferral of collections agreed with customers. Analysis of such receivables should also factor the economic condition of the customer and proposed manner of funding (bank funded or self-funded) to gain further comfort on the collectability of sold receivable.Value of unsold inventoriesThe level of unsold inventories with real estate developers was already higher prior to COVID-19. COVID-19 would further lead to a dent in customer demand. Oversupply of inventory without adequate demand may lead to a reduction in selling prices for these units. This would impact the underlying value of the collateral being offered to the funding agency. Besides, the timeline for liquidation of such unsold inventories would be further elongated amid tepid demand.While diligence procedures by funding agencies should include detailed analysis around average selling prices and sales velocity across different units, historical trends in average sales rates and velocities may not be indicative of selling prices and velocities in the future. Funding agencies would have to build appropriate sensitivities around sales prices and velocity for liquidation of unsold inventories while estimating future cash flows.COVID-19 would also lead to reductions in instances of walk-in purchases and would require developers to re-engineer selling and marketing plans. This would include, among other things, digitization of the sales process, which may lead to additional investments.Vendor claimsVendor payments may be stretched and there may be claims from vendors for losses due to idle time. Disputes with vendors would further impact construction progress thereby impacting the overall project completion timelines.A proper assessment of vendor liabilities and claims should be done as part of diligence. Diligence procedures should include a reading of vendor contracts to understand the commercial terms agreed, including the right to such idle time claims.Developers may also enter into barter arrangements with vendors where vendor liabilities are settled against handover of units in the project. Such arrangements, if not appropriately documented and disclosed during diligence, would impact the value of unsold inventory being underwritten. Detailed analysis of vendor liabilities and settlements would therefore, become all the more important. Confirmations from developers may be obtained to ensure that all such unusual arrangements are disclosed.Customer claimsCOVID-19 would impact construction and project completion timelines. The period of such delays may vary across developers and projects and may even extend beyond timelines committed under RERA, at times. Diligence procedures should include a careful reading of Agreement for Sale entered with customers to understand the committed timelines, force Majeure clauses and customers’ right to interest claim and cancellation for delays.Further, the agreements registered prior to the implementation of RERA in case of units sold in Maharashtra would continue to be governed by erstwhile Maharashtra Ownership of Flats Act (MOFA). The timelines for the handover of units in such cases and the corresponding interest obligation for delays would therefore, be governed by clauses of MOFA.Potential interest payable to customers for delays in hand over of units should be appropriately factored as part of cash outflows.Developers’ obligation under the subvention scheme may also be impacted on account of delays in completion of the Project due to COVID-19. This may lead to an increase in subvention cost for the developer in cases where the tripartite agreement specifies that the developer would bear the interest up to the date of actual handover of a unit to the customer.The estimated cost to completeThe estimated cost to be incurred to complete under-construction projects may undergo a change following a delay in project completion and on account of increase in labour cost, change in construction norms (social distancing, sanitization of sites) and changes in prices of steel/cement. Thorough technical diligence would have to be done to assess the revised estimates of balance cost which should be appropriately factored.Appropriate assessment of the funding gap Considering some of the matters discussed above, COVID-19 would severely impact the sources of cash flows in real estate projects with delays in customer collections due to the economic impact of COVID-19 and unwillingness of banks and NBFCs to provide further funding.The shortfall in cash inflows would have a corresponding impact on a developer’s ability to meet its obligation towards monthly/quarterly repayments to lenders and payment of dues to construction vendors. This would lead to mismatches in monthly cash inflows and outflows, thereby leaving a funding gap. The funding gap, if not addressed through moratorium from lenders or alternate means of cash inflow, would lead to delays/default under lender agreements.As part of diligence, an investor should obtain and analyse the mapping of projected monthly cash inflows and outflows to understand funding gaps. This would help the investor obtain a better assessment of overall fund requirements and timelines for the same.Terms of lender agreements should be read to understand the status of historical compliances with loan covenants, securities given, and other terms. Diligence should include understanding the level of debt not just at the project level but also at a group level.Cross default clauses in lender agreements may have to be appropriately evaluated and addressed. Besides, conditions attached to any loan moratorium availed and its impact (including any restrictions) on the utilisation of future cash flows would have to be evaluated.SummaryWe believe that funding agencies and banks would have to do robust diligence across financial, legal, technical and commercial aspects of a project to make an appropriate risk assessment of factors affecting the project due to COVID-19.

WHO creates foundation to tap new funding sources,27 May,"World Health Organisation Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus announced on Wednesday the creation of a foundation that will enable it to tap new sources of funding, including the general public.The WHO Foundation is being created as an independent grant-making entity that will support the organisation's efforts to address the most pressing global health challenges by raising new funding from ""non-traditional sources"".The United States suspended funding to the WHO this year after President Donald Trump complained about its handling of the coronavirus pandemic and accused it of being ""China-centric"".Trump also threatened this month to halt funding from the body's top donor altogether if it does not commit to reforms within 30 days.But Tedros said the creation of the WHO Foundation had nothing to do with ""recent funding issues.""COVID-19 VaccineFrequently Asked QuestionsA vaccine works by mimicking a natural infection. A vaccine not only induces immune response to protect people from any future COVID-19 infection, but also helps quickly build herd immunity to put an end to the pandemic. Herd immunity occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population becomes immune to a disease, making the spread of disease from person to person unlikely. The good news is that SARS-CoV-2 virus has been fairly stable, which increases the viability of a vaccine.There are broadly four types of vaccine — one, a vaccine based on the whole virus (this could be either inactivated, or an attenuated [weakened] virus vaccine); two, a non-replicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of SARS-CoV; three, nucleic-acid vaccines that have genetic material like DNA and RNA of antigens like spike protein given to a person, helping  human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine; and four, protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombinant proteins of SARS-COV-2 along with an adjuvant (booster) is given as a vaccine.Vaccine development is a long, complex process.

Covid-19 | VCs on the prowl for a good startup hunt in virus storm ,12 May,"Much against the conventional wisdom that investors claw back during rainy days, several venture capital (VC) funds are out shopping, striking deals and writing cheques even as the coronavirus outbreak continues to hurt the economy, pushing businesses to the brink. Surplus capital, soft valuation of startups, a shift towards tech in a post-coronavirus world and family offices looking to diversify asset base in times of economic uncertainty are some of the reasons for the ongoing funding activity.Take the example of online vernacular competitive test preparation startup Pariksha. The company signed term sheets, a non-binding document that spells out the broader contours of the arrangement, with investors for an extension of its pre-Series A round at the beginning of March.On March 24 when Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced a lockdown on national television, the founders got jittery. Some of the promised money was in the bank but the rest was yet to come. While they were trying to figure out the impact of the announcement on their funding, some of the investors called, one of the founders, Karanvir Singh, told Moneycontrol.COVID-19 VaccineFrequently Asked QuestionsA vaccine works by mimicking a natural infection.

The rest of the money would be transferred soon, he assured Singh.“In less than a week, the entire sum was in the bank,” Singh said, without disclosing the amount. Over a dozen investors, including INSEAD Angels, IIT Kanpur Angels, Nikhil Vora and Swati Mehra from Sixth Sense Ventures, besides Bhatia and existing investor Venture Catalysts, concluded the deal.For live updates on coronavirus, click hereFounded in 2105 by Singh, Utkarsh Bagri, Vikram Shekhawat and Deepak Choudhary, Pune-based Pariksha says it helps 13.6 crore people in small towns and villages prepare for state government job exams every year.With governments increasingly shifting such tests online, more and more job-seeking youngsters want to familiarise themselves with the medium as well as tech without leaving their homes. Investors, too, sensed a growth opportunity--online preparation will not only be helpful during the lockdown but also after that, when social distancing will be the norm, at least for some time.Singh's venture is not the only one to have received venture capital funding. Dozens of startups across sectors such as health, fintech, gaming and education have received funds in the last couple of months while several unicorns face uncertainty. Over $120 million worth of deals were struck across 48 rounds across consumer, fin-tech and ed-tech space in April alone, startups data tracker Tracxn said. The data is for companies that are not older than five years.""Everyone understands that a down phase is the best time to invest in any asset class. Historically, we have seen most of the unicorns come up during these times whether it was the 2008-09 crisis or 2001-02 bubble bust. Cases in the example are companies like Uber, Policybazaar, Airbnb and Whatsapp,"" said Anuj Golecha, founder of domestic startup incubator and early-stage investor Venture Catalysts.Online financial services portal Policybazaar, founded in June 2008, became a unicorn, or was valued at $1 billion, ten years later. The company is among the few tech-firms currently disrupting the dominance created by state-owned or even private insurance firms.Venture Catalysts itself claims to have invested in at least three startups–Qin1, which conducts online classes for children, and health supplement firm Power Gummies and Pariksha in the last one month. ""Overall in 2019, we did 69 deals. I don't see that number falling this year,"" Golecha said.The startup cushionEven family offices that have businesses across multiple verticals are trying to place their bets on startups. A fund manager who works for a leading family office with interests in the real estate sector said given the slowdown in his core business, the owner was looking to diversify into startups. “A lot of business houses are struggling. Startups are a new kind of avenue for many of them, especially across the COVID-positive segments such as healthcare, education and financial solutions in the mid to growth stages,” he said, requesting anonymity.There is a fair amount of money to be deployed, with multiple venture capital funds having closed their funds in the last one year.According to VCC Edge, India-focussed private equity and venture capital funds raised $11.7 billion just in 2019.These include funds such as Accel Partners, which raised $550 million in December, Singapore-based Vertex Venture Holdings that got $230 million for technology startups in Southeast Asia and India and domestic venture capital fund Blume Ventures, which closed its opportunity fund at $41 million earlier this year.“There is a fair amount of capital waiting to be deployed. Some investors are aggressively scouting for deals, some are in the wait-and-watch mode. But everyone is evaluating something or the other. There couldn’t be a better time to enter with such realistic valuations,” said Pankaj Karna, managing director of boutique investment banking platform Maple Capital Advisors.However, investors are being careful as restrictions on movement are coming in the way of due diligence. They are now relying on virtual data rooms and mostly reference checks to close deals.“It is not that everyone is getting funded. Investors are smart enough to recognise startups that are resilient, agile and adaptive. Silicon Valley calls them camels. They will be able to weather the storm and when the tide turns, they can grow very fast,” said Nimesh Kampani, president, LetsVenture Plus, a growth platform launched by deals syndication platform LetsVenture.Launched in early May, LetsVenture Plus will allow ultra-high net individuals and family offices to invest in growth-stage startups. So far, LetsVenture has focussed on early-stage deals and claims to have closed 14 such agreements since March.“Even for the growth stage, a good amount of investor interest has already started to pour in for businesses with a moat. People want to diversify their asset base, both across different classes and geographies,” said Kampani.Singh, who just closed the funding round for Pariksha, vouched for it. He has got plenty of investor queries for the growth round. “Every investor who does not have ed-tech in its portfolio is currently looking to make an investment in this sector,” he said.Some investors are, however, sticking to internal rounds. Bertelsmann India Investments, which counts hospitality firm Treebo, music-streaming company Saavn and online lending platform Lendingkart among its portfolio companies, is keeping the powder dry for its existing companies.“It is a well-known fact that the market has become skewed and investments will only flow towards a specific direction. In such a scenario, we have to look for the well-being of our own companies first,” Bertelsmann India Investments managing director Pankaj Makkar said.He, however, declined to comment if the company had made any internal investments in the last couple of months.There are also instances where rounds are taking longer to conclude but investors say they are happening nonetheless. “All in all, investors have realised that it is a buyers’ market and there is cautious optimism. Valuations have softened and even the startups realise that money in the bank is much better right now given the uncertainty around,” said Anup Jain, managing partner at Orios Venture Partners.The recent $8 billion funding for RIL’s Jio Platforms from social media giant Facebook and private equity firms Silver Lake and Vista Equity Partners has helped boost the confidence of investors.As India faces its worst medical emergencies in recent times that also threatens its economy, the startup sector holds out hope for Brand India.Disclaimer: Reliance Industries Ltd., which also owns Jio, is the sole beneficiary of Independent Media Trust which controls Network18 Media & Investments Ltd.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/startup/covid-19-vcs-on-the-prowl-for-a-good-startup-hunt-in-virus-storm-5252191.html,Funding,"The good news is that SARS-CoV-2 virus has been fairly stable, which increases the viability of a vaccine.There are broadly four types of vaccine — one, a vaccine based on the whole virus (this could be either inactivated, or an attenuated [weakened] virus vaccine); two, a non-replicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of SARS-CoV; three, nucleic-acid vaccines that have genetic material like DNA and RNA of antigens like spike protein given to a person, helping  human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine; and four, protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombinant proteins of SARS-COV-2 along with an adjuvant (booster) is given as a vaccine.Vaccine development is a long, complex process.Startups are a new kind of avenue for many of them, especially across the COVID-positive segments such as healthcare, education and financial solutions in the mid to growth stages,” he said, requesting anonymity.There is a fair amount of money to be deployed, with multiple venture capital funds having closed their funds in the last one year.According to VCC Edge, India-focussed private equity and venture capital funds raised $11.7 billion just in 2019.These include funds such as Accel Partners, which raised $550 million in December, Singapore-based Vertex Venture Holdings that got $230 million for technology startups in Southeast Asia and India and domestic venture capital fund Blume Ventures, which closed its opportunity fund at $41 million earlier this year.“There is a fair amount of capital waiting to be deployed.","['RNA', 'VCC Edge', 'Accel Partners', 'Vertex Venture Holdings', 'Blume Ventures']","['$120 million', '$1 billion', '$11.7 billion', '$550 million', '$230 million', '$41 million', '$8 billion']"

A vaccine not only induces immune response to protect people from any future COVID-19 infection, but also helps quickly build herd immunity to put an end to the pandemic. Herd immunity occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population becomes immune to a disease, making the spread of disease from person to person unlikely. The good news is that SARS-CoV-2 virus has been fairly stable, which increases the viability of a vaccine.There are broadly four types of vaccine — one, a vaccine based on the whole virus (this could be either inactivated, or an attenuated [weakened] virus vaccine); two, a non-replicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of SARS-CoV; three, nucleic-acid vaccines that have genetic material like DNA and RNA of antigens like spike protein given to a person, helping  human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine; and four, protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombinant proteins of SARS-COV-2 along with an adjuvant (booster) is given as a vaccine.Vaccine development is a long, complex process. Unlike drugs that are given to people with a diseased, vaccines are given to healthy people and also vulnerable sections such as children, pregnant women and the elderly. So rigorous tests are compulsory. History says that the fastest time it took to develop a vaccine is five years, but it usually takes double or sometimes triple that time.The board approved fundraising through appropriate instruments, permitted under the applicable statute, in one or more tranches/series to the eligible investors, who are allowed to invest in or subscribe to such instruments.The company said the Management Administration and Share Transfer Committee (MAS Committee) of the board is authorized to take all necessary actions in this regard.IRB Infra had recently closed a deal of around Rs 4,400 crore with GIC Affiliates, Singapore towards investment in company's nine BOT (build, operate, transfer) assets under private InvIT (Infrastructure Investment Trust) structure.The company had bagged Rs 8,200-crore Mumbai-Pune Expressway project under TOT (toll, operate and transfer) and commissioned Goa–Kundapura BOT project, thus making all projects revenue generating, besides resuming toll operations and construction activities across India in line with the guidelines by NHAI on COVID-19.IRB Infra is one of the largest private roads and highways infrastructure developers in India having a track record of constructing over 12,600 lane km in two decades.The company has executed projects pan-India with an ability to construct over 500 km in a year.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/irb-infrastructures-board-approves-fundraising-of-up-to-rs-2500-crore-5190781.html,Funding,"IRB Infrastructure on Sunday said its board has approved raising up to Rs 2,500 crore to fund ongoing and planned Capex and for general corporate purposes in the wake of lockdown due to COVID-19 pandemic.The infrastructure company said that the funds will be raised through appropriate instruments in one or more tranches.The Board of Directors of IRB Infrastructure Developers Ltd today approved fundraising of up to Rs 2,500 crore to meet ongoing and planned CAPEX requirements and cash flow mismatches of the company as well as for general corporate purposes in wake of COVID-19, the company said in a statement.IRB Infrastructure Developers Ltd Chairman & Managing Director Virendra D Mhaiskar said, ""We plan to use these funds to meet payments to creditors, firmed up project expenses as well as the general corporate purposes, during the ongoing lockdown situation due to COVID-19.History says that the fastest time it took to develop a vaccine is five years, but it usually takes double or sometimes triple that time.The board approved fundraising through appropriate instruments, permitted under the applicable statute, in one or more tranches/series to the eligible investors, who are allowed to invest in or subscribe to such instruments.The company said the Management Administration and Share Transfer Committee (MAS Committee) of the board is authorized to take all necessary actions in this regard.IRB Infra had recently closed a deal of around Rs 4,400 crore with GIC Affiliates, Singapore towards investment in company's nine BOT (build, operate, transfer) assets under private InvIT (Infrastructure Investment Trust) structure.The company had bagged Rs 8,200-crore Mumbai-Pune Expressway project under TOT (toll, operate and transfer) and commissioned Goa–Kundapura BOT project, thus making all projects revenue generating, besides resuming toll operations and construction activities across India in line with the guidelines by NHAI on COVID-19.IRB Infra is one of the largest private roads and highways infrastructure developers in India having a track record of constructing over 12,600 lane km in two decades.The company has executed projects pan-India with an ability to construct over 500 km in a year.","['IRB Infrastructure', 'COVID-19', 'The Board of Directors', 'IRB Infrastructure Developers Ltd', 'COVID-19', 'IRB Infrastructure Developers Ltd', 'the Management Administration', 'Share Transfer Committee', 'MAS Committee', 'IRB Infra', 'GIC Affiliates', 'BOT', 'InvIT', 'Infrastructure Investment Trust', 'TOT', 'Goa–Kundapura BOT', 'COVID-19.IRB Infra', 'pan-India']",[]
"To tide over liquidity crisis, builders demand part sharing of cashflows between stress fund and lenders",24 April,"In view of the liquidity crisis being faced by the real estate sector due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, a real estate builders' body has demanded that the government allow part sharing of cashflows between the stress fund and the existing lenders.""Since the last four months only two projects have received funding from AIF amounting to no more than Rs 540 crore, a negligible fraction of the interest liability accumulating during the period. We recognize that the entire concept of AIF is premised upon the fund having priority in repayment over the existing lenders,"" Credai said in a letter addressed to the Secretary, Department of Financial Services, Ministry of Finance.""After deliberations with all stakeholders, it is requested to please allow sharing of cash flows between stress fund and existing lenders to the extent that debt servicing of the existing lenders is not in default.

The fundraising is important for the startup ecosystem as well which has been hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic.“Alpine issued the term sheet when India was just beginning the shutdown. It is certainly odd for a virtual first-time investor to come in during a time like this.

Ltd, aggregates news from newspapers and websites and caters to 13 languages, including Marathi, Gujarati, Tamil and Bhojpuri.The Bengaluru-based company also offers original video content in Hindi and Telugu and a free live television streaming service in nine languages through strategic partnerships.Dailyhunt is one of the earliest entrants in the regional content space. Previously known as Newshunt, Dailyhunt was founded by ex-Nokia employees Umesh Kulkarni and Chandrashekhar Sohoni in 2009. Three years later, Virendra Gupta acquired the company and is now the chief executive. Former Facebook India head, Umang Bedi, joined the news aggregator in February 2018.“The coronavirus has really helped Dailyhunt. They have been able to touch user numbers which they have been trying to reach for over a year now,” said another person close to the company. The lockdown was on April 14 extended to May 3.While Moneycontrol could not ascertain their monthly active users (MAU) independently, Dailyhunt’s annualised revenue is about $60-70 million, said the sources cited above. Like most mainstream content startups, Dailyhunt makes money via advertisements.However, the coronavirus outbreak has tied up advertising budgets for most companies, whose business has dried up. To survive the unprecedented crisis, small and medium companies are looking at job cuts and even shutdowns. So, even if Dailyhunt draws in record viewers in these months, it may not translate into a significant increase in revenue. Mint reported on March 21 that the pandemic may deal a Rs 5,000-crore blow to the advertising industry, with sports, movies, food and travel being among the worst hit. Boston-based Alpine Capital is investing via its Alpine Opportunity Fund, a Cayman Islands-based private equity fund.

Coronavirus impact: Funding for real estate sector likely to go up by notches as risks increase,13 April,"The cost of institutional funding for real estate projects during and post COVID-19 is likely to become expensive with financial institutions having to factor in risks of completion, construction timelines, supply chain disruption, zero absorption, not to mention the high cost of forex hedging, say transaction experts.Despite the government having reduced lending rates by 75 bps points, banks will continue to be cautious while lending to the real estate sector and NBFCs and HFCs too post the IL&FS crisis, may not be forthcoming either unless some steps are taken to encourage them to lend to the sector.The only recourse left to developers post the three-month moratorium will then perhaps be the domestic and foreign institutional funds who have all along been lending at 15-17 percent earlier and may decide to lend at 19-20 percent post COVID depending on the risks associated with the projects.The RBI moratorium for three months, say experts may resolve the cash flow issue but what will not get addressed is the issue of liquidity in the real estate sector. For those who do not know, the sector receives funding from four categories of investors – banks that includes PSU and private sector; NBFCs and HFCs or shadow bankers for real estate; domestic funds and international funds (the likes of HDFC Capital, Kotak and Goldman Sachs and KKR).“Today, deals are not happening and the overall risk has gone up on account of coronavirus. Due to COVID-19, these funds may ascribe anything between 150 bps to 200 bps premium to the price point that they were seeking earlier. If they were looking at 17-18 percent returns earlier, they would not want to look at returns of 20 percent,” says Anckur Srivasttava of GenReal Advisers.COVID-19 VaccineFrequently Asked QuestionsA vaccine works by mimicking a natural infection. A vaccine not only induces immune response to protect people from any future COVID-19 infection, but also helps quickly build herd immunity to put an end to the pandemic. Herd immunity occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population becomes immune to a disease, making the spread of disease from person to person unlikely.

Unlike drugs that are given to people with a diseased, vaccines are given to healthy people and also vulnerable sections such as children, pregnant women and the elderly. So rigorous tests are compulsory. History says that the fastest time it took to develop a vaccine is five years, but it usually takes double or sometimes triple that time.“Structured debt- pricing of capital is likely to increase going forward,” he says.The last deal to go through in these COVID-19 times was in March this year when Delhi-headquartered financier, DMI Group had raised $200 million from overseas investors by selling rupee-denominated non-convertible debentures (NCD’s) to them despite tight liquidity conditions in global and local credit markets. The company operates in the consumer lending and affordable housing segments.“Overall, institutional funds may increase lending rates by 200 bps despite the three-month RBI moratorium. That is going to be a major pain. If that happens, projects may no longer be viable. The projects may not be able to sustain the cost of debt which is over 17-18 percent. Anything above that will be unsustainable at a point when sales are not happening at all, collections are zero and revival of constructions seems uncertain,” he says.Fund managers agree that at this point in time there are no new transactions that are taking place. “At this point no one is evaluating fresh transactions. This is because real estate is a touch and feel business and in a lockdown situation, it is impossible to make site visits. This hinders a deal from taking place,” a transaction expert told Moneycontrol.Funds may invest in ‘safe’ and completed projectsThe way forward, say some experts, is that funds would prefer investing in projects that are ‘safe’, command the least risk and are at the ‘completion’ stage.“In light of increased risks during and after the COVID-19 phase, funds would prefer to invest in assets with the lowest risk, especially completed assets that have an occupation certificate and low debt. For projects meeting these benchmarks, the rate of interest could be close to what it was earlier – around 14-15 percent but for others, the rate could be as high as 20 percent. Going forward, there would be a race towards ‘safe projects’,” says another transaction expert.Demand for funding to emanate from NBFCs and HFCs. “The RBI moratorium for three months is for banks. NBFCs and HFCs still have to make all bank and MF payments on time. This would lead to the cash flows of the more leveraged institutions getting strained and they may not be in a position to deploy significant funds even if the lockdown is lifted and there is room for fresh transactions to take place,” says Amar Merani, managing director and CEO of Xander Finance.Will the cost of funding go up? Finance providers would prefer to invest in assets with the lowest risk, especially completed assets that have an occupation certificate and low group level debt. For projects meeting these benchmarks, the rate of interest could be close to what it was earlier – but for others, the rate could be higher. Going forward, there would be a race towards ‘safe deals’, he says.A real estate developer Moneycontrol spoke to said that the current scenario is extremely ‘dismal and scary.’ Tenants in malls and even office occupiers are asking for rent reduction and even complete waiver. “If we write off their rents, how will we service our debts,” he asks.“New lending may now be almost impossible now. The scenario going forward will be scary. If institutional funds start lending upwards of 20 percent, how will the projects be viable. In some cases, even sanctioned loans are not coming through,” he says.“The industry is expected to face acute problems going forward. The problem is aggravating by the hour. Coronavirus is the nail in the coffin,” he said.Another real estate developer is of the view that funding could in fact become easier to come by because PSU banks may start funding the real estate sector going forward. Having said that, the government should mandate that and create an enabling environment for the PSU banks to start funding the sector.“It can designate home loans upto Rs 70 lakh as priority sector lending and segregate the risk weightage associated with the sector. The entire sector is funded under commercial real estate. The risk associated with residential should be lowered,” he says.Having said that, the biggest tragedy that developers may face in the next six months would be that while banks would be ready to fund projects, there may not be workers at construction sites. “If I don’t get back workers in the next six months, what am I supposed to do with capital,” says the realtor.A six month delay will have an impact on the construction cycle upwards of two years, he says.In the case of the commercial segment, too, investors are analysing the risks associated with tenants moving out or for that matter multinationals wanting to renegotiate their existing contracts or decide to shrink their business in India.Current estimates of the COVID-19 impact on Indian commercial real estate indicate net office space absorption across the top seven cities will plummet by 13-30 percent in 2020 against 2019, “ says Shobhit Agarwal, MD & CEO – ANAROCK Capital.“This is because most multinationals and domestic businesses will re-strategize their expansion plans and optimize operational costs in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. All these factors will inevitably impact the Indian investment plans of US private equity majors as well.”“Investors are studying this impact. In the residential space too, with salary cuts and uncertainty associated with jobs, the propensity to consume will go down drastically, especially with regard to long term commitments,” explains another expert.Going forward, it is imperative that the government announces certain measures to relax lending norms to the sector such as reducing the risk rate for the sector or for that matter allow for refinancing in an existing project that may be stuck, says a banking expert.“There should be a temporary relaxation of these norms and restructuring of loans should be allowed,” he says.What will happen going forward?Foreign funds and for that matter even domestic funds will play an opportunistic game going forward and some experts believe that there may actually be more lenders in the market offering loans at competitive rates. Banks will be loaded with liquidity and offer low interest rates. This may propel funds to reduce their expectations.“If PSU banks do start lending at 10-11 percent for construction finance, the borrower who is borrowing at 14 percent for construction finance will get access to 10 percent. In such a scenario, funds would have to recalibrate their expectations as per the market,” says a capital markets specialist, adding they may offer funds at 13 percent in case banks offer at 11 percent and may decide to reduce their expectations.A 14 percent return for an international investor is also a ‘healthy’ return considering the rates being given in emerging and mature markets during COVID times, he says, adding the returns would definitely be better than in their home country despite the increased risks.One thing is clear though, the stress on funding is definitely going to increase, not decrease anytime sooner, at least until COVID-19 is under control.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/real-estate/coronavirus-impact-funding-for-real-estate-sector-likely-to-go-up-by-notches-as-risks-increase-5133191.html,Funding,"The cost of institutional funding for real estate projects during and post COVID-19 is likely to become expensive with financial institutions having to factor in risks of completion, construction timelines, supply chain disruption, zero absorption, not to mention the high cost of forex hedging, say transaction experts.Despite the government having reduced lending rates by 75 bps points, banks will continue to be cautious while lending to the real estate sector and NBFCs and HFCs too post the IL&FS crisis, may not be forthcoming either unless some steps are taken to encourage them to lend to the sector.The only recourse left to developers post the three-month moratorium will then perhaps be the domestic and foreign institutional funds who have all along been lending at 15-17 percent earlier and may decide to lend at 19-20 percent post COVID depending on the risks associated with the projects.The RBI moratorium for three months, say experts may resolve the cash flow issue but what will not get addressed is the issue of liquidity in the real estate sector.In the residential space too, with salary cuts and uncertainty associated with jobs, the propensity to consume will go down drastically, especially with regard to long term commitments,” explains another expert.Going forward, it is imperative that the government announces certain measures to relax lending norms to the sector such as reducing the risk rate for the sector or for that matter allow for refinancing in an existing project that may be stuck, says a banking expert.“There should be a temporary relaxation of these norms and restructuring of loans should be allowed,” he says.What will happen going forward?Foreign funds and for that matter even domestic funds will play an opportunistic game going forward and some experts believe that there may actually be more lenders in the market offering loans at competitive rates.",['RBI'],['$200 million']

Nykaa targets $1.2 billion valuation in funding round planned this year,09 March,"Beauty and fashion retailer Nykaa is eyeing a valuation of around Rs 9,000 crore ($1.2 billion) in a fundraise planned later this year, three sources have said.The plan comes on the back of two successful rounds in the previous year, with the second round giving the Mumbai-headquartered company the coveted billion-dollar valuation (about Rs 7,000 crore), making it the newest unicorn in the country.“Nykaa will raise a round valuing it at Rs 9,000 crore this year, although they are still finalising how much they will raise. The purpose of this round is to set a price (valuation) before an initial public offering (IPO) in the next few years,” said one of the persons cited above.The company said in April 2019 it raised $14 million led by private equity firm TPG Growth. Later in the year, led by hedge fund Steadview Capital, it raised another $30 million via a secondary share sale by acquiring stakes of existing investors, the sources who wanted to remain anonymous said.The TPG round valued Nykaa at Rs 5,000 crore. While Steadview acquired most shares at the older valuation of Rs 5000 crore, a small part of the investment valued Nykaa at about Rs 7,000 crore.Steadview is also an investor in companies such as Flipkart, Ola and Dream11.“They don't necessarily need the capital for growth, since they have solid revenue growth and are profitable. It is more of a price-setting exercise, though the money may help grow specific segments,” the person added.While Nykaa declined to comment, Steadview did not respond to an email sent to it.Founded in 2012 by former investment banker Falguni Nayar, Nykaa started as a multi-brand online beauty retailer but has since branched into brick-and-mortar stores as well.It has also launched in-house lipsticks, eyeshadow, oils and facemasks brands among others.

Is the startup ecosystem maturing in India?,27 February,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s wish to make India the land of entrepreneurship, the government’s StartUp India initiative and policy tweaks to support new businesses do not seem to be paying off. The number of new startups in India has hit a nine-year low in 2019, according to a report in the Business Line.The number of new startups in 2019 fell to 5,462, a 35 percent drop from 2018. But this decline is not a surprise, it has been the trend since 2016. While there was a lot of fanfare and hype surrounding StartUp India, it has clearly failed to boost the sentiments and health of the startup ecosystem.That’s mainly because most of the promised Rs 10,000-crore fund support under StartUp India along with incentives of Rs 1,000 crore never came by.Still, the government is trying to do its bit with new incentives. In Union Budget 2020, the government has proposed seed fund support for early-stage startups and easing tax burden on startup employees among others. StartUp India’s blueprint also has plans for new incubators, accelerators and 100 new innovation zones by 2024 among the 19-point agenda.So, why did the startup frenzy fade away?First, the startup ecosystem has matured. Today, not everyone with an idea can get funding. Most of the ideas that might have easily attracted investors back in 2014-15 are unlikely to get any investment now. Investors have burnt their hands numerous times in the past few years and are now cautious. With fundraising becoming difficult every day, the euphoria among aspiring Indian youth to become entrepreneurs is gone.Second, the angel tax created havoc during the past couple of years. The inflow of seed capital, or angel investments, dropped by more than 20 percent during January-September 2018, compared with that of the same period a year ago.Third, paperwork and compliance with multiple regulations have always been pain points for startups and entrepreneurs. While India has jumped in the World Bank’s ease of doing business rankings, much work needs to be done to introduce clear and simpler guidelines for emerging businesses.Fourth, the economy is witnessing a slowdown, not just in India, but also globally. That has squeezed funding for startups, especially at the early stage.On the other hand, overall fund flow to India’s startup ecosystem has actually grown in 2019. As BusinessLine reported, around $20.44 billion has been pumped into Indian startups. That’s highest in the past five years.The truth is, startups that begun their journey five years ago, or so – and did not have to shut down -- are now raising larger amount of money in each round. Cautious investors are placing their bets on the ones with a tried-and-tested model hoping for better yields. That’s a natural progression, and this will continue to be the trend.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/opinion/is-the-startup-ecosystem-maturing-in-india-4982801.html,Funding,"The number of new startups in India has hit a nine-year low in 2019, according to a report in the Business Line.The number of new startups in 2019 fell to 5,462, a 35 percent drop from 2018.While there was a lot of fanfare and hype surrounding StartUp India, it has clearly failed to boost the sentiments and health of the startup ecosystem.That’s mainly because most of the promised Rs 10,000-crore fund support under StartUp India along with incentives of Rs 1,000 crore never came by.Still, the government is trying to do its bit with new incentives.","['the Business Line', 'StartUp India', 'StartUp India']",['around $20.44 billion']

Budget 2020: Reforms must to spur recovery in the real estate sector,31 January,"Anshuman MagazineIn line with its ambitious goal of making India a $5 trillion economy by 2025, the government needs to strike a fine balance between ease of doing business and ease of living.

A majority of capital inflows (57 percent) were from foreign players.The upcoming Union Budget 2020-21  raises expectations of holistic development through long-term solutions designed to stimulate demand across the industry, including real estate.Some of these expectations are listed below: NBFCs and HFCsCreation of a special purpose vehicle (SPV) to purchase assets from NBFCs would go a long way in providing these entities headroom to lend, considering that they are critical for last-mile funding.Funding should also be increased for the National Housing Bank (NHB) to allow cheaper mortgages, standardized costs of building materials, faster approval processes, and targeted fund allocation for low-cost housing projects.ECB norms should be relaxed for Housing Finance Companies (HFCs): Current norms state that it is mandatory to have a capital of more than Rs 300 crore and a track record of a minimum of five years. Since a majority of the HFCs catering to the affordable housing segment are relatively new, the norm can be relaxed to ease capital penetration to the affordable segment. The budget should widen the ambit of ECBs for construction finance to a broader range of housing (not limiting it to low-cost/ affordable housing). Affordable housingGovernment encouragement to states to provide land at subsidized rates and increase FSI would go a long way in boosting affordable housing.It should also look at a lower/ waive off stamp duty for home loans of up to Rs 10-15 lakh for the LIG/EWS segment across the country.For MIG I and MIG II categories, CLSS norms related to household income and eligible housing loan amount should be relaxed:MIG 1 – income limit of Rs 6-12 lakh can be increased to Rs 18 lakh; loan limit can be extended from Rs 9 lakh to Rs 12 lakh.MIG 2 – income limit of Rs 12-18 lakh can be increased to up to Rs 25 lakh; loan limit can be extended from Rs 12 lakh to Rs 18 lakh.Reduce taxation  The sunset clause needs an extension, especially in the midst of the anticipated impact of automation and technology on the IT sector. Withdrawal of any tax incentives from SEZs might hit exports and job creation. The incentives can be phased out in a truncated manner; for instance, reduce incentives from 100  percent deduction to 75 percent and so on.Income tax credit should be restored  The developer community is seeking 100 percent ITC as granted with 12 percent tax. However, a 5 percent GST with no ITC means input prices might increase, which will eventually be passed onto buyers.Separate deduction for home loan principal: The deduction under Section 80C also covers principal repayment on home loan deduction. This needs to be done away with and a separate deduction should be allowed for repayment of principal on home loans.Cement (28 percent) and steel (18 percent) should attract a lower GST. One of the reasons why the government has kept materials, such as sand, granite, bricks etc., in the 5 percent bracket, but kept cement in the 28 percent bracket is the widespread use of cement in government-led infrastructure projects. Cartelization of cement and monopoly of prices by leading cement companies has been a major concern for the government. The government is also concerned that a tax cut could result into reduced revenues, even as there will be no surety on input tax credit (ITC) being passed on to buyers. Hence, it is recommended that the government bring out specific guidelines on setting prices and transfer of ITC for the cement industry and reduce the GST on cement to 18  percent or even lower.Infrastructure statusWhile infrastructure status has already been granted to affordable housing and logistics, it should now be extended to integrated townships and the entire real estate sector, especially post the implementation of RERA and other structural policy reforms.ConclusionThe government has remained quite pro-active in stemming the effects of a manufacturing and consumption slowdown by addressing liquidity challenges faced by NBFCs and banks as well as by easing investment inflows into the country.However, it now needs to back up these measures by boosting consumption across the country. One way of doing this could be by boosting employment through schemes such as MGNREGA and by providing incentives to SMEs and MSMEs. Also, push for execution of large-scale infrastructure projects would not just encourage investment inflows, but would also boost job creation.Further, an increase in fund allocation is critical to boosting rural consumption; this would boost village economy and raise incomes, particularly of small and marginal farmers.The author is Chairman and CEO, India, South East Asia, Middle East and Africa, CBRE ",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/real-estate/on-hold-for-friday-budget-2020-reforms-must-to-spur-recovery-in-the-real-estate-sector-4883181.html,Funding,"Affordable housingGovernment encouragement to states to provide land at subsidized rates and increase FSI would go a long way in boosting affordable housing.It should also look at a lower/ waive off stamp duty for home loans of up to Rs 10-15 lakh for the LIG/EWS segment across the country.For MIG I and MIG II categories, CLSS norms related to household income and eligible housing loan amount should be relaxed:MIG 1 – income limit of Rs 6-12 lakh can be increased to Rs 18 lakh; loan limit can be extended from Rs 9 lakh to Rs 12 lakh.MIG 2 – income limit of Rs 12-18 lakh can be increased to up to Rs 25 lakh; loan limit can be extended from Rs 12 lakh to Rs 18 lakh.Reduce taxation  The sunset clause needs an extension, especially in the midst of the anticipated impact of automation and technology on the IT sector.Hence, it is recommended that the government bring out specific guidelines on setting prices and transfer of ITC for the cement industry and reduce the GST on cement to 18  percent or even lower.Infrastructure statusWhile infrastructure status has already been granted to affordable housing and logistics, it should now be extended to integrated townships and the entire real estate sector, especially post the implementation of RERA and other structural policy reforms.ConclusionThe government has remained quite pro-active in stemming the effects of a manufacturing and consumption slowdown by addressing liquidity challenges faced by NBFCs and banks as well as by easing investment inflows into the country.However, it now needs to back up these measures by boosting consumption across the country.","['FSI', 'ITC', 'RERA']","['$5 trillion', '$6.06 billion', '$4.76 billion']"

"PSBs may adopt cash flow model, ditch asset-based funding: Report",03 January,"Public sector banks (PSBs), starting with the State Bank of India (SBI), are looking to update their corporate lending practices from the present asset-based funding model to the one that is more reliant on measured cash flow statements, The Economic Times reported.The matter was discussed during the Indian Banks’ Association meeting in December.

"Trouble in realty: Loans worth $14 bn under 'severe' stress, says study",02 December,"Nearly $14 billion worth of loans to the real estate sector by banks and NBFCs/HFCs is currently under ‘severe’ stress, according to a study by ANAROCK Capital.'Severe' stress essentially means the concerned developers are highly leveraged and either have limited or extremely poor visibility of debt servicing due to a combination of factors, as per the report.ANAROCK also pointed out that while $58 billion of the total loans is currently completely stress-free, there is some pressure on about $21 billion which can potentially be resolved.The entire ‘severe stressed’ loan value in real estate is spread across more than 50 developers, it said.In terms of the overall realty loans with respect to builder-type, out of the total $93 billion realty loans, Grade A builders received over $65 billion worth of loan advances, followed by Grade B players at $27 billion and Grade C developers a mere $1 billion.This presents a relatively safe outlook because more than 72 percent of the loans given to Grade A builders is safe and under no stress, the report said.However, loans to Grade B and C developers need strict monitoring. Nearly 28 percent of the loans given to Grade B developers is under ‘severe’ stress while for Grade C developers it is over 19 percent. However, this collectively equals to less than mere $8 billion of overall stressed loan.Grade A developers are players that are currently active, with excellent execution track record and having till date developed real estate in excess of 3 mn sq ft. Grade B developers include those with an established execution track record having developable area between 1 mn sq ft and 3 mn sq ft and are currently active.

"1,665 RERA-registered housing projects delayed by over five years: Report",20 November,"As many as 1,665 RERA-registered housing projects have been delayed by over five years across India and likely to be completed only after 2020. Nearly 880 projects consisting of over two lakh units are from the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) alone, data available with PropTiger.com indicated.A total of 125 projects are delayed across Noida, Greater Noida and Gurugram markets, consisting of over one lakh housing units.“Liquidity issues could be cited as the single biggest reason behind project delays in India, a phenomenon that has had an absolutely negative impact on buyer sentiment. The Rs 25,000-crore lifeline extended by the government in the form of an AIF would change much of that,” said Mani Rangarajan, Group COO, Elara Technologies, a real estate technology platform that owns PropTiger.com, Housing.com and Makaan.com.“Housing projects in the MMR are more likely to meet the net-worth-positive and litigation-free conditions set under the AIF. This would mean a large part of the fund could be spent on completing projects in the Mumbai market. Because Mumbai is an expensive property market, the cost of project completion here would be comparatively lower than the ultimate price realisation. This would only help Mumbai’s case further,” he added.Real estate developers in Noida owned the city authority a whopping Rs 10,200 crore in dues in 2017.Hyderabad and Pune follow MMR in the list, wherein as many as 276 and 241 housing projects have been delayed for over five years. In terms of units, however, Hyderabad has one of the lowest scores at 15,138 delayed homes, in the list of 10 cities. In Pune, over 47,000 housing units, delayed for more than half a decade, would reach completion post-2020, data showed.Chennai has the lowest number of delayed projects (24) as well as units (11,679), primarily because the size of housing projects in this property market is comparatively smaller. Typically, builders launch housing projects with 50 units or less in Chennai which could be completed in a shorter time span. The chances of cost overruns in such projects are also low.The markets covered in the analysis are Ahmedabad, Bengaluru, Chennai, Gurugram, Hyderabad, Kolkata, Mumbai, Noida-Greater Noida and Pune.

"Delayed projects in some states may not benefit from Rs 25,000-crore realty fund",08 November,"While the real estate fund worth Rs 25,000 crore announced by the government on November 6 seeks to provide relief to homebuyers and real estate developers, it may not benefit homebuyers of delayed or stuck projects in states and Union Territories without established regulatory authorities or their own Acts.Also buyers, in states that have kept ongoing projects out of RERA's ambit, may not benefit.In a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, The Forum for People's Collective Efforts (FPCE) has said that ""some states have decided to either illegally remove 'ongoing projects' from RERA or go slow in implementing RERA. This is  beyond the control of homebuyers. Homebuyers of delayed projects in these states cannot be punished for no fault on their part.""The announcement on November 6 makes it clear that the stress funding may not be available to projects that have not been registered under RERA.

States and Union Territories such as Arunachal Pradesh, Lakshadweep, Meghalaya, Nagaland and Sikkim do not yet have an Authority.West Bengal has enacted its own Act West Bengal Housing Industry Regulation Act, 2017. As per an Anarock estimate, there are around 13,000 delayed units in Kolkata alone (launched before or during 2013) worth Rs 7300 crore.Homebuyers in their letter to the PM have said that West Bengal ""has chosen not to implement RERA, but has enacted its own law - West Bengal Housing Industry Regulation Act, 2017 (WBHIRA). This is in gross violation of the Constitution and in complete disregard of a Parliamentary law. However, we have challenged the constitutional validity of WBHIRA before the Hon’ble Supreme Court.There are some states like Telangana, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Punjab, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh which through their rules under the Real Estate Act (RERA) have illegally kept either all ongoing projects or some out if out from the ambit of RERA. There are other like Himachal Pradesh and Kerala where regulatory authorities have just been constituted and hence significant number of projects are yet to be registered.""The act of West Bengal to enact WBHIRA and ignore RERA; or that of some States to either illegally remove ‘ongoing projects’ from RERA or go slow in implementing RERA, has been beyond the control of homebuyers. Inspite of our repeated appeals to the State Governments, there is no respite for homebuyers from these delays / illegalities,"" the letter said.Homebuyers have demanded that a task force be formed under the housing ministry consisting representatives of homebuyers, Mo/HUA officials, state governments officials, financial institutions, independent persons of repute, industry experts (other than builders) to identify projects nearing completion which should be taken first for completion, to monitor end use of funds disbursed and progress of construction in such projects, the letter says.Homebuyers said that the task force should identify a Public-Sector Enterprise who may be assigned the job to complete such identified projects under its supervision. The task force should prepare timelines for completion of all such delayed projects and should also assign due priority according to the status of completion of each project.""Depending upon the magnitude, multiple task force may be constituted representing each zone. Also committee of homebuyers of respective projects should be formed to keep close watch on progress of project and to receive feedback of any wrong doing. No builder should be a part of such task force since the entire exercise will be primarily against their misdeeds and hence they may use their influence to derail the whole process to ensure favor for their own projects,"" the letter said.Homebuyers also requested that no funds should be disbursed directly to builders.Some states have excluded ongoing projects from RERA registrationTelangana and some other states may also face a challenge. Telangana rules clearly state allowed not to register projects prior to January 1, 2017.“Ongoing projects means a project where development is going on and for which occupation certificate or completion certificate has not been issued but excludes such projects for which building permits were approved prior to 1.1.2017.”There may be 23 such projects in the state that have been on an average delayed for more than seven years, says B T Srinivasan, vice president, FPCE and in-charge for Telangana and Andhra.According to  Harsh Vardhan Patodia of Credai Bengal, the body is examining the ‘technical issue’ with regard to RERA registration in West Bengal.""If the law says that the project has to be registered with RERA, I think there will be a technical problem for us to access that fund. We have to find a legal way to resolve this. Mandate may not permit them (the government) to give funds to projects that are not registered with RERA.

"Freshworks valued at $3.5 billion in $150 million fund-raise from Google, Sequoia, Accel",04 November,"Freshworks, the Chennai-based software products and services company, has closed a $150-million (Rs 1,050 crore) funding round with existing investors that include Google, Sequoia and Accel, sources have told Moneycontrol.“The funding round was closed on Friday,” said one of the sources. The company also crossed $200 million in annual recurring revenue, Freshworks' founder CEO Girish Mathrubootham told employees at an event to mark the startup's ninth anniversary.The latest round of funding, eighth since Freshworks first raised capital in 2011, values the company at $3.5 billion. “This is a pre-IPO (initial public offering) round, which sets the valuation of the company and also puts a benchmark to what each Freshworks share could be valued at,” said a second source.Freshworks could raise more funds before listing its shares by 2021.Before the eighth round, Freshworks, a business-to-business company, had raised $249 million.

Paytm Mall ex-COO Amit Sinha to raise $8 million for agri-tech venture Unnati,29 October,"It’s back to the roots for Amit Sinha, the former Paytm Mall chief operating officer.Sinha, who quit Paytm Mall three months ago, is pushing big for Unnati, an agri-tech startup aimed at helping farmers improve productivity, and plans to raise $6-8 million in a Series A funding round.He wants to offer agricultural loans to farmers at nominal rates, a move aimed at turning Unnati, which loosely translates to progress, into a one-stop solution for all farming needs.""We will be hitting the market next month. We have kept two options open. One, is to raise a small bridge round and then go for a larger Series A, else raise a Series A of around $6-8 million straight,"" Sinha told Moneycontrol.Registered under the parent name of Akshamaala Solutions Pvt Ltd, Unnati was launched by Sinha and his friend, Ashok Prasad, in 2017.The venture offers support services to farmers to improve yield. It also connects them to local retailers to procure agri-inputs such as sugarcane, corn, paddy, soybean, wheat and vegetable, thus acting as an e-commerce platform as well.Unnati is operational in select villages of Uttar Pradesh and plans are afoot to take it to Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra and Rajasthan by the year-end.Sinha wants to further the venture into the fin-tech category by offering agricultural loans to farmers in partnership with non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) at a monthly interest rate of 2-2.5%. The company would apply for an NBFC licence soon, Sinha said.Unnati claims to have $15 million run rate with over two lakh farmers on board.""We see this as a digital platform for agriculture. We have given digital cards to farmers and it has a closed-loop wallet. The idea is to give a 360-degree hand-holding to farmers,"" said Sinha. The funds would be used for enhancing technology and expanding operations, he added.According to reports, India has over 119 million landholder farmers, with only 18% of them reliant on formal source of credit. On average, a farmer in India pays approximately 15 to 20% of his income and about 50% of his gross margin towards interest.Sinha, along with Prasad, has invested close to $100,000 in the company. He also plans to participate in the upcoming round along with the new investors.While he didn't name the investors who had shown interest in the startup, marquee names have invested in this segment in the last one year.According to a Nasscom report, within agri-tech, some of the emerging business opportunities are in market linkage, digital agriculture and better access to inputs.The sector has managed to raise $248 million as of June, with big names such as Tiger Global investing $89 million in B2B agri-tech firm Ninjacart.Unnati is expected to cover a bunch of segments such as market linkage, digital handholding and financing. It will be going up against multiple startups offering similar services.CropIn, for instance, is a B2B full-stack startup and has raised $8 million from investors such as Chiratae Ventures and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation Strategic Investment Fund. It offers data-driven farming and derives real-time insights on standing crop and projects based on weather information.Another startup, Agrostar, offers agricultural inputs at a fair price and had raised $27 million in a round led by Bertelsmann India and existing investor Chirate Ventures, among others. It allows farmers to buy seed, crop and hardware by just giving a missed call or through the app.Sinha's exit from Paytm Mall came after over a decade of service across multiple functions.

"Will a Rs 10,000cr stressed asset fund rescue the real estate sector?",11 September,"Over the last few weeks there has been talk that the government may unveil a set of measures that may include a stressed asset fund for the real estate sector, especially aimed at bailing out stalled housing projects where lakhs of homebuyers have invested their hard-earned money and have not received possession for over a decade.Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman has hinted that the government will be unveiling a set of measures aimed at resolving issues being faced by homebuyers stuck in housing projects in the NCR (National Capital Region) and Mumbai.""We have had consultations with homebuyers , who have paid their advances and sitting without knowing what to do, and promoters that are sitting with no money to further their projects,” the finance minister had said.Housing and Urban Affairs Minister Hardeep Singh Puri said remedial measures would be taken on the three big real estate projects in Delhi-NCR – Unitech, Amrapali and Jaypee – thanks to action by the Supreme Court.ANAROCK research said as many as 220 projects, equalling 1.74 lakh homes, are completely stalled in the top seven cities alone. Launched either in 2013 or before, these projects have absolutely no construction activity going on. The overall value of all stalled units is estimated to be more than Rs 177,400 crore. Most projects have been grounded due to either liquidity issues or on account of litigation.NCR has the largest pile-up of stalled units at 1.18 lakh homes (68 percent of the total stuck stock) spread over 67 projects, with an overall value of Rs 82,200 crore. Of this, nearly 69 percent (or 83,470 units) are already sold out.MMR follows next with nearly 38,060 units stuck at various stages. However, the number of projects covering stuck units in MMR is higher than NCR. Stalled units in MMR span over 89 projects as against 67 in NCR.  In value terms, MMR is quite close to NCR, with stalled units worth over Rs 80,200 crore as against Rs 82,200 crore for NCR.Will an Rs 10,000 crore stressed asset fund be enough?A homebuyers’ body -- Forum for Peoples' Collective Efforts (FPCE) -- told the finance minister that five lakh homebuyers are stuck in various projects across India and demanded creation of a Rs 10,000 crore stress fund to complete such projects.""The objective should be to complete all pending real estate projects within a span of five years by providing for such a stress fund continuously for the next five years,"" the forum said in a list of recommendations submitted to the finance minister.The stressed asset fund would initially kick-start a stuck project. Subsequently, all money siphoned off by the builder, payments received from homebuyers and realisation on account of unsold units should be brought into the stressed project. Only the shortfall amount should be utilised from the stressed asset fund, homebuyers said.Buyers feel steps should be taken to ensure that promoters of stalled projects, who are utilising proceeds from the stress fund, should be stripped of all their personal and company's assets to realise the funds utilised for completion of those projects. They should also be permanently barred from carrying on business.""To achieve this within a reasonable time frame, extra power should be given to authorities for seizure and attachment so as to complete the entire exercise within six months,"" they added.Niranjan Hiranandani, National President, Naredco, said the NCR region alone accounts for more than two lakh incomplete apartments. “Those are the ones for which we are seeking a stressed asset fund, which would be the last mile funding. We look forward to see how the stressed asset fund can be raised. We have suggested the LIFO (last in first out) method for the purpose of funding for the stressed asset fund. This can be done quickly if the government gives necessary directions in this regard,” he said.Some developers are of the view that Rs 10,000 crore is only a drop in the ocean, an amount just enough to take care of Amrapali’s stuck projects.Pankaj Bajaj, Managing Director, Eldeco Group, said that neither Rs 2,000 crore nor Rs 10,000 crore is enough. ""No stress fund can take care of this problem. Ultimately banks have to start lending again. No stressed asset fund can solve a problem of this magnitude. Rs 10,000 crore is just enough to take care of Amrapali’s woes. To complete all stressed projects spread across the country, we may require over Rs 1 lakh crore.""Bajaj feels the government should provide a one-time window for restructuring of real estate loans. ""We don’t want any dole, just give us a moratorium of eight to nine months, so that the focus is on construction. After that take the money back with interest,” he added.The way forwardIn case a stressed asset fund is constituted, FPCE feels developers should not be given a bailout package. ""Why should taxpayers be footing money required by builders who have delayed projects?  Every penny utilised for the purpose of project completion should be recovered from builders. This is important to ensure that the sector does not fall into the same trap again,"" its President Abhay Upadhyay said.Experts feel the role of the task force should be to identify stalled projects, assess how much money is needed, and how much can be recovered.“A taskforce should map all stuck projects across the country, the number of years they have been delayed and then segregate them in different buckets say beyond five years, beyond 10 years, beyond three to four years et al.  The taskforce should then give priority to the ‘most' and 'extremely' stressed projects, assess the amount available and funds required to complete these projects,” an industry expert said.Experts feel that the stressed asset fund should not be used for projects launched post-implementation of RERA. “It should be used only for ancestral projects, projects that have been delayed beyond five years. RERA should be held accountable if delays have happened after its introduction,” an expert said.They want projects that are the worst affected to be completed first to get back investor confidence.Vandana.ramnani@nw18.com",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/real-estate/will-a-rs-10000cr-stressed-asset-fund-rescue-the-real-estate-sector-4421831.html,Funding,"Over the last few weeks there has been talk that the government may unveil a set of measures that may include a stressed asset fund for the real estate sector, especially aimed at bailing out stalled housing projects where lakhs of homebuyers have invested their hard-earned money and have not received possession for over a decade.Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman has hinted that the government will be unveiling a set of measures aimed at resolving issues being faced by homebuyers stuck in housing projects in the NCR (National Capital Region) and Mumbai.This is important to ensure that the sector does not fall into the same trap again,"" its President Abhay Upadhyay said.Experts feel the role of the task force should be to identify stalled projects, assess how much money is needed, and how much can be recovered.“A taskforce should map all stuck projects across the country, the number of years they have been delayed and then segregate them in different buckets say beyond five years, beyond 10 years, beyond three to four years et al.","['NCR', 'National Capital Region']",[]

PE investments into student housing only $60m: Anarock,01 July,"Private equity investments into student housing were as minimal as $60 million in the last two years.

"PE inflows in residential at 4-year low, commercial at 4-year high: Report",26 March,"Institutional investors invested more than $4 billion funds across the country's real estate segments in 2018. Total private equity inflows in residential segment stood at $266 million in 2018, an 82 percent decline since 2015. Commercial real estate drew the lion’s share with USD 2.8 billion in PE funds, says a report.The average deal size increased by over 170 percent in four years – from $47 million in 2015 to $128 million in 2018. Overall the real estate sector attracted over $4 billion of PE funds in 2018; a decline of 9 percent against 2017. In less than 3 months into 2019, PE equity investment into real estate are close to $1 billion, according to a report by Anarock titled Private Equity in Indian Real Estate.At the city-level, Mumbai continued to be the most-preferred destination for overall PE investments, seeing nearly 38 percent of the total capital inflows in 2018. Hyderabad witnessed a sudden burst in investments in 2018, attracting more than $1.1 billion of private equity — a more than three-fold increase in investments compared to the collective previous three-year period. Hyderabad surpassed Bengaluru and Chennai, the other two major South Indian cities, in investment inflows, says the report.The commercial office segment saw the highest inflows, accounting for a massive 70 percent share of the total institutional investments into the industry in 2018. Retail real estate came in a distant second with 7 percent and the residential sector drew the least private equity among the three sectors, with less than 7 percent of the overall share.The report says that out of the total PE inflow of USD 14 bn into the sector in the last four years, 2017 and 2018 collectively saw the maximum investments to the tune of USD 8.6 billion.""Currently, funding is a major hurdle for the Indian real estate’s growth prospects – especially post the NBFC crisis. Private equity funding is the best alternative for developers who qualify for it. Despite a decline of 9 percent in PE inflows in 2018 against the preceding year, 2019 will bring a marked increase in private equity funding because of India’s first REIT listing,"" says Shobhit Agarwal, MD & CEO - ANAROCK Capital.""From this point onward, commercial real estate — especially Grade A office spaces — will attract considerable investments,"" he says. ""Nevertheless, much of the industry's prospects also hinge on the outcome of the upcoming general elections. Institutional investors will continue to pump in funds into the real estate industry if they can rely on political stability, proactive policies and a favourable microeconomic environment.""The report further states that despite deal numbers declining since 2015, the average deal size has increased by nearly 172 percent in the last four years — from $47 million in 2015 to $128 million in 2018. Interestingly, the top 5 deals in 2018 alone contributed almost 50 percent of the total investments during the year. PE investors have become more cautious about selecting and associating with developers; however, once confident, they are making larger investments.""A segment-wise breakdown indicates that commercial realty saw an annual increase of 27 percent in PE investments – from nearly USD 2.2 bn in 2017 to over USD 2.8 billion in 2018,"" says Agarwal. ""High occupancy levels, relatively lower rentals in dollar terms, quality Grade A assets and high-quality tenants are the key reasons for commercial space to draw around 70 percent of the overall share of the total private equity investments in 2018. Considering high demand, fund exits have been relatively easier in commercial real estate - and with REITs being launched, they will become even easier.""Also, investors’ interest in long-term real estate plays with preferred developers continues to be visible with more than USD 500 million of additional platforms getting created in just 2.5 months. As we speak, the REIT offering by the Blackstone – Embassy Group is ongoing. If the interest for this new investment platform is as expected, it will open a new chapter in the country’s real estate space.Going forward in 2019, institutional investors are likely to continue infusing investments into the maturing Indian real estate market, which offers more scope for growth than developed countries with matured real estate markets.

Comment | New angel tax norms are in the right direction,20 February,"Sounak MitraThe latest notification by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade has put most of the early-stage startups out of the purview of the devil called the angel tax. But it came with some riders.The government has redefined startups and relaxed norms on who can avail exemption from angel tax. An entity can now be termed a startup up to 10 years (up from 7 years) since the date of incorporation, provided it has not crossed Rs 100 crore in revenue in a single year. The limit was Rs 25 crore earlier. This is likely to cover most of the early-stage startups.The limit for investment that will be exempt from the purview of angel tax has been increased from Rs 10 crore to Rs 25 crore. This makes sense, considering the fact that most of the initial rounds of funding don’t exceed that limit. However, it is not clear what happens when a company raises funds twice or thrice from multiple sources in a single year and the cumulative funding exceeds the Rs 25 crore limit.The rule barring startups from investing in securities is going to hurt the entire ecosystem. As VCCircle pointed out in a report, most of them “temporarily park” raised funds in “debt mutual funds” until they need to use it. No company would require all the money raised in one go. But, investing them in any securities-linked instrument would debar them from availing angel tax exemption. Besides, there is no clarification on what would happen to the interest they might earn if they just put the funds in bank.Interestingly, the latest notification did not say anything about the investor profile. If the earlier definition stays in force, then only people with more than Rs 50 lakh of annual income and net worth of Rs 2 crore will be eligible to invest. This is to restrict small investors, especially individuals. But the issue here is that most ventures start with investments or loans from friends and family members. This is one area that the Government needs to have a relook and liberalise it so that StartUpIndia Mission gets a boost and the country is in a position to become the incubation bed for innovative startups.As the Economic Times reported, the latest notification would “force” startups to seek funds from venture capitals and formal angel groups and not wealthy individuals. The only respite, however, is that the Government has excluded investment from non-resident Indians as individuals, alternative investment funds (category I) and listed Indian companies with net worth of at least Rs 100 crore (or turnover of at least Rs 250 crore) from the angel tax net.Also, the rule on restricting startups from owning vehicles exceeding Rs 10 lakh does not make much sense.The concept of angel tax is based on Government’s aim to arrest money laundering. While there is no evidence that startup funding has been used as a channel for illegal activity linked to money from undisclosed sources, the Government has been quite determined to keep startup funding under check.The reality is that startups get very limited funding from domestic sources. According to market estimates, just about 10 percent of around $38.5 billion funds that Indian startups got came from domestic sources. Liberalising startup funding can pave the way for higher economic growth.The Government’s latest move on the issue of angel tax is a step forward, but the riders are unlikely to please the startup fraternity.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/opinion/comment-new-angel-tax-norms-are-in-the-right-direction-3563171.html,Funding,"This is one area that the Government needs to have a relook and liberalise it so that StartUpIndia Mission gets a boost and the country is in a position to become the incubation bed for innovative startups.As the Economic Times reported, the latest notification would “force” startups to seek funds from venture capitals and formal angel groups and not wealthy individuals.The only respite, however, is that the Government has excluded investment from non-resident Indians as individuals, alternative investment funds (category I) and listed Indian companies with net worth of at least Rs 100 crore (or turnover of at least Rs 250 crore) from the angel tax net.Also, the rule on restricting startups from owning vehicles exceeding Rs 10 lakh does not make much sense.The concept of angel tax is based on Government’s aim to arrest money laundering.","['Government', 'StartUpIndia Mission', 'the Economic Times', 'Government']",['around $38.5 billion']
Budget 2019: Augmented budgetary allocation must to boost infra sector,30 January,"Anoop KalavathThe infrastructure sector is a key driver for the Indian economy and the most tangible evidence of the nation’s progress. Investment in this sector has a cascading impact on all sectors such as banking and financial sector, logistics, power sector. Infrastructure sector also aids in employment generation and socio-economic development of the country. Owing to its importance, one ought to look into the infrastructure bottlenecks and address recommendations for the same.As per Global Infrastructure Outlook, India requires around USD 4.5 trillion worth of investments till 2040 to develop infrastructure. However, the current trend demonstrates that India can meet around USD 3.9 trillion out of USD 4.5 trillion. This adverse gap is mainly due to the collapse of public-private partnership, and issues related to land and forest clearances. In view of this, the sector looks forward to a higher allocation in the forthcoming budget.Of late, a number of infrastructure companies are under stress due to financial hardships. An alarming number of power generation companies have been referred to National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT).  The budget should come up with some rehabilitation scheme for the sick power industry.Given the need to urgently upgrade infrastructure, the government should reduce import duty on capital goods required for major infrastructure projects like metro/port/airport etc. Additionally, it is recommended that temporary imports of capital goods required for the said infrastructure projects which are to be subsequently re-exported be granted exemption from levy of customs duty.The government should also consider introducing direct tax incentives such as reducing the Minimum Alternate Tax (MAT) and Dividend Distribution Tax (DDT).Further, deepening of bond markets by introducing long-term tax-free bonds shall enhance support to long-term infrastructure financing given the twin challenges faced by commercial banks i.e. asset-liability management and increasing share of stressed assets.Since the infrastructure sector is capital intensive in nature, the same results in its heavy dependence on borrowings. It is thereby recommended to increase the upper cap on interest deduction. Likewise, there upsurges a need for a greater moratorium on loan repayment.Of late, private players and institutions dedicated for infrastructure financing are reluctant to come forward and invest in this sector due to issues such as lengthy dispute resolution, stuck claims, delays, cost-overruns, etc. In order to boost investment in infrastructure sector, the budget may provide for incentives such as extension of tax holidays for infrastructure projects, reduction in taxation, etc.It is noteworthy to mention that rapid urbanisation has created increased demand for civic facilities and transport infrastructure. The government has emphasized on roadways, railways, airports and ports infrastructure development. Metros are rapidly being accepted across the country as a solution to the problem of urban transportation.Accordingly, it is recommended that benefit vide Central Board of Direct Taxation (CBDT)’s clarification of considering expenditure incurred on development and maintenance of infrastructure projects like roads/highways on a build-operate-transfer (B-O-T) (amortised over the period of the concession) be extended to metro rail systems.There is a dire need to give impetus to the infrastructure sector in view of its capital-intensive nature and long gestation period for infrastructure projects. Hence, augmented budgetary allocation, tax incentives, strong reinforcement of investment in the sector and key policies would ensure time-bound creation of world-class infrastructure and propel India’s overall development.Anoop Kalavath is senior director, Deloitte India; Maitri Vikam (manager with Deloitte Haskins & Sells LLP) and Lakshita Shah (assistant manager with Deloitte Haskins & Sells LLP) also contributed to the article.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/real-estate/budget-2019-augmented-budgetary-allocation-must-to-boost-infra-sector-3453841.html,Funding,"Additionally, it is recommended that temporary imports of capital goods required for the said infrastructure projects which are to be subsequently re-exported be granted exemption from levy of customs duty.The government should also consider introducing direct tax incentives such as reducing the Minimum Alternate Tax (MAT) and Dividend Distribution Tax (DDT).Further, deepening of bond markets by introducing long-term tax-free bonds shall enhance support to long-term infrastructure financing given the twin challenges faced by commercial banks i.e. asset-liability management and increasing share of stressed assets.Since the infrastructure sector is capital intensive in nature, the same results in its heavy dependence on borrowings.Metros are rapidly being accepted across the country as a solution to the problem of urban transportation.Accordingly, it is recommended that benefit vide Central Board of Direct Taxation (CBDT)’s clarification of considering expenditure incurred on development and maintenance of infrastructure projects like roads/highways on a build-operate-transfer (B-O-T) (amortised over the period of the concession) be extended to metro rail systems.There is a dire need to give impetus to the infrastructure sector in view of its capital-intensive nature and long gestation period for infrastructure projects.","['Dividend Distribution Tax', 'Central Board of Direct Taxation']",['USD 4.5 trillion']

Speciale Invest to fund online poker platform Pocket52,24 December,"Bangalore-based online poker platform Pocket52, has taken a major step in evolving the Random Number Generator technology. Speciale Invest led an investor group to raise an undisclosed seed fund for Pocket52.The Bangalore-based company run by IIT Bombay graduate Nitesh Salvi along with other co-founders – Saurav Suman (COO), Debashish Bhattacharjee (CMO) and Satyam Verma (CTO) – wants to use their funds in planning an expanding consumer business.Nitesh’s first venture Plancess, which was one of the top-ranked Ed-tech startups, was later acquired by the Career Point Group of Kota. Nitesh, who has been a poker player from his IIT Bombay days, took up building a poker space online after a decade of unsatisfactory experiences. Nitesh, along with the founding team, aims to reconstruct the online poker experience with the help of ‘Data and Machine Learning’.Arjun Rao, general partner at Speciale Invest said, “Pocket52’s vision to bring technological innovations to the Indian online gaming sector is encouraging. They have a strong product differentiation around the game-play. Their integrity levels, fairness, and high-quality player engagement strengthen our confidence in them.”Rao mentioned a special feature about the poker platform. “The RNG+ technology, employed by Pocket52,  is an additional security layer in their online card shuffle process.

"Purchase in Delhi, redeem in Dubai: How VClusive's loyalty programme works across luxury brands",24 December,"What if your breakfast at a café in Delhi could buy you dinner at a fine dining restaurant in Dubai? How about shopping at Burberry and collecting some reward points that you can encash when you are buying your next lehenga from Sabyasachi? Sounds confusing right? Especially, because reward points are only for a particular brand.Well not anymore. Not when you are a connoisseur of luxury. Thanks to VClusive.VClusive is India’s first reward points programme across luxury brands that provides exclusive access, customized rewards and a host of other privileges to compliment the high life.How does it work?VClusive works on the simple model of ‘earn and burn’ said the owners.“We’re present across Bangalore, Chandigarh, Chennai, Delhi, Goa, Hyderabad, Kolkata, Mumbai and Dubai with our network of over 300 national and international brand partners.

The luxury reward programme presently has 3 lakh members collecting and encashing stars all over the world. The typical customer, according to Singh, is between 30 and 50 years old.One would wonder why brands wouldn’t sell the idea of their own loyalty programme and what do they get out of their association with VClusive.Well, VClusive also curates luxury products from around the world with the convenience of shopping on-the-go with their online marketplaces –  #GlobalShop and #IndiaShop on the app itself. It guides customers to pick up stores where they can find what they are looking for.VClusive charges the brand 10 percent every time a transaction happens, something they call the ‘success fee’.VClusive already has operations in Dubai and its operations will take off in Singapore by the third quarter of 2019.

Quick Take | Swiggy's $1billion funding does not mean it can win the food delivery sweepstakes,21 May,"How Swiggy uses the $1billion or Rs 7,000 crore it has raised from existing and new investors, will determine if it can take a convincing lead in the food delivery market. On December 20, food delivery company Swiggy raised $1 billion from existing investors Naspers, DST Global, Meituan Dianping, Coatue Management and new investors Tencent, Hillhouse and Wellington Management Company.While this round of funding values Swiggy at $3.3 billion, it may not be enough to ensure the five-year old start-up hogs the last mile to the Indian consumer’s stomach. Food delivery in India is still a top-town phenomena, and the market is overcrowded due to low-entry barriers.Swiggy has competition from other food delivery companies and even ride-hailing companies Uber and Ola have entered the market. These companies too are well-funded, even though food is not their core offering. Uber Eats and Ola's FoodPanda will keep investing in food delivery. That means competition will keep getting tougher. Plus, there’s Zomato with a wider presence and it is also raising funds.True, Swiggy has grown fast in the past six months. It added 42 cities, and its gross merchandise value doubled. But it is not easy to sustain that pace of growth. Even Swiggy co-founder Sriharsha Majety, in an e-mail to employees after the latest round of fund raising, said: ""Fundraising makes sure we don’t lose but does not make sure we win.""Majety has also said, in an interview in August, that Swiggy’s priority is growth, and not profitability. To be sure, Swiggy does not make money. It reported a loss of Rs 397 crore in the year to March 2018, up from Rs 205 crore the previous year. Its revenue was Rs 468 crore in FY2018, as compared with Rs 146 crore the year ago.Still, investors were convinced by Swiggy’s growth plans, enough to fork out $1billion in hard cash. Now, Swiggy has to find a niche or a business model, where it earns enough from supplying food to consumers.It is debatable if plain food delivery can be that model. Swiggy’s gross merchandise value doubled due to fresh customer acquisition. Most of these customers turned to Swiggy because of the discounts on offer.If discount is the driver then more can play that game. Everyone in this space offers discounts, and higher the discount, more are the orders.Consumers need to be able to see what makes Swiggy better than its rivals, such as Zomato, Uber Eats, Ola's FoodPanda, or others. All of them are going hyper local, and most restaurants are there on all these food delivery platforms.This market will remain hyper-competitive, with a scramble to sign on restaurants and consumers and become a permanent link between the two. There were some 400 food delivery apps that were functioning between 2013 and 2016 in India, with most of them serving one or two cities. Every now and then, new hyper-local firm enter the food delivery market, forcing the bigger players to fight back.If discount is the strategy to build scale, then fund-raising becomes the main fuel. But raising money may not be easy going forward. Also, this market has seen new firms such as artificial intelligence based Dishq and B2B player HungerBox that are attracting investor interest.Swiggy has said it wants to use the money for expansion, to enter new hyper-local services, and next-generation technology such as artificial intelligence. These are expected to help the company find new areas of growth.Some of the funds raised are likely go towards discounts too. Besides, Swiggy has been investing in food-making companies to establish kitchens dedicated to food delivery. There is the risk that some of these companies will take their business to other food delivery apps later.The company expects to use the raised funds over next 2-3 years. But, if rivals also raise funds and pump in more money, then Swiggy's Rs 7,000 crore will burn sooner.Though it may not be an apple-to-apple comparison, this could lead Swiggy to a Flipkart-like situation. When Flipkart, India’s e-commerce poster boy, raised $1 billion in 2014 it was considered to be a clear winner. But the company went through many rounds of fund raising, to keep pace with rival Amazon, and finally got sold to Walmart earlier this year.A lot also depends on how much the market for food delivery expands. This is a problem area at present. India is a country where people predominantly cook at home. That’s why, even after 10 years, food delivery is still restricted in around 4,000 PIN codes, while e-commerce covers about 97 per cent of 19,100 PIN codes in the country. Food delivery will be more popular in metro markets.However, some factors could help Swiggy stay ahead. Just as it it acquired 48East in December 2017 and Scootsy in August 2018, Swiggy can acquire smaller, city-specific hyper-local firms for expansion and consolidate its hold in these markets. But, that would require a lot of money, and Swiggy will have to do multiple rounds of fund-raising. Even then, it still risks meeting the same fate as Flipkart did.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/opinion/quick-take-swiggys-1billion-funding-does-not-mean-it-can-win-the-food-delivery-sweepstakes-3316741.html,Funding,"On December 20, food delivery company Swiggy raised $1 billion from existing investors Naspers, DST Global, Meituan Dianping, Coatue Management and new investors Tencent, Hillhouse and Wellington Management Company.While this round of funding values Swiggy at $3.3 billion, it may not be enough to ensure the five-year old start-up hogs the last mile to the Indian consumer’s stomach.Food delivery in India is still a top-town phenomena, and the market is overcrowded due to low-entry barriers.Swiggy has competition from other food delivery companies and even ride-hailing companies Uber and Ola have entered the market.","['Swiggy', 'Naspers', 'DST Global', 'Coatue Management', 'Hillhouse', 'Wellington Management Company', 'Swiggy', 'Swiggy']","['1billion', '$1 billion', '$3.3 billion', '1billion', '$1 billion']"
Quick Take | Why Tiger Global's return to India is good news for startups,07 December,"Tiger Global, the earliest big backer of India’s Internet story, is investing in India after a gap of about two years. Its picks: Checkmate, which integrates multiple online ordering services for restaurants, for a fee, and Facilio, a facilities management firm.Tiger’s return to India is good news because it has a knack for spotting opportunities at a very early stage, staying invested for the long term and getting the best possible returns. By backing Flipkart, it created a market for Amazon and Alibaba that fuelled online commerce in India. By backing Ola, it created the market for Uber. In a sense, it was instrumental in drawing more money into these sectors.Yes, the firm had to stop investing in India for a couple of years after it picked a series of duds in 2014 and 2015. Zo Rooms, Zopper and Localoye shut down while others such as Culture Machine, Little, Cube26 have struggled. Tiger had invested $5-10 million in each of these firms, but it couldn’t do much to change their fortunes, probably because it was focussed on Flipkart, its biggest bet in India.Now, after Walmart’s acquisition of 77 percent in Flipkart for $16 billion earlier this year, Tiger has earned $3.3 billion (after retaining a stake on 5 percent) on an investment of $1 billion. With a war chest of $3.75 billion for India and China, it is back on the prowl for early-stage start-ups.Tiger’s return cannot be more opportune for the start-up ecosystem because funding has become tough in recent times. According to a report by Bain & Co., private equity investments in India were down 22 percent in terms of value and 29 percent in terms of volume during the first six months in 2018.This time around Tiger Global is betting on the business-to-business start-ups, a departure from backing companies that are consumer-facing and primarily dependent on the internet. One reason for this could be that the company has probably realised that the internet growth story in India is slower compared to China. Secondly, there is too much competition in the e-commerce and payments space with investments from even Chinese companies like Alibaba.Both Checkmate and Facilio are in the business to business (B2B) segment. These are new business areas and firms with consumer-facing operations will need such companies to run their businesses in a cost-efficient manner.Another difference in this round of investments is that Tiger is picking up companies that are backed by technology such as artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML) and Internet of Things (IoT) and not the internet.Whether Facilio or Checkmate will become another Flipkart, only time will tell. But given Tiger’s track record of being an early investor and trend setter, Indian start-ups, especially in tech-led areas such as AI and ML, can expect a lot more investment to follow.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/opinion/quick-take-why-tiger-globals-return-to-india-is-good-news-for-startups-3263931.html,Funding,"According to a report by Bain & Co., private equity investments in India were down 22 percent in terms of value and 29 percent in terms of volume during the first six months in 2018.This time around Tiger Global is betting on the business-to-business start-ups, a departure from backing companies that are consumer-facing and primarily dependent on the internet.These are new business areas and firms with consumer-facing operations will need such companies to run their businesses in a cost-efficient manner.Another difference in this round of investments is that Tiger is picking up companies that are backed by technology such as artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML) and Internet of Things (IoT) and not the internet.Whether Facilio or Checkmate will become another Flipkart, only time will tell.","['Bain & Co.', 'AI', 'ML', 'Checkmate', 'Flipkart']","['$5-10 million', '$16 billion', '$3.3 billion', '$1 billion', '$3.75 billion']"
"Early-stage funding declines as investors look for revenue concepts, experienced founders",30 November,"Early stage investments in 2018, as at the end of October, stood at Rs 290 crore, much lower than the Rs 480 crore raised in all of 2017, as investors became cautious about putting money in start-ups that don't have a revenue concept as yet, venture debt firm Innoven Capital said in a report.The average size of deals also fell to Rs 4.4 crore from Rs 5.8 crore in 2017, the firm said in its report titled 'Early Stage Investment Insights Report 2018'.However, the number of deals struck was similar to last year -- 67 at the end of October 2018 versus 82 for all of 2017.The report, which focuses on early stage funding activity in start-ups across angel and pre-series A investments, was developed by analyzing up-to-date market information, along and surveying 14 leading institutional early-stage investors.While Bangalore and NCR continued to be the most prominent destinations for investments in start-ups, accounting for 28 percent and 25 percent, respectively, Mumbai saw a resurgence, finishing a close third at 23 percent as against a paltry 6 percent last year.Consumer, enterprise tech and artificial intelligence, healthcare and content emerged as the most active sectors.

Amazon pumps in additional Rs 230 cr in Amazon Pay,20 July,"Feeling the heat of competition in digital payments from rival camp Flipkart, Amazon is going aggressive in widening the market for its own payments platform – Amazon Pay.In its fourth investment in two years, the parent company has pumped in Rs 230 crore or $34 million into its Indian digital payments arm, according to Registrar of Companies filings sourced from data platform Paper.vc.Amazon infused fresh funds to the tune of Rs 67 crore or about $10 million in Amazon Pay first in May 2017. In the subsequent round in July the same year, Amazon had invested over Rs 130 crore or about $20 million. The latest round comes just four months after the infusion of Rs 195 crore or about $30 million in March this year.Amazon Pay’s India Head Mahendra Nerurkar had said in March this year that the company will continue to invest aggressively in its digital payments arm over the next several months. This implies that Amazon will lead several other investment rounds in Amazon Pay in this year.The aim, Nerurkar said, was to develop more local innovations to solve problems that are unique to India. For instance, Amazon has launched debit card EMIs on its platform, in association with HDFC Bank.Currently, the Amazon Pay service is used only purchases done only on the marketplace. Like Flipkart-owned PhonePe, Amazon Pay is now looking to push its wallet service beyond its marketplace to other online merchants across sectors such as grocery, fashion, automobile accessories, books, music, and entertainment among others.However, Amazon India’s renewed push on digital payments comes at a time of slowdown in the sector. Stringent KYC norms set by the Reserve Bank of India for on-boarding customers for digital wallets has added extra cost of compliance and the friction has subsequently arrested the growth of new users.As per RBI, digital wallet companies need to complete KYC verification of each customer with a transaction limit of Rs 1 lakh per month. Accounts with transaction limit of less than Rs 10,000 per month, on the other hand, can be accessed with a one-time-password verification of a mobile number and a valid government-recognized identity document.The company acknowledges the drop in new user growth due to the guidelines and says it has increased friction for digital wallets. “I don’t think we’ve found the right solution yet as an industry and we’re working very closely with the regulators to find that solution,” Nerurkar had said in an earlier interview.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/startup/amazon-pumps-in-additional-rs-230-cr-in-amazon-pay-2717831.html,Funding,"Feeling the heat of competition in digital payments from rival camp Flipkart, Amazon is going aggressive in widening the market for its own payments platform – Amazon Pay.In its fourth investment in two years, the parent company has pumped in Rs 230 crore or $34 million into its Indian digital payments arm, according to Registrar of Companies filings sourced from data platform Paper.vc.Amazon infused fresh funds to the tune of Rs 67 crore or about $10 million in Amazon Pay first in May 2017.The latest round comes just four months after the infusion of Rs 195 crore or about $30 million in March this year.Amazon Pay’s India Head Mahendra Nerurkar had said in March this year that the company will continue to invest aggressively in its digital payments arm over the next several months.","['Flipkart', 'Amazon', 'Amazon Pay', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'Amazon Pay’s']","['$34 million', 'about $10 million', 'about $20 million', 'about $30 million']"
Startups raised 80% more funds in January-March quarter as against a year ago,06 April,"The first quarter of the calendar year remained bullish for the startup ecosystem with the sector raising over USD 1.8 billion funding. This is a whopping 80 percent growth as compared to the corresponding quarter of the previous year when the sector raised USD 982 million, according to Tracxn data exclusively shared with Moneycontrol.This excludes debt and grants given to the startups and here Tracxn has taken into account all the deals upwards of USD 5 million.The development was led by big-ticket funding raised by companies such as BigBasket, Zomato and Swiggy.While BigBasket raised USD 300 million in a Series E funding round led by Alibaba Group Holding, Zomato raised USD 200 million from Ant Financial, the payments affiliate of Chinese e-commerce firm Alibaba.Swiggy on-the-other-hand raised USD 100 million from existing investor Naspers, among others. This was also the food-tech firm’s one of the biggest funding rounds so far.Lending as a sector too saw exponential traction with small and medium enterprise (SME) lending startup Lendingkart raising USD 87 million in equity financing.Much like the last year, the consumer segment attracted the majority of the capital. Across 69 rounds, consumer companies raised about USD 1 billion. During the January-March quarter of the previous year, this segment raised USD 546 million.Enterprise applications was the second largest sector in terms of funding with USD 355 million raised. Last year, the sector had raised USD 233 million.The number of funding rounds, however, reduced to 205 during January-March this year as compared to the year before which stood at 270. This signals maturing of the ecosystem with the more big-ticket investments happening.Going forward, the sector is expected to witness major developments with companies such as Flipkart, Swiggy and Zomato in talks with several players to raise huge rounds.Flipkart is in talks with a US-based retail giant to sell a majority stake even as reports of Amazon’s interest in the domestic rival circulate.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/startup/startups-raised-80-more-funds-in-january-march-quarter-as-against-a-year-ago-2544121.html,Funding,"This is a whopping 80 percent growth as compared to the corresponding quarter of the previous year when the sector raised USD 982 million, according to Tracxn data exclusively shared with Moneycontrol.This excludes debt and grants given to the startups and here Tracxn has taken into account all the deals upwards of USD 5 million.The development was led by big-ticket funding raised by companies such as BigBasket, Zomato and Swiggy.While BigBasket raised USD 300 million in a Series E funding round led by Alibaba Group Holding, Zomato raised USD 200 million from Ant Financial, the payments affiliate of Chinese e-commerce firm Alibaba.Swiggy on-the-other-hand raised USD 100 million from existing investor Naspers, among others.This was also the food-tech firm’s one of the biggest funding rounds so far.Lending as a sector too saw exponential traction with small and medium enterprise (SME) lending startup Lendingkart raising USD 87 million in equity financing.Much like the last year, the consumer segment attracted the majority of the capital.","['Tracxn', 'Moneycontrol', 'BigBasket', 'Swiggy', 'BigBasket', 'Alibaba Group Holding', 'Ant Financial', 'SME']","['USD 982 million', 'USD 5 million', 'about USD 1 billion', 'USD 546 million', 'USD 233 million']"
Cities generate barely 39 percent of funds they spend: Study,14 March,"Weak finances, both in terms of financial sustainability and financial accountability of cities is among the most important challenges that cities in India need to address. On an average, they generate only 39 percent of the funds they spend, leaving them highly dependent on state and central government grants, says the study titled Annual Survey of India’s City Systems 2017: Shaping India’s Urban Agenda by Janaagraha Centre for Citizenship and Democracy.The other challenges include lack of a modern, contemporary framework of spatial planning of cities and design standards for public utilities, poor human resource management, in terms of number of staff, skills and competencies of staff, organisation design and performance management, powerless mayors and city councils and severe fragmentation of governance across municipalities, parastatal agencies and state departments and total absence of systematic citizen participation and transparency, says the study.It must be noted that the Annual Survey of India’s City Systems (ASICS) is an objective benchmarking of 23 Indian cities across 20 states on 89 questions, covering 150 parameters, 3900 points of investigation and takes a systematic, data-driven approach towards urban governance, scoring cities on a scale of 0 to 10. It also compares Indian cities with benchmark cities such as London and New York etc.The study notes that cities presently have broken city-systems and are improving at a snail’s pace. They score between 3.0 and 5.1 while London and New York score 8.8. Johannesburg, a city from a developing country scores 7.6. Scores of benchmark cities indicate how far city-systems need to be strengthened before we can expect cities to deliver good quality of life.As for ranking of Indian cities, Pune tops the list of cities that have progressed in terms of city systems reforms with a score of 5.1, followed by Kolkata with a score of 4.6 and Thiruvananthapuram with a score of 4.6. Delhi is at number 6 with a score of 4.4, the study says.Cities lack a modern, contemporary urban planning frameworkThis may be denying citizens up to 3 per cent of GDP each year, says the report. This is primarily due to outdated town and country planning acts; weak preparation, implementation and enforcement of spatial development plans and lack of design standards for public utilitiesWell-made and well-executed Spatial Development Plans (SDP) lie at the heart of economically vibrant, equitable, environmentally sustainable and democratically engaged cities. India’s cities suffer from acute lack of planning. The report reveals that several issues across the planning PIE (Preparation, Implementation and Enforcement). Outdated town and country planning acts, a large majority of which were drafted well before India’s economic liberalisation and subsequent population growth have spawned a whole range of challenges such as urban sprawls, choked mobility networks, high carbon emissions, lack of affordable housing, rising income inequality, low economic productivity etc.India’s cities do not have design standards for roads. Roads are networks for other public utilities too-footpaths, bus stops, water and sewerage networks, storm water drains, power cables, optical fibre networks and traffic surveillance all depend on road networks. Proper design standards for roads can transform not just mobility but also other utilities, says the report.How to fix the problem? The report suggests implementing an effective system to monitor, report and penalize SDB violations. It calls for overhauling planning acts, constituting an empowered MPC anchored by elected representatives from municipalities. And at the Central level, it calls for publishing a model planning framework and design standards for  public utilities.Cities don’t generate enough funds to even cover staff salariesThey have grossly inadequate financial management systems. Financial sustainability of most municipalities is presently in a precarious position, says the study.Cities need significant amounts of capital to invest in not just creating new infrastructure and catching up on service delivery deficits, but also for revenue expenditure such as operations and maintenance and hiring of talent. On average, the cities assessed in this study, generate only 39 per cent of the funds they spend, leaving them highly dependent on state and central government grants.The study notes that for several cities, their own revenues do not even cover staff salaries. Lack of adequate own revenue sources severely constrains the ability of cities to invest in infrastructure and service delivery. However, with the abysmal standards of financial management and accountability systems existing in Indian cities today, enhancing revenues will be akin to pouring money down a leaky bucket. This is evident in the fact that no Indian city, barring Guwahati, is required to have a Medium or Long Term Fiscal Plan (MTFP/LTFP) in place. No city is required to mandatorily undertake external audit of annual accounts or internal audits.The weak state of budget management is also evident in budget variance figures (budget v/s actuals) which on average over last three years is 36 per cent across cities and as high as 75 per cent in the cities of Raipur and Ranchi, the study notes.Human resource management is the Achilles’ heel of India’s cities Municipalities do not have enough number of skilled staff required to meet infrastructure and service delivery needs of citizens. They also lack proper organisation design and have very poor human resource management policies, notes the study.Cities do not have adequate number of skilled staff. Their HR policies are outdated and HR systems and processes broken. The average staff vacancy is 35 per cent, with the highest vacancy being 60 per cent in the case of Guwahati.None of the cities has cadre and recruitment rules that contain modern job descriptions covering both technical skills and managerial competencies for each role or position in the municipality. Commissioners of cities do not possess adequate domain experience in urban management constraining their ability to deliver strongly.On average, commissioners only have 2.7 years of experience in urban management. Medium-sized cities have commissioners with 1.2 years of urban management experience, whereas large and mega cities have commissioners with 2.9 and 4.1 years respectively. Commissioners in Ludhiana, Guwahati, Dehradun, Kanpur, Ranchi, Thiruvananthapuram and Chandigarh have less than a year’s experience in urban management, notes the study.Mayor and Councillors in cities are toothlessMayors and councils in our cities don’t have full decision-making authority over critical functions and services such as planning, housing, water, environment, fire and emergency services etc. On average, only 9 out of the 18 functions under the 74th CAA have been effectively devolved. Large cities such as Bhopal, Kanpur and Lucknow have a directly elected mayor with five year tenure, compared to mega cities such as Bengaluru and Delhi which have an indirectly elected mayor with one year tenure.Mayors and councils also cannot hire and fire their own management teams, severely constraining their ability to exact accountability for performance from city officials. They have limited say when it comes to investing or borrowing monies or finalising budgets - only four cities assessed can borrow without the sanction of state governments (with a debt-limitation policy), of which one is a medium sized city and three are large cities, says the study.Only seven cities can invest without prior state government approval, of which three are large cities and four are mega cities. Only 11 out of 23 have full independence in budget-setting. Of these 11, one is a medium sized city, six are large cities and four are mega cities. All of the above have resulted in the municipality becoming a glorified service provider, far from a local self government or a city government.Parastatal agencies like the development authorities (which cover planning), water authorities or boards (that cover water and sewerage), transport corporations (that cover bus transport) report directly to state governments and to different departments/ministers within it. Exacerbating this fragmentation is the role of state departments, such as public works (roads) and police (traffic, law and order) which in many cities also have important roles to play in infrastructure and service delivery, says the study.India’s cities characterised by low levels of citizen participation and transparencyThere are no structured platforms for citizen participation (such as ward committees and area sabhas), no coherent participatory processes (such as participatory budgeting), weak citizen grievance redressal mechanisms and very low levels of transparency in finances and operations. All of this put together has resulted in weak levels of engagement between citizens and governments, as a consequence low levels of trust and in general poor quality of democracy in a city, says the study.Only 10 out of the 23 cities assessed have a Community Participation Law (CPL), a reform measure introduced under the JnNURM that mandates constitution of both ward committees and area sabhas for citizen participation. Even so, while most have constituted ward committees, only two cities, Guwahati and Hyderabad have constituted area sabhas, it notes.Citizen charters, powerful tools of accountability and grievance redressal, are missing in nine of the 23 cities assessed. Where they do exist, there is no mention of service levels, and few mention timelines for service delivery and processes for obtaining relief where service levels are not met. An ombudsman, specifically for resolving such issues, is missing in all but three Indian cities, Bhubaneswar, Ranchi and Thiruvananthapuram.To have citizens engage meaningfully, they have to be enabled with actionable information, aspect which an open data framework addresses - by not just allowing citizens to access data more easily, but also enabling civil society organisations, the media and others to aggregate and analyse information and drive advocacy efforts around specific causes. As many as 19 of the 23 Indian cities assessed are neither mandated to nor release basic yet important data sets in an open data format, it adds.Key highlights of the report:55% citizens live in cities where the mayor has a term of 2.5 years or lessOnly 13% cities have enacted town and country planning acts post liberalizationOnly 2 cities have formed both ward committees and area sabhas10 months is the average tenure of a municipal commissioner54% cities do not generate enough revenue to meet their salary costs39% is the average percentage of own revenues to total expenditure70% cities had budget variance of over 30%35% is the average staff vacancy",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/real-estate/cities-generate-barely-39-percent-of-funds-they-spend-study-2527691.html,Funding,"On an average, they generate only 39 percent of the funds they spend, leaving them highly dependent on state and central government grants, says the study titled Annual Survey of India’s City Systems 2017: Shaping India’s Urban Agenda by Janaagraha Centre for Citizenship and Democracy.The other challenges include lack of a modern, contemporary framework of spatial planning of cities and design standards for public utilities, poor human resource management, in terms of number of staff, skills and competencies of staff, organisation design and performance management, powerless mayors and city councils and severe fragmentation of governance across municipalities, parastatal agencies and state departments and total absence of systematic citizen participation and transparency, says the study.It must be noted that the Annual Survey of India’s City Systems (ASICS) is an objective benchmarking of 23 Indian cities across 20 states on 89 questions, covering 150 parameters, 3900 points of investigation and takes a systematic, data-driven approach towards urban governance, scoring cities on a scale of 0 to 10.As many as 19 of the 23 Indian cities assessed are neither mandated to nor release basic yet important data sets in an open data format, it adds.Key highlights of the report:55% citizens live in cities where the mayor has a term of 2.5 years or lessOnly 13% cities have enacted town and country planning acts post liberalizationOnly 2 cities have formed both ward committees and area sabhas10 months is the average tenure of a municipal commissioner54% cities do not generate enough revenue to meet their salary costs39% is the average percentage of own revenues to total expenditure70% cities had budget variance of over 30%35% is the average staff vacancy","['City Systems', 'Shaping India’s', 'Janaagraha Centre for Citizenship and Democracy', 'the Annual Survey of India’s City Systems', 'ASICS']","['3 per cent', 'only 39 per cent', '36 per cent', '35 per cent', '60 per cent']"

Seven tips to invest in startups as a VC fund manager,04 September,"By Sunil K GoyalThe mandate of each Fund Manager is to outperform. The safety quotient is dependent on the asset category being managed. A Venture Capitalist has a unique role versus Fund Manager of a private equity, listed equity or a debt fund. A VC has to first think of multi-bagger returns rather than the safety of capital.Here I shall share 7 tips adopted by YourNest to choose its portfolio startup companies. But first, since we have touched on the safety of capital, let me share top 3 tools adopted by VCs including ourselves to invest safely:Negotiate an attractive Liquidation Preference  This clause offers protection of VCs original investment in a startup when a liquidation event occurs. This event implies merger, acquisition or sale of a substantial part of assets of the startup. Investors negotiate for 2x or ‘1x plus participating’ liquidation preferences to protect their interests in such a scenario. At the ‘pre-series A’ investment round risks are extremely high, and hence higher liquidation preference in favour of Investors is a norm in India.Founder Vesting & Lock-in For the success of a venture it is pertinent that the founders are associated with it until the investors continue to stay invested in the start-up. VCs ensure that the founder can’t sell their shareholding until investors get an exit. VCs further protect themselves by making the founders to earn-back their original shares over an agreed period of 3-5 years. For example, if a founder quits within 12 months of an investment round, the founder shall have to give-up most of the shareholding in his or her startup.Valuation Protection VCs ensure that in case the business venture doesn't take-off as envisaged and the next investment round is at a valuation lower than the previous round, they get additional shares in the startup to protect the value of original capital invested.These tools are exercised in addition to a Board seat involving veto rights with the VC on major decisions such as changes in business strategy, investor protection, and related party transactions.Venture capital is all about investing in the future, today. It is about visualising what demographic, economic, technological trends shall emerge that shall pave way for newer business models to emerge.VCs are generally optimistic. They ascribe value to a business much ahead of revenue or profitability justifying such a valuation.To give a case study, Airtel in the year 2000 attracted VC investments led by Warburg Pincus, whereas the mutual fund managers discovered to re-rate the telecom sector & Airtel 6 years later in 2006.The valuation given by VC couldn't be justified in Airtel, by the market until the end of 2003.Once profitable, growth became a reality and the market started aligning to the telecom opportunity. We VCs have to visualize such opportunities at least 2-3 ahead of the market. Our evaluation tools are very many.Let me collate them for simplicity across top 7 criteria that YourNest uses to chose startups to invest in:Revenue potential Any startup opportunity is attractive if it is addressing larger market size. Preferably the customer pain-point be giving it an opportunity to serve a market of USD 500 million - USD 1 billion. In this large market, the start-up must demonstrate the potential of gaining significant market share at an attractive gross margin. In addition, for early stage investment, the time to sustainable & profitable revenues segment, scalability prospects, month-on-month growth prospects are also evaluated.Current customer traction At an early stage of a venture, a paid customer matters a lot. These customers must be independent and not related to the founders. The results of field pilot, demonstration of customer retention or repeat order, and the feedback from the customer on the start-up surpassing expectations ease the decision to invest. The sales pipeline for B2B startups further eases investment prospects.Differentiated value proposition– Significant value can be created by a startup if it has a sustainable entry barrier may be led by intellectual property, patents, business model or locking in customers via execution excellence.Leadership team Each fund manager should give a lot of weight to the quality of management team. This task of assessing the founding team becomes even more challenging for a VC at the early stage of a venture. Does the founding team demonstrate entrepreneurial skills of being audacious, adaptable, agile, and the ability to manage ambiguity or attract talent? Does the founding team have 3 core functional skills of a visionary cum strategist, tech cum product expert and a sales cum business development resource? For a VC, it is a non-negotiable parameter for investment consideration.Understanding of competitive landscape and the Go-To-Market StrategyEvery customer need is being fulfilled by some or the other means. There can't be a situation that we don't have any competition. Startups usually feel - we are unique! As VCs, we have to assess how its current customer need is fulfilled. Even Hotmail had a competition from physical letters by postal services. Competitive SWOT and approach to winning customers vis-a-vis global players help in assessing unique selling proposition of a startup.Return estimation What kind of returns do we expect on the invested capital? It is driven primarily by the pre-money valuation and the exit potential. What matters is - the time required to say get a 25x valuation along with the estimated time to exit and realize cash for the investment made.Is the story in place for the next fund raise? Capital in India, in particular for startups, is in scarcity. The start-up founders have to be fabulous storytellers. Their preparedness to raise next round of investment shall enable them to grow the venture manifold.The trend of venture investing largely remains constant, however, the economic cycles swing to extremes. In 2014 we experienced euphoria in investment in consumer businesses.Such cycles give rise to extraordinary investments and create new market segments. However, for past 2 years, the flow of capital to start-ups is limited.The shift is primarily towards unit economics and deeper validation of any business model.Such a swing in risk appetite is normal and actually has been offering investment opportunities at attractive valuations.For VCs, the mantra shall always be - invest in the future, enable innovation, and entrepreneurship to co-create a better future.(The author is Managing Director & Fund Manager at YourNest Venture Capital.

Online fee platform OnFees in talks for next funding round,15 May,"Cash may have been the most prevalent payment mode for educational institutions traditionally, but a push for digital economy post-demonetisation is making them change too and this has prompted three young professionals to start OnFees -- an online fee platform.Having tasted big success in Mumbai region with 35 organisations including some chains of institutions, and over 70,000 students on board in a very short span of just about 3 months, OnFees is now looking to expand to other parts of the country and is in talks for the second round of funding.While the first round of funding came from HNIs, the startup is looking for funding from established private equity and venture capital firms in India and abroad, its Chief Marketing Officer Manisha Thakur told PTI.30-year-old Manisha, an MBA in Marketing, is part of the trio that set up OnFees -- the other two being CEO Mayur Jain and Chief Technology Officer Viral Dedhiya.32-year-old Mayur is CA by education and has worked with global giant PwC for abut six years, while 31-year-old Viral is an electronics engineer.Speaking about their venture, Manisha said most of the institutes have always been collecting fees mostly in cash but the government's demonetisation move last November, announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, made the cash collection very difficult.""We saw that as an opportunity for starting an online fee platform like OnFees.com. Besides, this also takes care of another pertinent problem faced by the educational institutes -- irregular and untimely fee collection,"" she said.""We are making the entire process simpler and streamlined -- for payment of fees by the students or their parents as also for the institutions to receive the payments in a timely and hassle-free manner.""We are providing features like regular communications and notifications and are linking the existing accounting solutions of the institutions with our platform to serve the institutes better. We are in a way encouraging people to go digital,"" she added.Mayur Jain, CEO, said they are looking to expand to other parts of the country after August, and the areas to be tapped initially include Bangalore as also cities in states like Gujarat, MP and UP.""Therefore, we have decided to go for the next round of funding,"" he added.In the first round, OnFees raised Rs 2.5 crore of growth capital from HNI Hiren Gogri and his team, giving it a valuation of Rs 10 crore.“Mumbai is always a great market to test quality. Now that we have been successful in the Mumbai and Maharashtra region, we are continuing to add more institutions to our platform and the numbers would increase substantially once we start going beyond Mumbai and therefore the valuation would also see a huge jump,"" Mayur said.Asked about what kind of valuations they would look at in the second round of funding, he said that we are in talks for the next round of funding and now that we have successfully overcome the teething issues, which any start-up goes through, we should be able to get a good valuation,"" he added.Viral Dedhiya, CTO, said OnFees is also in talks with several banks for partnerships on fee payment gateways.This will help the customers of these banks to access all the facilities that OnFees has on offer, which today the banks do not provide.Some of the banks provide just the facility of fees payment which is one-way communication.What OnFees does is that it keeps the students updated on all the communications from their respective institutions.As a value add, OnFees has already tied up with HDFC Group's education loan venture Credila for education loan segment to facilitate funds to students.The startup is targeting to bring on board more than 5,000 institutions and over 60 lakh students, Viral said.Giving an example of what kind of positive changes OnFees has brought in for the institutes on its platform, Manisha said Niramala Niketan College in Mumbai, before they had OnFees integrated, was accepting DD or cash for fee payments.""It was inconvenient for everyone because fee payment was always an extra time taking job amongst many priorities like attending lectures, preparing for exams or other academic events for students.""The institute management started with OnFees to make it convenient for students and save their time, but in the process institutes also benefited by having digitised system at the back end.Fee collection was so seamless this time that institute could collect 70% fees within 2 days, and all this at no cost to the institute"" she

India needs USD 20 trillion by 2040 to boost infrastructure,13 April,"Noting that more than 70 per cent of the population will move to urban areas by 2040, Ashish Kumar Singh, the Public Works Department’s (PWD’s) principal secretary, said that “This will require investment to the tune of USD 20 trillion, to create infrastructure for this population.” Citing the example of the US, which will need nearly USD 3.6 trillion by 2020 to keep the current infrastructure going, he said India will not only have to invest in creating infrastructure but also in developing manpower capability and efficient mechanisms to maintain what has been built. “Going by the example of the US, we can only imagine the quantum of investment and skill that will be required to maintain not only the existing 90,000 kms of roadways but also the additional 13,000 kms of national highways and 10,000 kms of state highways that will be built in the next 4-5 years in Maharashtra,” Singh said, at a Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) conference on Infrastructure Project Management. Singh said the government also faces challenges in executing infrastructure projects, particularly the need for a pool of contractors who are supported by a team of skilled personnel, who can deliver world-class projects. “We need to develop manpower capability, since it is not only important to build correctly at the outset, both, in respect of design and technology, but maintenance is equally critical,” he added. See also: India could pay a hefty price of almost $1.8 trillion by 2050, for unplanned urbanisation: Study Speaking at the event, Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation’s (MIDC’s) CEO, Sanjay Sethi said, there was a need to consider the whole value chain and move towards integrated land use and transport planning, as the growth in one sector cannot preclude the other. “In this context, in integrated industrial areas under the new policy, land will be dedicated to industry (60 per cent), housing (30 per cent) and commercial development (10 per cent),” he said. Hiranandani Group’s co-founder and managing director, Niranjan Hiranandani, added that it is important not to judge timelines by historical data, as the scenario has changed from the past view of project management. “There is a paradigm shift towards finding solutions and achieving timelines, no matter what the challenges. The important point here, is to make things happen. The governments are working faster and more efficiently and the view of project management has moved from taking estimates from engineers, to simplifying and solving impediments to make it happen,” said Hiranandani.By: Housing.com/news",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/personal-finance/india-needs-usd-20-trillion-by-2040-to-boost-infrastructure-2346537.html,Funding,"Noting that more than 70 per cent of the population will move to urban areas by 2040, Ashish Kumar Singh, the Public Works Department’s (PWD’s) principal secretary, said that “This will require investment to the tune of USD 20 trillion, to create infrastructure for this population.” Citing the example of the US, which will need nearly USD 3.6 trillion by 2020 to keep the current infrastructure going, he said India will not only have to invest in creating infrastructure but also in developing manpower capability and efficient mechanisms to maintain what has been built.“Going by the example of the US, we can only imagine the quantum of investment and skill that will be required to maintain not only the existing 90,000 kms of roadways but also the additional 13,000 kms of national highways and 10,000 kms of state highways that will be built in the next 4-5 years in Maharashtra,” Singh said, at a Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) conference on Infrastructure Project Management.","['the Public Works Department’s', 'PWD', 'Maharashtra', 'Confederation of Indian Industry', 'Infrastructure Project Management']","['USD 20 trillion', 'almost $1.8 trillion', '60 per cent', '30 per cent', '10 per cent']"
"Flipkart buys eBay India business, gets $500 million as investment",10 April,"Touted as the largest ever fund raise in the Indian startup ecosystem, e-commerce major Flipkart on Monday raised USD 1.4 billion from Tencent, eBay and Microsoft at post transaction valuation of USD 11.6 billion.In exchange for an equity stake in Flipkart, eBay is making a cash investment of USD 500 million and selling its India business to the company.Even as eBay has sold its India business Flipkart, not all of its employees in India will be absorbed by the Bangalore-based company.""There will be a section of employees who will continue with eBay India – primarily in the India analytics team based in Bengaluru and will continue to support global work for eBay. There will another section of employees who will relocate to eBay US,"" said the spokesperson of eBay India over an e-mail.While the company did not disclose the India-specific numbers, globally it claims to be having 11,000 employees across 39 countries.According to the company's spokesperson, a part of employees will move to Flipkart at the closure of the deal which will take approximately 60-90 days. While another chunk of employees who will continue to support the transition will take further more time to move to Flipkart. There will be no retrenchment as part of the deal, an eBay India spokesperson said.The valuation of Flipkart fell to USD 11.6 billion during the current round, 23.6 percent down from its previous round in July of 2015. Flipkart had raised USD 700 million at a valuation of over USD 15 million then.Upon the close of the transaction, which is expected later this year, Flipkart will acquire eBay’s buyers in India. The company will remove the number of active buyers in India from its reporting during the quarter in which the transaction closes.The US-based had entered into the India market, through an acquisition of Baazee.com in 2004. It finally launched its e-commerce business in India in 2005.However, despite having an early mover advantage, the company couldn't make it big in the India market and eventually succumbed to competition from much younger rivals including Flipkart.Lack of a differentiated vision for the India market against its global markets was touted to be one of the biggest reason for the failure of eBay in India.It started off as a trading platform offering auctions, quick buys and classifieds modes of person-to-person trading. One could sell gems and jewellery, handicrafts, clothes, even used electronics on the site.Auctioning was a popular method of buying products in the US and was seen a good method for price discovery.India, however, was a very different market. A thing like auction wouldn't quite match the requirement of the customers here.Furthermore, former employees have also accused the company of not giving them a free hand when it came to experimenting with initiatives.""All software development had to happen from San Jose.

The devaluation also indicates Indian e-commerce companies have lost sheen with investors as they struggle to hit a path to profitability, even as Amazon keep on investing billions in India.Flipkart’s latest investment adds to an existing group of investors that include Tiger Global Management, Naspers Group, Accel Partners and DST Global.“This is a landmark deal for Flipkart and for India as it endorses our tech prowess, our innovative mindset and the potential we have to disrupt traditional markets.

"Banks‘ share of funding to real estate sector, shrinks to 24% in 5 years",06 April,"The share of banks’ credit in the real estate sector, has shrunk drastically in the last few years, from 50%-57% in 2010 to 24%-26% in 2016, said Knight Frank India, in its first edition of its capital markets report titled ‘Analysis of Institutional Funding in Real Estate’. Nevertheless, the total funding in the Indian real estate sector increased by 40%, from USD 3.8 billion in 2011 to USD 5.4 billion in 2016. “Rising NPAs, higher risk provisioning and mounting losses in the real estate industry, have led to reduction in credit offered by banks,” the report said. The vacuum created by banks has been filled by private equity (PE). “Around three-fourths of the real estate sector’s funding requirement has been met by PE players in the past couple of years, as against one-fourth in 2010,” the report said. 2015 witnessed the highest amount of PE fund flow into the sector since 2010, with more than USD 3.6 billion investments across 100 plus deals. However, in 2016 the report observed a 13% drop in PE fund flow, with less than 60 deals in the previous year but recorded the highest amount of the average deal size, amounting to USD 56 million. “Shortages in quality retail space and increasing rental values, have attracted PE players towards the retail segment in the last two years,” Knight Frank said in a statement. “As the real estate market in India matures, driven by regulatory and market forces, we expect PE capital to play an even greater role. Creation of public markets for commercial assets in the form of REITs and sale of distressed assets by banks to reduce NPAs, are some of the drivers that would attract a lot of foreign capital into the Indian real estate market,” Knight Frank India’s ED and head (capital markets), Rajeev Bairathi said.By: Housing.com/news",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/personal-finance/banksâ€™-sharefunding-to-real-estate-sector-shrinks-to-245-years-2346851.html,Funding,"The share of banks’ credit in the real estate sector, has shrunk drastically in the last few years, from 50%-57% in 2010 to 24%-26% in 2016, said Knight Frank India, in its first edition of its capital markets report titled ‘Analysis of Institutional Funding in Real Estate’.Creation of public markets for commercial assets in the form of REITs and sale of distressed assets by banks to reduce NPAs, are some of the drivers that would attract a lot of foreign capital into the Indian real estate market,” Knight Frank India’s ED and head (capital markets), Rajeev Bairathi said.By: Housing.com/news",['Knight Frank India’s'],"['USD 3.8 billion', 'USD 5.4 billion', 'USD 56 million']"
India's startup ecosystem in a correction mode: Trifecta Capital,04 April,"Venture debt firm Trifecta Capital plans to invest across 15-20 startups during the current year with the deal size ranging from Rs 5 to 45 crore according to a top executive of the company.""We have made 18 investments in the last 15 months. Of the 18, we have committed about Rs 275 crore. We have already started to get returns. We would like to keep up the pace to at least 15-20 startups this year,"" Rahul Khanna, founder and managing director of Trifecta Capital told Moneycontrol.com.Venture debt funds have gained importance in the last couple of years with most of the startups raising funds to usually meet specified operational targets unlike a venture capital or equity fund which is mostly raised to prepare a war chest and to meet long-term goals.""People have started to appreciate the cost of debt versus equity,"" said Khanna.In India, venture debt firms usually offer debts at 15-18 percent interest rates.These debts help a company to minimise dilution. As compared to a VC only funding round, the founders get to keep a higher share when they combine the round with a debt fund.Big Basket is not the only big name in the startup ecosystem to have raised fund from venture debt firm. The company follows firms such as Paper Boat, Urban Ladder, Practo, Myntra, Snapdeal and Oyo which have raised money from venture debt funds such as Trifecta and Innoven Capital.(Funding given by Trifecta | Source: Tracxn)According to Trifecta, a lot of their investors have been able to double their allocations since venture debt is a high yield medium. Khanna, however, declined to share specific details.The company has investments from banks, insurance firms and family offices.Debt funds move to fill in gap created by VC firmsLike many other funds, Trifecta too works on a cap based module.""The caps have been constructed with a risk management standpoint ... we cannot deploy more than 10 percent of our committed capital, into any one company. We also have caps on who are the equity investors...so we can only have as much capital at risk with an equity investor. We also have sectoral caps,"" said Khanna who has funded startups across consumer internet, enterprise software and technology sectors among others.Incidentally, the rise of venture debt has started to happen at a point when the growth of venture capital funding in the startup sector has declined.In January 2017, barely USD 173 million worth of venture capital investments took place in Indian startups compared to over twice that number in the same period, a year ago. The reduced investments by VC funds makes it India an attractive market for venture debt firms.Over 60 percent of startups surveyed by venture debt fund Innoven India in its latest India Startup Outlook Report 2017 said they had an unfavourable funding experience 2016, with half of them not being able to raise funds finally.In the last one year, the startup sector has witnessed a lot of developments including layoffs at the country's third largest e-commerce firm Snapdeal, a massive decline in the funding scenario and hundreds of startups shutting shops citing funding pressure.Unlike 2015 which saw investors pouring money across multiple startups, the last 15 months have been highly cautious.""In a lot of ways what people were trying to look for was behaviour change which is the hardest change to make happen. Imagine ten years ago there was no Ola, Uber or Flipkart...many of these brands did not exist...you cannot imagine your daily life without them now... somebody had to subsidise their market creation,"" Khanna said justifying the move of VC firms who poured in millions of dollars in India.""In a lot of ways this was done by investors...they subsidised the cost of market creation...we benefited a lot because we have a generation of consumers which are now digitally savvy. We have to make sure that we do not throw baby along with the bathwater...,"" he added.Talking about the layoffs, Khanna said that people went through similar waves in Silicon Valley from 1999 to 2001.""The truth is, when a company gets funded, they hire people in a hurry. In some cases companies end up paying them more than they should have paid,"" he said.According to Khanna, there also has been a misalignment of incentives as people were paid a premium to join startups unlike many other parts of the world, where they take a pay cut because they think they will make more money through equity and ESOPs.He said that hiring indiscriminately and paying more than market salaries created a huge fixed cost problem for startups. ""What kills companies is the fixed cost...if you cannot manage that, that becomes a problem,"" he said.priyanka.sahay@nw18.com",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/startup/indias-startup-ecosystem-is-in-a-correction-mode-trifecta-capital-2252287.html,Funding,"We would like to keep up the pace to at least 15-20 startups this year,"" Rahul Khanna, founder and managing director of Trifecta Capital told Moneycontrol.com.Venture debt funds have gained importance in the last couple of years with most of the startups raising funds to usually meet specified operational targets unlike a venture capital or equity fund which is mostly raised to prepare a war chest and to meet long-term goals.The reduced investments by VC funds makes it India an attractive market for venture debt firms.Over 60 percent of startups surveyed by venture debt fund Innoven India in its latest India Startup Outlook Report 2017 said they had an unfavourable funding experience 2016, with half of them not being able to raise funds finally.In the last one year, the startup sector has witnessed a lot of developments including layoffs at the country's third largest e-commerce firm Snapdeal, a massive decline in the funding scenario and hundreds of startups shutting shops citing funding pressure.Unlike 2015 which saw investors pouring money across multiple startups, the last 15 months have been highly cautious.","['Trifecta Capital', 'Moneycontrol.com', 'Venture', 'VC', 'Innoven India', 'India Startup Outlook Report', 'Snapdeal']",['millions of dollars']

Startup lessons: How to enter foreign markets and deal with bribery,15 March,"The CEO of a small tech startup from India is sitting opposite table with the head of a Malaysian trade association, with which he is trying to forge a deal.The client is essential for the sustainability of the startup’s revenues. The CEO has spent days in Malaysia being the only sales guy from the 8-member startup based in India.The association head asks for a bribe straight away. He said it could be delivered to him through his man in India. The CEO refuses.Here are few lessons that the startup CEO told me on condition of anonymity which could be useful for other businesses planning to expand their horizons:Lesson 1: Don't stoop on values“If you cut a deal with a greedy person, he would leave your company mid way, often with someone who can offer him a better deal,” the CEO said.He also reminded on Lesson number 2 of deal making - always know a well networked person and middle management just in case the number one boss turns against your deal. He won the deal later with honest persuasion to the board.Lesson 2: Dress localAlways wear a local dress and smell local. This CEO always wears a Batik shirt when going for official meetings in a city like Jakarta. Even though he cannot speak Bahasa, he tries to break the ice by talking about the weather, a local restaurant or local food.Businesses are much more accepting of better and honest deals from foreign businessmen than dishonest locals.Lesson 3:  Pre-empt problems Always talk about the problem the prospect is facing and focus on possible solutions to it.If you have not captured the imagination of a prospect in first three slides, you have lost the game. Be succinct and try to capture the problems of your prospect and talk about it in the first few slides than beat about the bush.For overcoming regulations, a local partner is essential.Zomato CEO Deepinder Goyal once said he goes to the extent of registering companies in markets where he does not even plan to open up business in next six months.It’s called ‘a state of readiness. Rather than wasting time overcoming regulations, it’s best to pre-empt and overcome legal hurdles in markets you are sure, your business will enter one day.Lesson 4: Remote managementSeveral startups just hire a consultant from India who looks for a local liaison officer in such markets. Once that hire is confirmed - all sales including tele calls are managed from India.Many online companies have expanded their base into markets such as SouthEast Asia, Asia Pacific and Latin America through this way.Often when a product is launched in a local market, all an online company does is manage the customer service and sales in a remote fashion. For cloud based software products, it becomes really easy to replicate such templates in a local market.For a product such as Uber, one has to have local ground presence for support including regular onboarding and local marketing efforts.Lesson 5: Team CollaborationOnce you have a global team spread across various geographies, it becomes super important to have daily collaboration through online tools such as Slack, Workplace or Flock.It is also important to fly down teams into one geo-location for a face to face meeting once every quarter to help build up team camaraderie.harsimran.julka@nw18.com",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/opinion/startup-lessons-how-to-enter-foreign-marketsdealbribery-1034707.html,Funding,"The CEO refuses.Here are few lessons that the startup CEO told me on condition of anonymity which could be useful for other businesses planning to expand their horizons:Lesson 1: Don't stoop on values“If you cut a deal with a greedy person, he would leave your company mid way, often with someone who can offer him a better deal,” the CEO said.He also reminded on Lesson number 2 of deal making - always know a well networked person and middle management just in case the number one boss turns against your deal.Even though he cannot speak Bahasa, he tries to break the ice by talking about the weather, a local restaurant or local food.Businesses are much more accepting of better and honest deals from foreign businessmen than dishonest locals.Lesson 3:  Pre-empt problems Always talk about the problem the prospect is facing and focus on possible solutions to it.If you have not captured the imagination of a prospect in first three slides, you have lost the game.",['values“If'],[]

In comparison, the number stood at USD 453.19 million across a similar number of deals during the year ago period.The decline can be attributed to a wait and watch approach adopted by VCs and Private Equity funds as consumer internet startups have suffered a decline in demand post demonetisation.Investors seem to be shying away from the heavily funded ecommerce and hyperlocal sectors.

Bangalore-based Practo alone raised USD 55 million funding from new and existing investors such as China’s Tencent Holdings, Sequoia Capital and Matrix Partners, among others.Overall, besides a couple of big ticket investments, most of the deals were scattered across smaller deal sizes in angel and Series A rounds.As compared to December 2016, January saw more number of deals but the total amount funded remained lower.

"PE investment in RE increases 22 pc y-o-y, in Jan-Sept 2016",04 November,"Private equity investment in the real estate sector, has grown 22 per cent during January-September this year, to Rs 28,300 crores, from Rs 23,200 crores a year ago, reflecting improved confidence among investors to make larger investments, says a Cushman & Wakefield report.According to the report, private equity inflow increased to Rs 28,300 crores during the period, out of which nearly Rs 9,200 crores were recorded during the third quarter (July-September) of 2016. While the number of deals closed during the third quarter moderately declined by 3 per cent quarter-on-quarter (q-o-q), to 32 per cent, the total investments increased by 1.2 per cent, reflecting increased confidence among investors to make larger investments.The average deal size, therefore, increased from Rs 275 crores in Q2 2016 to Rs 287 crores in the third quarter of 2016. ‘Owing to the continued interest in pre-leased office assets, the investments in the commercial office assets have already surpassed the total investment received during the calendar year 2015,’ the report said. The y-o-y change in investment in office assets, has recorded an increase by over 50 per cent, as registered in the third quarter. ‘Moreover with a few large deals for office portfolios in active discussion and deal closure stages, the fourth quarter (October-December 2016) is expected to record the highest annual investments made in the asset class’, the report stated.Residential assets witnessed over 73 per cent or Rs 6,675 crores of the total investment during July-September 2016. ‘Despite the largest share in total volumes, investments saw a moderate 3 per cent decline when compared to those received in the same period in 2015’, according to the report. Within residential investments:Mumbai was the most preferred location that accounted for 63 per cent of the share. Delhi-NCR accounted for 18 per cent of the share. Bengaluru accounted for 15 per cent of the share.‘Domestic funds were the most active investors in residential assets and accounted for 82 per cent of the total investments made in the asset class. The cumulative investments in the residential assets increased 9 per cent q-o-q, in the third quarter of 2016,’ the report noted. Anticipating a revival in the sector and given the potential to list under the Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT), retail assets are attracting large investments from various funds. Therefore, the year-to-date investments in retail assets during 2016, increased almost threefold to Rs 3,800 crores, over Rs 1,020 crores noted during the same period of 2015.Anshul Jain, managing director, India, Cushman & Wakefield, explained that “There has been a steady shift in ownership of assets, especially office, from being privately held to institutionally held, moving in line with the global trends. This will further assist the Indian market to attract more and more investments in the sector. It also opens doors to the successful implementation of REITs in India.”He further added that given how investible assets are fewer, one may see a moderate slowdown in investment in office assets in 2017, albeit end of 2016 is still looking strong and promising. “Even while residential asset classes continued to attract the highest volume, it will continue to be dogged with challenges of end-user purchases, which has led to a decline in the number of launches in the segment. Retail, which saw an increase in interest from investors, should also be viewed with some caution as the investments have been made in fully-leased successfully operating assets,” he pointed out. While this trend could see a few more commitments in the next 12-24 months ahead, this will not be the rising trends or be a salvage situation for ailing retail properties, he added.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/personal-finance/pe-investmentre-increases-22-pc-y-o-yjan-sept-2016-951247.html,Funding,"Private equity investment in the real estate sector, has grown 22 per cent during January-September this year, to Rs 28,300 crores, from Rs 23,200 crores a year ago, reflecting improved confidence among investors to make larger investments, says a Cushman & Wakefield report.According to the report, private equity inflow increased to Rs 28,300 crores during the period, out of which nearly Rs 9,200 crores were recorded during the third quarter (July-September) of 2016.While the number of deals closed during the third quarter moderately declined by 3 per cent quarter-on-quarter (q-o-q), to 32 per cent, the total investments increased by 1.2 per cent, reflecting increased confidence among investors to make larger investments.The average deal size, therefore, increased from Rs 275 crores in Q2 2016 to Rs 287 crores in the third quarter of 2016.",['Cushman & Wakefield'],"['22 per cent', '3 per cent', '32 per cent', '1.2 per cent', 'over 50 per cent', '63 per cent', '18 per cent', '15 per cent', '82 per cent', '9 per cent']"
Why investors are still necessary for the real estate sector,03 November,"Although not many developers may be willing to publicly admit it, the fact is that developers find it advantageous to have investors as anchors for their projects. Developers need money, even before they can commence a project, to buy land and often, only the investors will give them money at that early stage, without any collateral or receivable.“Approvals can take any amount of time but not less than one year. During that phase, nobody is going to stand by you, except the investor,” says a candid Sunny Bijlani, director of Supreme Universal, on the advantages of having investors to anchor a project.“Even banks will not fund you. All the organised funding starts, only when you have something ready to offer to them. However, developers cannot keep waiting till a project gets approved, to launch it; you need some quasi-investment at each stage,” he explains.In this scenario, there are two models in real estate investment. The first, involves a pre-launch with funding only from investors and a minimum amount of understanding as to what kind of a project it would shape up to be, in the future. The second kind of pre-launch is crowdfunding, where there is better clarity on the project’s details. In this case, the developer has the plans for the project (including layouts, floor plans and unit plans) ready but does not have sanctions. Consequently, this is a mass pre-launch and does not depend only on a select set of investors. Although laws do not allow such opaque transactions, it is an open secret in the Indian property market and akin to an IPO model. The advantage for developers, is that the price point here, is higher than the price point at which they offer it to the select set of investors.According to Devang Trivedi, managing director of the Progressive Group, unlike end-users, investors are not problematic as they do not ask too many questions. Even if there are some escalation charges, it is easy to deal with one investor than 15 or 20 other people who will keep fighting. So, an investor is an easier person to deal with, once he comes in, he justifies.“Developers have to brave various odds – courts, ministries, municipalities, local factors, environment and market forces. Under these circumstances, an investor is an asset for the developer. Even when an investor exits, in many cases, he does not sell it to the end-users but sells it back to the developer, who buys it at a thousand-odd rupees cheaper than the price at which the developer will sell to the end-user,” points out Trivedi.(The writer is CEO, Track2Realty)",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/personal-finance/why-investorsstill-necessary-forreal-estate-sector-952100.html,Funding,"The advantage for developers, is that the price point here, is higher than the price point at which they offer it to the select set of investors.According to Devang Trivedi, managing director of the Progressive Group, unlike end-users, investors are not problematic as they do not ask too many questions.Even when an investor exits, in many cases, he does not sell it to the end-users but sells it back to the developer, who buys it at a thousand-odd rupees cheaper than the price at which the developer will sell to the end-user,” points out Trivedi.","['the Progressive Group', 'Trivedi']",[]

Why the next few months are critical for Ola's survival,13 October,"Moneycontrol BureauIn the world of startups, the first mover advantage proves to be of little significance over a long period.Amazon has matched up to Flipkart despite entering India about 5 years later. Uber is giving a tough fight to Ola for survival, despite the latter having a three-year launch advantage over its American rival.It was the summer of 2012, I met the upbeat Ola management for the first time in a Bangalore coffee shop after they had raised about USD 5 million from Tiger Global Management. Ola was going all guns blazing and Uber was still unheard of in India.The only rival it encountered was Bangalore-based Taxi For Sure. Uber was launched in August 2013, starting with a pilot in Bangalore.Since 2012, Ola has expanded it almost 102 cities and Uber to 28 Indian cities. Ola raised over USD 1.2 billion in the last few years, while Uber has already invested over USD 1 billion in its Indian subsidiary and plans to invest another USD 1 billion in to it.A big funding round is critical for OlaFor Ola, which raised USD 500 million from Softbank in November of 2015, a big funding round has become critical to fight Uber, which is rapidly expanding its India operations.Uber, which had under 100,000 drivers on its platform till last year, has already quadrupled them. Ola claims to have about 450,000 vehicles which also includes auto-rickshaws. The American startup is slowly inching past Ola and threatens to beat it in.Uber sold its operations in China to Didi Chuxing, this year and plans to divert all its might and muscle to fight Softbank-funded Ola in India, its other biggest market in Asia.Most Indian taxi drivers you would talk to, keep two phones now – one for Ola, another for Uber. The problems in Ola’s system, they say, is the cash settlement every few days. Often they don’t end up getting their required dues, more than two of them have complained to me in the past, making them shift to rival Uber.A lot of Ola’s claimed driver fleet is rumoured to be inactive – which simply means they enrolled once – however don’t accept rides on it any further.It’s for this reason that for Ola, the next few months will be critical. More funding will be needed to on-board drivers, spend on marketing as well as offer and match cash incentives which Uber is offering its drivers.Uber which is already gaining an advantage over its Indian rival in bigger cities.Revenues from one big metro for a taxi-aggregator startup can be equal to domination in half a dozen tier-2 cities where distance and traffic is lesser and cab rides are mostly used for transfer to and fro railway stations.Of course, tourist and temple towns see higher adoption rate, though they cannot match an average trip charge in a Mumbai, Bangalore or Delhi.Ola has lagged behind Uber in quality, service and even incentives for drivers. While the latter depends directly upon funding received, the former two parameters for Ola depend upon lack of quality control and technology to control fraud by drivers.As per a Times of India report, Ola co-founder Bhavish Aggarwal has been in talks with General Motors which has invested in Uber’s rival Lyft. However, things are yet to come to a fruition.A delay in funding will only make Uber expand its territory in newer cities where Ola has pre-captured the market. And a potential opportunity for an Indian startup to make a dent in the local startup ecosystem.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/startup/whynext-few-monthscritical-for-olas-survival-957351.html,Funding,"Ola raised over USD 1.2 billion in the last few years, while Uber has already invested over USD 1 billion in its Indian subsidiary and plans to invest another USD 1 billion in to it.A big funding round is critical for OlaFor Ola, which raised USD 500 million from Softbank in November of 2015, a big funding round has become critical to fight Uber, which is rapidly expanding its India operations.Uber, which had under 100,000 drivers on its platform till last year, has already quadrupled them.More funding will be needed to on-board drivers, spend on marketing as well as offer and match cash incentives which Uber is offering its drivers.Uber which is already gaining an advantage over its Indian rival in bigger cities.Revenues from one big metro for a taxi-aggregator startup can be equal to domination in half a dozen tier-2 cities where distance and traffic is lesser and cab rides are mostly used for transfer to and fro railway stations.Of course, tourist and temple towns see higher adoption rate, though they cannot match an average trip charge in a Mumbai, Bangalore or Delhi.Ola has lagged behind Uber in quality, service and even incentives for drivers.","['OlaFor Ola', 'Softbank', 'Uber']","['about USD 5 million', 'USD 500 million']"

5 trends that will reshape the Indian real estate market,16 September,"1. Co-working spaces finding favour with independent consultants, freelancers With the growing start-up ecosystem across India and the central government creating an enabling environment for entrepreneurship, demand for office spaces matching such firms’ requirements has gone up, in the last few years. Also, due to the rising number of freelance professionals or consultants in today’s globalised workforce, office communities or co-working spaces are gaining popularity across Indian metros and tier-2 cities. These spaces offer desks at cheaper rentals and some also allow a rent-free period to tenants, apart from utilities and an office-like feel to potential start-ups. Some of the co-working places, also work as incubation centres for the urban centres they are based out of. Interestingly, start-ups are also buying/ leasing real estate, to sub-lease it to such tenants. Roughly, over a 100 such players are already active across India. 2. Crowdfunding beginning to take hold Crowdfunding involves raising small amounts of money online, from many people across the globe, to finance a project or venture. While other industries have seen the emergence of a more dynamic crowdfunding scene, real estate’s popularity still has a lot of catching up to do. Although it is in a nascent stage in India, crowdfunding can pick up, because the financials of many developers are stretched. With increased digitisation and transparency, investors can be expected to open up to this way of investing, if they can expect good returns. Already, non-resident Indians can invest in the country’s real estate market, under the same conditions applicable to residents. Moreover, a marketplace is already bringing together real estate investors, as also listing premium plots, apartments and villas. This sector is likely to evolve and grow in the coming years. 3. Greater transparency to attract more funding Two-thirds of the real estate markets, globally, have shown progress in their levels of transparency over the past two years, according to JLL’s Global Real Estate Transparency Index (GRETI) 2016. India also made improvements in overall transparency scores, by moving up four places and its tier-1 cities are expected to break into the transparent category in the 2018 rankings. Out of 109 countries, the top 10 highly-transparent markets alone corner 75% of global investment into commercial real estate (CRE), highlighting the extent to which transparency drives real estate investment decisions. Capital allocations in excess of US $1 trillion, will be targeting CRE within the next decade, compared to US$700 billion now. This growth means investors will continue to demand further improvements in real estate transparency. There’s also mounting pressure from the world’s growing middle classes, to weed out corruption from real estate, while social media will also help to improve transparency. 4. Retailers looking favourably at office-retail complexes For quite some time now, retailers have been roadblocked by a lack of available quality retail space. At such a time, office-retail complexes (ORCs) are emerging as alternatives to high streets and malls, for some categories of retailers, such as F&B (quick service restaurants, coffee shops, fine dining, pubs, etc.) or BFSI (bank branches, ATMs, broking services, etc.). See also: Commercial and office demand determine residential realty trends As most part of a working individual’s day, is spent at the office, retail services benefit immensely by locating themselves close to business districts. Retail categories, such as telecom services, office formals, leather bags and accessories, high-end fitness centres, premium salons, eyewear and mobile manufacturers, are now all looking favourably at ORCs. Of the total retail presence in office buildings across major tier-1 cities, a dominant 26% is occupied by F&B and 23% is occupied by retail BFSI outlets. While retailers get the dual advantage, of paying lower rents compared to premium spaces in grade-A malls and closer access to their main target segment of office-goers, developers are also open to experimenting more with a mixed-use format. This way, they can build retail spaces on the lower floors and commercial spaces on the upper floors. 5. Technology is transforming real estate requirements across the globe Tech-enabled workplaces are becoming more common across the globe. In the United States, research on the budgets of clients’ interior build-outs are showing very interesting results, with IT costs as a proportion of overall construction budgets increasing rapidly. Over the last decade, this cost was around 5% of the overall construction budget. Now, IT services have expanded from mere cabling and wiring, to include access devices, infrastructure, mobility, connectivity, data security systems, wireless connections, business-specific apps, company-specific conferencing and presentation capabilities. All of these items can add up to 35% or more of the budget, for a truly technology-focused company. This theme is seen in every tenant build-out today, from traditional law firms to new campuses built by companies like Facebook and Apple. The aesthetics and prestige of an office, are beginning to take a back seat to technology and connectivity.

Challenges faced by women entrepreneurs to raise funding,19 May,"Entrepreneurship was once considered a man’s territory, but with each passing year women are taking the plunge and leading their own enterprises. This however, does not come without its own challenges. As we already know, raising funds from an investor is a tough task for any business owner. However, on many fronts, the task gets even more challenging if you are a woman trying to generate funds for your business.A lot of women entrepreneurs face huge challenges in raising funds. Some key learnings I have had from my experience:1. Sector : Most women led businesses are not in the “typical” sectors that seek funding from external sources, eg. Tech based businesses. This implies that both the degree of visibility of women led businesses in the market and their viability/feasibility in the eyes of VCs is automatically reduced. 2. Banks/Loans not available: Banks while claiming to have loans for women, always ask for some collateral, or give loans to profitable businesses only. This negates the idea of the loan completely, making it difficult to raise amounts from this channel as well. Research shows that the loan approval rates for women are 15-20% lesser than that of men (cited from Bizz2credit), a disappointing statistic in the era of breaking the glass ceiling and women empowerment.3.The Family story: At every VC meeting that I have had, the question of how many children do you have, who manages the children, what does the husband do, what family support exists, have been subtly, but surely asked. Despite the fact that these questions are in no way indicative of one’s capabilities as an entrepreneur, they have continuously surfaced. The inevitable idea that a woman cannot prioritise her business like man does, seems to be the trend. This is a huge challenge to overcome.4. VCs fund their own: The trend has always been for VCs to fund people from their tribe. Typical example being the IIT/IIM legacy we always hear about. If there were more women partners in the VC firms, the likelihood of their understanding and funding women led businesses would be a great deal more, making it easier for the women entrepreneurs. The staggering gender gap, in terms of employment in VC firms, sadly, translates into lesser women receiving funding opportunities today.A lot will need to change if we want women to get equal opportunities as men for funding and it will have to start with mindsets. The mindsets here need to go beyond the gender equality cliché. We need mentors who understand their working and give them the right support, as at the end of the day we should not forget that this would contribute to the overall growth of the country's economy. In light of this statement, it is imperative that the role of women in business and entrepreneurship is scrutinized with an objective eye; focusing on their actual contributions to various sectors, and also examining the causes behind their innumerable lost opportunities.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/startup/challenges-faced-by-women-entrepreneurs-to-raise-funding-998314.html,Funding,"Research shows that the loan approval rates for women are 15-20% lesser than that of men (cited from Bizz2credit), a disappointing statistic in the era of breaking the glass ceiling and women empowerment.3.The Family story: At every VC meeting that I have had, the question of how many children do you have, who manages the children, what does the husband do, what family support exists, have been subtly, but surely asked.We need mentors who understand their working and give them the right support, as at the end of the day we should not forget that this would contribute to the overall growth of the country's economy.",[],[]

How to get a loan for self-construction of home,11 December,"Sukanya KumarRetailLending.comOwn a piece of land? But not having funds to construct your dream-home on it? Why don't you plan to get it financed? Seems to be a good idea, right? Great. But you must learn the nuances before you apply and do not 'discover' it in the process.Here are some tips for getting a loan for construction of home on a self-owned land:1. The ownership ~The ownership, i.e., who all are the title holder of the land is of utmost importance. The land could have been acquired by purchase from a developer, or an independent land-owner or could have been inherited from ancestors. (a) The land, if purchased from a developer and is in a gated community with basic facilities already developed like electricity and water connection, leveling of ground, roads laid, proper earmarking etc., then the funding is easy than that of an independent parcel of land. Lenders prefer gated community.(b) A solitaire parcel of land should have all statutory clearances from government and local town-planning authority and should also not be an agricultural or commercial in nature. The land should not be in green zone. If so, funding will not be possible under standard home loan criteria.(c) A land which is inherited can have various issues like joint holding with siblings which may not be acceptable by lenders, such as with married sisters or brother who is abroad and do not wish to come into the loan etc. You must check this out before planning up.(d) Land owned by trust, educational institutions, temple, church etc. will have conditions attached and no lender will be interested in funding with clauses.2. The LTV (loan to value) ratio ~ If the land has no loans, then the construction funding can be as high as 100%. The banks have methodology of calculating the loan amount considering the market value of the land. They accept the land-value as self-contribution for the financing.3. Tranche' funding ~ Do remember that the financing will be done in tranches. That means once you complete, say 25% of the construction, a 25% of the loan amount will be released. If the amount released is in advance (in case of full funding), upon a valuation expert's report that the disbursed sum has been utilised towards construction and the progress is satisfactory, only then the next tranche' will be disbursed.4. Requisite documents ~ Sanctioned plan from the city corporation or the relevant town-planning authority will be a must. An estimate by the contractor will have to be submitted too on the architect's letterhead. The tax payment on the land will have to be up-to-date.5. What is not funded ~ Extravagant estimates will not be funded. For example, on a piece of land which costs Rs 30 Lakh, an estimate of Rs 3 crore will be frowned at. To justify the Rs 3 crore cost, even if superior quality of fixtures are shown, the lender may not agree to release high amount of funds on a low-cost land. So, be reasonable while making the estimate.6. Funds disbursal ~ The funds are disbursed at the personal account of the landowner-cum-borrower. In cases where the land is in father's name and the son's income is considered for the loan, the funds will be disbursed to the person's account whose account will be debited towards EMI payments; in this example it will be the son's.7. Relationship grid on property holding ~ There are some acceptable relationship within which if the property is held, can only be funded by the lenders. These are generally between parents/in-laws, spouse and children of age above 18. Some lenders are flexible and willing to fund to siblings like two brothers having income and both willing to come to the loan agreement. Properties jointly held with cousins, friends, colleagues or distant relatives are not acceptable for funding at all.8. Minor land-owner ~ If there's a minor in the ownership of the land, then banks do not want to fund. They seek a court-order which is required to mortgage the share of a minor as he/she is not capable of understanding the matter. This is most difficult to get from court and may take many years. It is best to avoid planning up a bank-finance, if you have a minor co-owner in the property, even if it is within acceptable relationship grid, as explained earlier.Notes ~ Self-construction loan processing is easy on the sanctioned bit and very lengthy in the part-disbursement side. You need to have patience while it is in process and it is recommended to have a deep pocket, in case the funds do get released a bit later than your expected date. There are external agencies like valuation companies involved in the process and the bank is dependent on the reports they submit. Hope the above helps you decide on constructing your own bungalow sooner than you thought.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/personal-finance/how-to-getloan-for-self-constructionhome-1473367.html,Funding,"If the amount released is in advance (in case of full funding), upon a valuation expert's report that the disbursed sum has been utilised towards construction and the progress is satisfactory, only then the next tranche' will be disbursed.4.In cases where the land is in father's name and the son's income is considered for the loan, the funds will be disbursed to the person's account whose account will be debited towards EMI payments; in this example it will be the son's.7.",['EMI'],[]
How to borrow large sum despite low net take home income,01 December,"Sukanya KumarRetailLending.comAlmost all the times we find lenders doing loan on basis of your actual net income, which is the safest option. However, given the high levels of cash transactions in many businesses, it becomes a bit difficult for many businessmen and professionals to report high net income regularly. Low net income does not necessarily mean that such businessmen are bad borrowers. Over a period of time, banks have realized this. They have developed loan products that enable a businessman or a professional to borrow for his home buying or to raise money against his property (loan against property -LAP) without having much to show in papers.These loan products are for those who have proven track record of other loan repayment and/or sustainable business for many years in specific industry and also a reasonably healthy bank balance.Here are a few of those loan products discussed hereunder:Other loan track: There are many businessmen, who have accessed big loans such as such as, equipment loan, mortgage, commercial vehicle loan. They have been repaying the existing loans without any default. In such circumstances, a bank may look at such a borrower as a promising customer. A bank may want to lend to such a borrower a sum equal to or less than his previous loan. For example, a businessman borrowed Rs 50 lakh for machinery from Bank A three year back. For last three years, he has been sticking to his loan repayment schedule. In such a scenario, bank B may consider lending him a sum of Rs 50 lakh or lower. Typically bank B may offer him a sum equal to a fraction of his earlier loan, say 80%, which makes it Rs 40 lakh in the aforesaid case. However, the catch is, the other loan should not have been closed or paid-off more than six months ago.Bank balance: If the borrower has a healthy bank balance and the average monthly balance can well-substantiate the new EMI for the home loan/LAP he wants to take, this could be accepted by the lender.EMI equaliser: Depending upon the total other loan EMI-s, a borrower is already servicing, the new home loan/LAP can get approved. A market average of 1.5 times of the current EMI is allowed as the total exposure. For example, if someone is already paying Rs 2 lakh as his all other EMI-s put together, then he can be allowed another Rs 1 lakh as additional EMI for the new loan, which will be an approximately Rs 1 crore borrowing.Same loan track: During a home loan transfer, if the borrower doesn't want to go through the hassle of doing the paperwork again, then basis the previous track on the same loan, the transfer can happen. The reduced EMI in the new bank can also make for some room to borrow an additional amount as 'top-up' loan (cash in hand) without any additional documentation.Gross profit method: For an industry where the turnover is very high but the profit margin is always low (trading business), the lenders do approve of the calculation basis the gross profit and not the net.Turnover based on industry margin: If the borrower is in a manufacturing or trading business then a standard profit margin has been internally set by the borrower. For example, a manufacturing unit with Rs 2 crore of turnover is expected to make a 10% profit and thus the income can be considered as Rs 20 lakh and basis this the loan application can be granted, even if it is not shown. Similarly, for a trading business, it could have been set at 5% as there are no assets such as machinery, plant, semi-finished goods. A manufacturing unit typically has such assets and been flagged at a little higher risk grade. At the same time, a service industry may not be considered for this type of surrogate funding at all.Gross receipts: This programme is applicable for self-employed professionals like chartered accountants, architect, engineer, doctors, who though receive a high gross amount, their net profit may get eroded through salaries to their staff or other establishment costs. For them, a special eligibility calculation method is adopted by the lenders on the gross receipts.Liquid income programme: An estimate is drawn by a team of chartered accountants appointed by the lender who visit the work premise of the borrower to know the minute details of the business. For example, if someone has a business of stationery-shop or saree-sales or sending truckload of sands from one destination to another, it is not very sure how much of documentation is in place. Most transactions are done without proper bill and challan and sometimes are multiple transactions without a receipt. However, these could be quite profitable business and safe to lend.No income proof (60:40): If the borrower pays 60% of the property cost towards acquisition and his credit score is fine, then without considering his income-documents, 40% is funded as home loan. This is due to the majority stake (investment) in the property by the borrower, which makes the lender comfortable, especially when he hasn't had any bad credit history earlier.Premium relationship pre-approval: Some banks have this facility to offer you a 'pre-approved' loan, basis the borrower's profile and his banking relationship in terms of deposits and investments made through their banking channel. This doesn't require submission of any income proof and only the mandatory KYC norms to be met with.So, do not lose your heart if your net profit shown is not too high but you are confident of paying off the loan. There are lenders who understand your business and will help you get the funding too.It is important to note that a borrower's assets are not considered as income as many make that mistake of believing that if he owns properties worth Rs 10 crores, the lender will be happy to give him a loan. It is not so. A borrower needs to have regular flow of steady income for the lender to extend even the first rupee.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/personal-finance/how-to-borrow-large-sum-despite-low-net-take-home-income-1503623.html,Funding,"However, the catch is, the other loan should not have been closed or paid-off more than six months ago.Bank balance: If the borrower has a healthy bank balance and the average monthly balance can well-substantiate the new EMI for the home loan/LAP he wants to take, this could be accepted by the lender.EMI equaliser: Depending upon the total other loan EMI-s, a borrower is already servicing, the new home loan/LAP can get approved.The reduced EMI in the new bank can also make for some room to borrow an additional amount as 'top-up' loan (cash in hand) without any additional documentation.Gross profit method: For an industry where the turnover is very high but the profit margin is always low (trading business), the lenders do approve of the calculation basis the gross profit and not the net.Turnover based on industry margin: If the borrower is in a manufacturing or trading business then a standard profit margin has been internally set by the borrower.","['EMI', 'EMI']",[]

Development banks pledge USD 15 bn in new climate funds,10 October,"Development banks including the World Bank have pledged an additional USD 15 billion a year by 2020 to fight climate change, taking the world closer to the clutch target of USD 100 billion, officials have said. Just two months before key UN climate talks in Paris, world leaders are scrambling to reach the magic number of USD 100 billion in funding to combat global warming and help vulnerable nations cope with the impact of climate change. The figure, agreed in previous rounds of talks, is seen as a make-or-break issue in the years-long negotiations to reach a comprehensive carbon-cutting pact to save the planet from the potentially catastrophic impacts of global warming. The World Bank announced it would increase climate financing from 21 percent of its total funding to 28 percent in 2020. In dollar terms, that would be an increase from an average of USD 10.3 billion a year now to USD 16 billion a year in 2020, at current funding levels. ""We are committed to scaling up our support for developing countries to battle climate change,"" World Bank president Jim Yong Kim said in a statement.""As we move closer to Paris, countries have identified trillions of dollars of climate-related needs. The Bank, with the support of our members, will respond ambitiously to this great challenge,"" he said.French finance ministry officials said other development banks including the European Investment Bank, Asian Development Bank and Inter-American Development Bank had made similar pledges for a total of around USD 15 billion in new funds. ""We were expecting a lot from the multilateral banks... and they rose to the challenge,"" said French Finance Minister Michel Sapin as he left a climate meeting that brought together some 50 countries and institutions in the Peruvian capital Lima.

The last steps are often the most difficult,"" he added.Sapin had criticized the development banks for not doing more on climate-related funding as world economic leaders met in Lima this week for the annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. ""They haven't done a lot,"" he told journalists Thursday. ""If we want the Paris conference to be a success, the question of funding has to be nine-tenths settled, if not 100 percent.""

Sebi slaps Rs 2 lakh fine on United Bank of India,10 September,"Sebi on Thursday imposed Rs 2 lakh penalty on state-run United Bank of India (UBI) for violating norms related to debenture trustees. An inspection of UBI's books of accounts, for the period 1992-2013, certain deficiencies in its functioning as debenture trustee, Sebi said in an order. UBI is registered with Sebi as a debenture trustee. The case pertains to UBI acting as debenture trustee for Power Finance Corp (PFC) wherein some violations of norms have been found. In his order, Sebi's Adjudicating Officer Prasad P Jagadale imposed a penalty of Rs 2 lakh on UBI. ""From the material available on record, the amount of disproportionate gain or unfair advantage to the noticee (UBI) or loss caused to investors as a result of the violation/s is not quantifiable. Further, there is nothing on record to show that the noticee had a past record of default,"" he added. Among others, an entity is not allowed to be a debenture trustee for a company to which it has extended loans. According to UBI, it started accepting debenture trustee assignments from PFC prior to the period of its credit/lending relationship which started sometime in 2003, after which no new debenture trustee assignment was accepted from PFC. However, it continued to act as debenture trustee in absence of appropriate relinquishment of the given assignments at that point of time, it said in submissions made to the adjudicating officer. All the 11 debentures were subsequently duly redeemed by the issuer on their respective due dates. The regulations are silent whether a loan can be sanctioned to a concern during the tenure of its Debenture Trusteeship, UBI submitted.

Sebi widens probe into Castex matter; MFs under the lens,10 September,"In more troubles for crisis-hit Amtek Auto, Sebi has widened its investigation into alleged share price manipulation at its subsidiary Castex Technologies with role of banks, mutual funds and rating agencies also coming under the scanner. The capital market regulator has started an investigation into possible rigging of Castex Technologies' share price through forcible conversion of foreign bonds. While it has taken a serious note of the allegations, sources said Sebi has expanded the probe into the matter suspecting that more players could be involved in efforts to manipulate the share price of Castex Technologies.Besides promoters of the company, Sebi is now looking at the possible role of banks, mutual funds and rating agencies in the whole issue, according to sources. It was alleged by some bondholders that efforts were being made to rig the share price of Castex Technologies by forcibly asking investors to convert their bonds. Amtek Auto and Castex Technologies could not be immediately contacted for their comments.Auto component maker Amtek is grappling with financial troubles and its shares have been battered in recent weeks. Besides, exposure to the company's bonds have created ripple effects in the mutual funds and other market segments as well. In a regulatory filing today, Castex Technologies said that pursuant to mandatory conversion notice issued to bondholders in July it has received conversion notices of USD 80.2 million.""The balance USD 0.6 million is also being converted by the company in accordance with the mandatory conversion notice and the conditions laid down in the bond document,"" it noted. The company has alloted more than 3.94 crore equity at the fixed conversion price of Rs 103.005 apiece, ""thereby effecting the conversion of the outstanding bonds worth USD 80.8 million out of the USD 130 million six per cent FCCB (Foreign Currency Convertible Bond) issue"". Last month, Amtek Auto -- which is a promoter of Castex Technologies -- had said that ""there is temporary cash flow mismatch in the company."" Recently, JP Morgan Mutual Fund restricted redemptions from two of its debt schemes - Short Term Income Fund and India Treasury Fund.The move came in the wake of a decline in NAVs (net assets value) of the schemes due to fund house's exposure to Amtek Auto's debt papers. These schemes have a collective exposure of about Rs 200 crore in Amtek Auto.

ONGC Videsh Ltd reaps Rs 700-crore gain on Euro bonds issue,06 September,"ONGC Videsh Ltd, the overseas arm of state explorer Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC), has made a gain of about Rs 700 crore on a Euro loan it had raised to finance its Mozambique acquisition. OVL had raised Euro 525 million (about USD 712 million) through a 7-year bond issue in July last year to part finance its USD 4.125 billion purchase of a 16 percent stake in Mozambique's offshore Rovuma Area 1, which holds as much as 75 Trillion cubic feet of gas reserves. ""The decision to go for a Euro bond issue has paid dividends. We have made a gain of about Rs 700 crore on account of foreign exchange changes. When we raised the loan, one Euro was equivalent to USD 1.36. Today the ratio is 1.12:1,"" OVL Director (Finance) S P Garg said here. The exchange rate change means OVL will have to repay Rs 700 crore less as its revenues are mostly dollarised. The loan was raised at a highly competitive interest rate of 2.75 percent per annum and the exchange rate changes have meant that OVL is saving Rs 50 crore in interest outgo per annum, he said. Alongside the Euro 525 million raised through a 7-year bonds issue, OVL had also raised USD 750 million by selling dollar denominated bonds of 5-year tenure and another USD 750 million selling 10-year bonds. Garg said the bond sale was the biggest ever from Asia. Also, it was the first euro issue for a government-owned corporate. The 5-year and 10-year dollar bonds were priced at 160 basis points and 207 basis points above the 5-year and 10-year US treasury yields. A basis point is 0.01 percent.

Back to the future: Nokia prepares for mobile comeback,10 August,"Nokia is hiring software experts, testing new products and seeking sales partners as it plots its return to the mobile phone and consumer tech arena it abandoned with the sale of its handset business.Once the world's biggest maker of mobile phones, the Finnish firm was wrongfooted by the rise of smartphones and eclipsed by Apple and Samsung. It sold its handset business to Microsoft in late 2013 and has since focused squarely on making telecoms network equipment.Now Nokia boss Rajeev Suri is planning a comeback. He must wait until late 2016 before he can consider re-entering the handset business - after a non-compete deal with Microsoft expires - but preparations are underway.The company has already dipped its toe into the consumer market; it has launched an Android tablet, the N1, which went on sale in January in China and days ago unveiled a ""virtual-reality camera"" - heralding it as the ""rebirth of Nokia"".It has also launched an Android app called Z Launcher, which organises content on smartphones.Meanwhile its technologies division has advertised on LinkedIn dozens of jobs in California, many in product development, including Android engineers specialising in the operating software Nokia mobile devices will use.Nokia had also planned to lay off about 70 people at the division, according to a May announcement, but a company source told Reuters that the figure had since been halved.PATENT TROVENokia itself is not giving much away about its preparations, beyond saying some staff at the 600-strong technologies division are working on designs for new consumer products, including phones, as well as in digital video and health.But it will not be easy to claw its way back to relevance in the fast-changing, competitive mobile business where Apple has been scooping up nearly 90 percent of industry profits, nor for it to carve out a place in electronics.One ace Nokia that holds is ownership of one of the mobile industry's biggest troves of intellectual property, including patents it retained after selling its handset business. It does not want to waste such resources, built up with tens of billions of euros of investment over the past two decades.It will also get an injection of talent when it completes the 15.6-billion-euro (USD 17 billion) acquisition of Alcatel-Lucent, announced in April, in the form of Bell Labs - a US research centre whose scientists have won eight Nobel prizes.It says it will not repeat the mistakes of the past of missing technology trends, being saddled with high costs, and reacting too slowly to changing consumer tastes.To blunt such risks, it is seeking partners for ""brand-licensing"" deals whereby Nokia will design new phones, bearing its brand, but - in exchange for royalties - will then allow other firms to mass-manufacture, market and sell the devices.This is stark contrast to its previous handset business which in its heyday manufactured more phones than any other company in the world and employed tens of thousands.Suri said last month that Nokia aimed to re-enter the mobile phone business, but only through such licensing agreements. It will not fall back on the ""traditional"" methods, said the CEO, who took the helm last May and has turned it into a slimmed down, more profitable company. He sold off its mapping business a week ago.Such brand-licensing deals - as Nokia has struck for the N1 tablet - are less profitable than manufacturing and selling its own products, but also less risky. They can add a tidy sum of revenue for little investment for the company, which generates the bulk of income from selling telecoms network equipment to operators like Vodafone and T-Mobile.""They want to be innovative and seen as a company with long-term vision in the (tech) industry and having a foot in devices plays into this impression, even if it's not bringing massive revenue at the outset,"" said Gartner analyst Sylvain Fabre.NEWCOMERSBrand-licensing models are not new in the industry; European companies like Philips and Alcatel have made money from consumer electronics by licensing out their brand after capitulating to Asian competitors more than a decade ago.But given the crop of newcomers like China's Xiaomi and India's Micromax, it may not be possible for Nokia to reproduce even the minor successes that Philips and Alcatel were able to achieve by renting out their brand.With advances in contract manufacturing and standardisation of software, components and features like touch-screens, it is also easier than ever for companies to outsource everything to produce lookalike phones.""We only see this competitive pressure intensifying in coming years,"" said CCS Insight mobile analyst Ben Wood. ""Barriers to entry in the handset market are lower than ever and almost anyone can enter the smartphone market.The strength of the Nokia brand - crucial to the success of such licensing deals - is also open to debate.The company says its brand is recognised by four billion people. But, after being consistently ranked as one of the world's top-five brands in the decade up to 2009 according to market researcher Interbrand, it has since nose-dived and now looks set to disappear from top 100 lists.""A brand is quickly forgotten if it is absent from the consumer business,"" said former Nokia executive Anssi Vanjoki, a professor at Finland's Lappeenranta University of Technology.""The brand will not help much if the product is similar to what is already being sold out there.
