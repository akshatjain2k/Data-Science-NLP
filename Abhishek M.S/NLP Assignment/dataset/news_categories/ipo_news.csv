Alibaba shares soar after historic overhaul heralds IPO wave,29 March,"Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.’s US shares closed 14.3% higher after China’s online commerce leader announced plans to split its $220 billion empire into six business units, a major restructuring that promises to yield several initial public offerings.The move frees up the Chinese company’s main divisions from e-commerce and media to the cloud to operate with far more autonomy, laying the foundation for future spinoffs and market debuts.The shift to a holding company structure is rare for major Chinese tech firms and could present a template for Alibaba’s peers. Decentralizing the company’s business lines and decision-making power addresses one of Beijing’s primary goals during its sweeping crackdown on the technology sector.The government had criticized the influence of online platforms, particularly those of Alibaba and WeChat operator Tencent Holdings Ltd. That will likely mean the restructuring would draw support from government regulators who have been concerned that concentrated power in tech suppressed innovation. Alibaba and Tencent invested in hundreds of startups over the years, often helping to craft strategy as they grew.Alibaba’s US-listed shares ended New York trading Tuesday at $98.40. Tencent’s US shares closed 8.03% higher, while those of Chinese internet search giant Baidu Inc. ended the day with a 4.7% gain.“It is one step in the direction with China’s policy to reduce the monopolistic nature of the tech giants,” said Marvin Chen, an analyst with Bloomberg Intelligence. “While China tech spinoffs are not uncommon, the move looks to be more encompassing, including core businesses, that may serve as a blueprint for the industry going forward.”Alibaba’s announcement Tuesday coincided with the return of its billionaire co-founder Jack Ma to China after more than a year abroad.It marks a departure from the internet company’s traditional preference for keeping most of its operations under one roof, running everything from supermarkets to datacenters under the main Alibaba umbrella. It’s also a strong signal that Alibaba is ready to tap investors and public markets, after the Xi Jinping administration’s clampdown on internet spheres wiped out more than $500 billion of its value.Group Chief Executive Officer Daniel Zhang will head up the cloud intelligence division, a nod to the growing role that AI will play in the e-commerce leader’s portfolio in the long run. He will continue to run the parent company.International commerce chief Jiang Fan will head up the global digital business unit, while longtime executive Trudy Dai takes up the main Taobao Tmall online shopping division. Its other divisions include local services such as meal delivery, the Cainiao logistics group and digital media and entertainment.“At 24 years of age, Alibaba is welcoming a new opportunity for growth,” Zhang said in a statement. “The market is the best litmus test, and each business group and company can pursue independent fundraising and IPOs when they are ready.”Alibaba has had previous success with spinoffs. It hived off Alipay in 2010, an unpopular move at the time that nonetheless lead to the creation of Ant Group Co. The fintech affiliate controlled by Ma was on the verge of pulling off the world’s largest IPO before Beijing pulled the plug, and has said it would consider a second run at the market.Despite the creation of a half-dozen business lines, Alibaba on Tuesday reaffirmed the cost-cutting it had pledged to shore up the bottom line. That was a conservative shift for a tech conglomerate that once spent aggressively to dominate swaths of the economy, reflecting the dissipation of growth since Xi’s crackdown ensued in 2020.Beijing has cracked down on the country’s tech giants over the last two years, forcing fundamental changes in the business models of companies including Alibaba. The e-commerce pioneer is also navigating increasingly tough competition from arch-rival JD.com Inc. as well as up-and-comers such as PDD Holdings Inc. and ByteDance Ltd.“The innovative plan to split up its businesses, we assume has had some kind of blessing from the authorities,” said Gary Dugan, chief executive officer at the Global CIO Office. “In which case it will be seen as an elegant solution for unlocking the value inside the business.” ",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/world/alibaba-shares-soar-after-historic-overhaul-heralds-ipo-wave-10328541.html,IPO,"“While China tech spinoffs are not uncommon, the move looks to be more encompassing, including core businesses, that may serve as a blueprint for the industry going forward.”Alibaba’s announcement Tuesday coincided with the return of its billionaire co-founder Jack Ma to China after more than a year abroad.It marks a departure from the internet company’s traditional preference for keeping most of its operations under one roof, running everything from supermarkets to datacenters under the main Alibaba umbrella.The fintech affiliate controlled by Ma was on the verge of pulling off the world’s largest IPO before Beijing pulled the plug, and has said it would consider a second run at the market.Despite the creation of a half-dozen business lines, Alibaba on Tuesday reaffirmed the cost-cutting it had pledged to shore up the bottom line.",['IPO'],"['$220 billion', '98.40', 'more than $500 billion']"

SoftBank-backed Oyo to reduce planned IPO amid tech headwinds,27 March,"Oyo Hotels is reducing the shares it aims to sell via a stock-market debut by about two-thirds, an effort by its founder to get the sale done even after tech valuations plunged.The once-high-flying company is preparing to file a fresh initial public offering document as soon as this week, said two people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be named discussing internal matters. In the filing, Oyo will outline plans to sell just a third of the new shares it originally planned, eroding the amount of fresh capital it is expected to receive, one of the people said.The plan shows how founder Ritesh Agarwal, 29, is trying to push through an IPO even at weaker terms to alleviate the financial pressures on the hotel and lodging booking company and himself. While the travel market has improved from the pandemic-era trough, Oyo — once valued around $10 billion as India’s Airbnb-equivalent — is still reporting mounting losses. Agarwal, meanwhile, took on billions of dollars of debt to boost his holding in the firm.Also Read | Oyo expects more than Rs 5,700 revenue in FY23The situation remains fluid and Agarwal or Oyo may still fine-tune their targets. It’s the second attempt at an IPO by the SoftBank Group Corp.-backed startup, after India’s stock market regulator raised multiple red flags on its earlier try in late 2021. Since then, valuations of technology companies have declined after accelerating inflation and rising interest rates left customers with less to spend and raised concerns of a potential recession.No shares will be offered for sale by Oyo’s current investors, the people said. SoftBank holds about half of the startup, which is formally called Oravel Stays Ltd. and also counts Airbnb Inc. among its backers.Oyo didn’t immediately respond to emails, texts and calls seeking comment.The company was targeting a valuation of about $9 billion and updated its IPO documents in early 2022, but SoftBank later that year reduced its estimate for Oyo to $2.7 billion. The IPO valuation will be finalized through a book-building process nearer to the listing but it’s set to be far from what the company originally envisaged.Agarwal, his holding company RA Hospitality Holdings and SoftBank Vision Fund remain the company’s three promoters with no change from its 2021 prospectus, according to one of the people. In 2019, Agarwal increased his stake to 33% at a $10 billion valuation after taking on $2 billion of debt from Japanese lenders in his personal capacity with the backing of SoftBank founder Masayoshi Son.That puts an urgency to Agarwal and Oyo’s SoftBank-dominated board to push through an IPO despite the punishing environment for tech IPOs and high-profile failures by Indian startups in the past 18 months, one of the people said. It would be a way to prove to the Japanese lenders that the founder and his startup are still worth billions.When Agarwal got married this month in Delhi, Son took a rare trip from his Tokyo base to attend the celebration, accompanied by a bevy of SoftBank executives.While Agarwal isn’t legally required to detail his personal debts in the IPO draft prospectus, he has been warned that regulators could still view that as an investor risk and indefinitely delay or reject the IPO on other technical grounds, one of the people said.Oyo’s business has showed signs of recovery after the pandemic hammered the travel and hospitality industry. The startup has recast itself as a technology company, moving away from the asset-heavy, capital-intensive model across multiple continents which caused billions of dollars of losses, soured relationships with hotel owners and brought on court battles.Agarwal established Oyo in 2013 after dropping out of college. He got the backing of SoftBank’s Son when he was 21 and the Japanese billionaire then took the founder under his wing, mentoring him and, later, providing personal guarantees for his multibillion dollar debt.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/ipo/softbank-backed-oyo-to-reduce-planned-ipo-amid-tech-headwinds-10318861.html,IPO,"In the filing, Oyo will outline plans to sell just a third of the new shares it originally planned, eroding the amount of fresh capital it is expected to receive, one of the people said.The plan shows how founder Ritesh Agarwal, 29, is trying to push through an IPO even at weaker terms to alleviate the financial pressures on the hotel and lodging booking company and himself.It would be a way to prove to the Japanese lenders that the founder and his startup are still worth billions.When Agarwal got married this month in Delhi, Son took a rare trip from his Tokyo base to attend the celebration, accompanied by a bevy of SoftBank executives.While Agarwal isn’t legally required to detail his personal debts in the IPO draft prospectus, he has been warned that regulators could still view that as an investor risk and indefinitely delay or reject the IPO on other technical grounds, one of the people said.Oyo’s business has showed signs of recovery after the pandemic hammered the travel and hospitality industry.","['IPO', 'Agarwal', 'SoftBank', 'Agarwal', 'IPO', 'IPO']","['around $10 billion', 'billions of dollars', 'about $9 billion', '$2.7 billion', '$10 billion', '$2 billion', 'billions of dollars', 'multibillion dollar']"
Mamaearth's parent puts IPO on hold: Report,27 March,"Indian skincare startup Mamaearth has put its initial public offering (IPO) on hold because of weak market conditions, two people with direct knowledge of the matter said, a month after two other Indian companies also scrapped their share sales.Mamaearth parent Honasa Consumer Ltd filed its documents for an IPO in December, planning to raise about $200 million to $300 million, through the issuing of new equity and an offer for sale of some existing shares, which could have valued the company at up to $3 billion.Backed by investors such as Sequoia Capital and Belgium's Sofina (SOF.BR), Mamaearth is now in a ""wait and watch mode"", the sources said, given the turbulence in stock markets globally amid worries about the financial health of banks.Founded in 2016 by the husband and wife duo of Varun and Ghazal Alagh, Mamaearth has been betting on India's booming beauty and personal care market, which is estimated to expand to $30 billion by 2026 and has been growing by 12% a year, per the company's IPO papers.

We planned to file it in March 2023 but due to several reasons couldn't be able to do so. But this time we have decided to go a little small. And it has been seen that in the last one year, hardly any tech company get approval for its IPO from SEBI,"" said Taku.MobiKwik's IPO plans lapsed in November 2022. MobiKwik had approval from India's market regulator for its Rs 1,900-crore IPO, which comprised a fresh issue of Rs 1,500 crore and an Offer-for-Sale (OFS) of Rs 400 crore. However, Paytm's disastrous IPO, which the company took part in with a valuation at $20 billion, dettered MobiKwik.""So, due to this, MobiKwik might not have gone right away for an IPO. Even BNPL valuations have dropped globally with the biggest startup Klarna taking an 85 percent valuation cut recently from their top valuation of $45.6 billion,"" says Prashant Barwaliya, Head of Investments, Stratzy, a SEBI registered company.""We are a profitable company, we have burned less than Rs 50 crore.

"Vaidyaratnam Group plans to double revenue to hit Rs 500 crore, launch IPO by 2030",19 March,"Thrissur-based ayurveda group Vaidyaratnam is looking at closing the current fiscal with a Rs 240 crore revenue and double the same by 2030 when it hopes to go public. The 99-year-old entity is the only ayurveda group that follows the holistic Ashtavaidya tradition. It was started by the late Eledath Thaikkattu Neelakandan Mooss in Thaikkattussery in Thrissur in 1924.The company recorded a revenue of Rs 220 crore, of which Rs 170 crore came in from products/medicines and the rest from services in FY22. This year, they expect only a marginal increase in revenue to Rs 240 crore (Rs 190 crore from products and the rest from services) due to the sharp spike in input costs.""Our 2030 plan envisages more than doubling the turnover to Rs 500 crore. We hope to drive this primarily by entering new categories of treatment like infertility, sports and lifestyle diseases, among others — and also launching new medical products, especially in the nutraceuticals,"" Ashtavaidyan Dr Yadu Narayanan Mooss and Ashtavaidyan Dr Krishnan Mooss, who are the executive directors of the group, told PTI.The key ingredients of the plan include new products and services, a renewed focus on research and development, expanding the network and a special focus on lifestyle diseases and entering the nutraceuticals segment, said the duo in their 30s. They are the fifth generation family members.The group has already made a foray into infertility and maternal care, they said, adding ""we have launched an institute of fertility and maternal care early this year as part of extending our knowledge base to new areas.They are also planning to enter the area of sports medicine in a big way. ""The R&D team is in the advanced stages of work in the area of sports medicine. Very soon, we will be in a position to make a few announcements in the area,"" the group said.""We are also planning the geographical expansion in the coming days. The group has a direct presence in Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Bangalore and Hyderabad. We have identified a few more locations in the Northern and Western regions,"" Krishnan said, adding the immediate focus markets will be Jaipur, Kolhapur and Pune in Maharashtra and the major cities of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana.Stressing the importance of an integrated and holistic system of healthcare, Yadu said the younger generation is becoming more aware of the ayurveda system.""We're receiving youngsters, especially professionals in the fields of IT and management, seeking help in areas that are generally associated with lifestyle issues. Apart from diabetics, we've also noticed increasing incidence of hypertension, insomnia, and irritable bowel syndrome amongst the youngsters, he said, adding the Ashtavaidya system has efficient remedies for these ailments.The focus of the group will be on the treatment and prescription-based medicines, they said and ruled out entering the wellness segment, saying their competence is in delivering quality treatment and medicines.""We will focus on these areas with renewed vigour on research and development."" Along with infertility and maternal care, they have also identified several other areas with good potential for using our knowledge base and expertise.""Some of these areas are in various stages of research and it would be too early to make any comments,"" Krishnan said, adding these are the areas that we hope will drive in more money for us.Whether they will take the company public the brothers said they thinking about a public issue after the top line reached the target. They further said that they may also tap the PE route to raise capital if the expansion plans get moving as planned.The doctors, pointing to the difficulty in sourcing the medicinal plants, said to ensure the raw material supply the group is also entering into agreements with farmers in other states, especially Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh.They are also looking at entering into operations and management contracts with other ayurveda facilities. They have already signed the 100-bedded Vrindhavan ayurveda hospital in Baddi in Himachal, which was shuttered during the pandemic. Under the O&M deal, they will get a royalty and a commission for supplying staff, who will be paid by the original promoters.The group is also close to ink an agreement with the Saudi government to set up a 100-bedded ayurveda hospital in Riyadh.  It runs a NABH-accredited 100-bed facility at the headquarters, along with a 150-bed medical college in the same location. These will go up to 450 by 2030, they said.From the manufacturing side, which began in 1941, it will increase the capacity of its three units at Thaikkattussery and Chuvannamannu in Thrissur and Pollachi in neighbouring Tamil Nadu.The Ashtavaidya system is based on the Ashtangahridayam, a classic Sanskrit treatise on healthcare and text elucidates eight areas of Kaya (general medicine), bala (paediatrics including obstetrics), graham (psychological disorders), urdhvanga (diseases of the head (eyes, ears, nose, throat and teeth), shalya (surgery and treatment for external injuries), damshtra (toxicology (treatment for poisoning, snake and insect bites), jara (geriatrics and rejuvenation) and vrisha (aphrodisiacs and treatment for sterility).",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/vaidyaratnam-group-plans-to-double-revenue-to-rs-500-cr-ipo-by-2030-10274081.html,IPO,"We hope to drive this primarily by entering new categories of treatment like infertility, sports and lifestyle diseases, among others — and also launching new medical products, especially in the nutraceuticals,"" Ashtavaidyan Dr Yadu Narayanan Mooss and Ashtavaidyan Dr Krishnan Mooss, who are the executive directors of the group, told PTI.The key ingredients of the plan include new products and services, a renewed focus on research and development, expanding the network and a special focus on lifestyle diseases and entering the nutraceuticals segment, said the duo in their 30s.These will go up to 450 by 2030, they said.From the manufacturing side, which began in 1941, it will increase the capacity of its three units at Thaikkattussery and Chuvannamannu in Thrissur and Pollachi in neighbouring Tamil Nadu.The Ashtavaidya system is based on the Ashtangahridayam, a classic Sanskrit treatise on healthcare and text elucidates eight areas of Kaya (general medicine), bala (paediatrics including obstetrics), graham (psychological disorders), urdhvanga (diseases of the head (eyes, ears, nose, throat and teeth), shalya (surgery and treatment for external injuries), damshtra (toxicology (treatment for poisoning, snake and insect bites), jara (geriatrics and rejuvenation) and vrisha (aphrodisiacs and treatment for sterility).","['Thaikkattussery', 'Ashtangahridayam', 'Sanskrit']",[]

HDFC Securities initiates rating Syrma SGS Technology with a 'buy' tag,09 March,"Brokerage firm HDFC Securities has initiated coverage on Syrma SGS Technology Ltd with a 'buy' rating and increased the stock's target price to Rs 294.Syrma SGS is an electronics manufacturing services company specialising in manufacturing printed circuit board assembly (PCBAs). They offer integrated services to OEMs both in India as well as in more than 20 countries and cater to various industries through 13 manufacturing facilities. They focus on high-mix-low-volume products and have a strong focus on R&D and innovation.The company recently acquired SGS Tekniks and Perfect ID to expand their product profile and geographic reach.HDFC Securities says the PCBAs business segment, which contributes 77 percent of the topline, is expected to average a compounded growth rate of 38.4 percent over FY22-26, and the company has announced expansion plans to double production capacity to 30 assembly lines by FY24.""The business segment enjoys a strong demand outlook given the extensive usage of PCBA in daily applications and domestic production falling short of demand. Strong growth in added value, increasing demand for electronic products, requirement for high-speed assembly and miniaturisation make a case for robust demand outlook for PCBA,"" HDFC Securities said in its report.Syrma SGS has announced a host of brownfield and greenfield expansion plans for surface mount technology (SMT) lines, and hopes to have 30 assembly lines on stream by the end of FY24. This is expected to add incremental revenues to the tune of Rs 2,000 crore, the HDFC report said.For the December quarter, Syrma SGS had a strong revenue of Rs 512.6 crore, up 9.8 percent on-quarter due to healthy growth in consumer and automotive segments. The recent acquisition of SGS Tekniks and Perfect ID contributed to the increase in annual revenue growth.Gross margin decreased to 25.4 percent following changes in sales mix, while EBITDA margin decreased to 9.3 percent. The lower margin in the consumer segment and slow demand in the healthcare segment affected margins, but operating leverage helped mitigate the impact at the EBITDA level. The net profit was Rs 33.2 crore, up 17.6% sequentially.As of December 2022, its order book stood at Rs 2,100 crore versus Rs 1,700 crore as of September 2022, which will support healthy topline growth in Q4FY23 and FY24, analysts suggest. Order inflows during the quarter was Rs 900 crore from the industrial, consumer and auto verticals.ODM revenue share dropped to 11 percent in Q3FY23 from 26 percent in Q3FY22 due to reduced exports. The management aims for revenue growth in line with the industry in the coming years and a low double digit EBITDA margin sustainably.Further, Syrma SGS is a beneficiary of the PLI scheme announced by the government to boost domestic manufacturing. The company has received approvals for telecom and networking products, and white goods (air conditioners and LED lights) as it supplies PCBAs to both.""

SoftBank owned arm IPO’s valuations pitched at $30 to 70 billion,03 March,"As Arm Ltd. prepares for a highly-anticipated initial public offering this year, global investment banks are pitching a yawning range of valuations for the chip designer, from $30 billion to $70 billion, according to people familiar with the matter.The current range puts the median value of the deal at around $50 billion, a target that’s been touted by multiple bankers, according to the people. Parent company SoftBank Group Corp. had been seeking a $60 billion valuation last year, Bloomberg News previously reported.The wide range underlines the challenges of valuing the firm against a backdrop of volatile semiconductor equity prices, as well as bankers’ efforts to impress a potential client as they vie for what could be the most coveted IPO deal in years.

Arm later confirmed the decision favoring a Nasdaq listing.The re-listing of Arm, which had traded on the London exchange prior to SoftBank l’s 2016 acquisition, is expected to be a big windfall for Son and the world’s biggest technology investor.Arm is estimated to be worth about $37 billion and anything above that would represent a gain, Kirk Boodry, a Redex Research analyst who publishes on Smartkarma, wrote in a note dated Feb. 1.

"Short Call | Retail investor pessimism, 'K' recovery, and a summer story",28 February,"Quote of the day: ""Everyone in the world is a long-term investor till the market goes down"" – Peter LynchIndices fell for the seventh straight session Monday . That has not happened in almost four years now. Investor pessimism is on the rise, though there is no signs of despair yet in the market. News flow continues to be incrementally negative.Pessimism rulesCash market turnover continues to dip, while the volume of derivatives contracts being traded is making new highs. Does that mean new traders are still flocking to the market?“Don’t go by the notional value of turnover (of derivative contracts),” says Jimeet Modi of Samco Ventures. “Check the premium turnover. And that has been flat year-on-year.” Modi says the mood among retail investors is pessimistic.And they are no longer rushing to buy the dips.“We were seeing buy-on-dips till the Budget. Post the Adani rout, retail investors are choosing to sit on the sidelines instead of trying to average their positions,” Modi says.Sitting tightDealers at domestic brokerages say wealthy investors or HNIs are holding on to their positions, and not panicking yet. But some of them are trying to be clever in this market, when the ideal thing would be to do nothing, says one dealer.“Many HNIs are selling straddles in deep out-of-the-money options, expecting the market to stay rangebound for longer. This looks like an easy source of money as you collect premium on both legs. But when too many people do the same thing expecting the same thing, the market usually gives a sharp move on one side,” the dealer said.Retreat modeFabindia has withdrawn its planned IPO, citing weak market conditions. The garment retailer says it had a bumper year with 40 percent growth in business. The decision to back off despite strong fundamentals could indicate that either (a) there are just no takers for the issue or (b) investors are unwilling to pay what Fabindia is asking for.A few things about IPOs: Good IPOs have found takers in a weak market, for example, Coal India. Good IPOs that somehow scraped through and struggled initially went on to become huge wealth creators, for example, Bharti Airtel. Good IPOs that came in a good market have gone on to destroy value, for example Jet Airways and Suzlon.A summer storyThe recent rally in Voltas has turned out to be short-lived. A harsh summer may be ahead, but similar weather in the past has not changed the long-term industry trend in AC sales, says Goldman. But there could be something for momentum traders here. That’s because Voltas typically outperforms during summer on weather news flow, according to Goldman.The 'K' recoveryShares of premium watch seller Ethos have been struggling for a while, but the management’s upbeat guidance points to strength in the luxury goods segment even as the overall outlook on the economy remains uncertain. In an interview to CNBC-TV18, the management held on to its 35 percent revenue guidance for FY23, and expects to grow 25 percent next year.Quick readsThe Wall Street JournalApartment rents dropped in every major metropolitan area in the US in the last six months through January, and the trend is expected to persist due to a surge in new apartment deliveries. These declines indicate that tenants are reaching their rent affordability limits, and job layoffs are adding to their worries.Cnbc.comAs the number of EVs on the road increases, a workforce with the knowledge to fix and properly maintain them will be needed. But a shortage of such talent may emerge in the near future, creating a big headache for both the automotive sector and drivers.Financial TimesThe record-breaking global bond market rally since the start of this year has fizzled out. Some big investors say the recent sell-off is a sign that it is too soon to pile into bonds; that moment is likely to come later in the year.BloombergThe next few weeks will be crucial for fundraising (by Vedanta). If it fails, the issuer’s B- credit rating, already deep in the junk-bond category, could come under pressure, S&P said this month.

In 2011, it had filed for a Rs 650 crore IPO and had shelved it.Alukkas Varghese Joy, managing director of Joyalukkas, attributed the latest change in plan to poor market conditions, shifting of offices, and the company’s better performance, and indicated the IPO may take place in FY24.“We have shelved the IPO because of several small factors. We feel the market conditions are not that favourable. Besides, we have done better in the last one year and our numbers have improved. We also are in the process of shifting some offices in India,” Joy told Moneycontrol.The benchmark BSE Sensex has returned 4.33 percent in the past year.Joy said with improved figures, the company may apply again for the IPO.“We can’t comment on the IPO amount now. We would like it to happen in FY24,” he said.Gold pricesJoy said the decision had nothing to do with the fluctuation in gold prices, which reached a new high of Rs 57,930 per 10 gm last month before dropping as the US Federal Reserve decided to increase interest rates further.According to Joy, all gold companies in India performed well in 2022, with demand remaining strong despite high prices. “Overall gold consumption has increased in the country,” he said.Global gold demand rose 18 percent in 2022 over the previous year to 4,741 tonnes with a strong performance in the fourth quarter, according to the World Gold Council. Jewellery consumption dropped 3 percent to 2,086 tonnes.The council said Indian consumer demand was robust and fell just shy of the strong demand levels of 2021 because of a sharp local price rally in the closing weeks of December.Joyalukkas will accelerate its expansion plans in India after a slowdown in the past couple of years because of the pandemic. The company had proposed to spend Rs 463.9 crore from the IPO proceeds to open eight showrooms.“We plan to open around 10 showrooms in India this year, mostly in the northern parts of the country,” Joy said.The company has 85 showrooms in India and about 45 overseas, mostly in West Asia.

I didn’t say anything but I know for a fact that they will double the trouble by doing that (going public),” said Singhal.Entrepreneurs must be patient and get to a point where the business is more predictable, where the economic model is found and there is actually reasonable profit to show.“So all the edtech companies must wait to get to a place where they have a healthy, predictable business model and profit and then go public,” he added.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/there-will-be-another-party-soon-says-westbridge-capitals-sandeep-singhal-amid-funding-downturn-10137461.html,IPO,"I think there’s going to be a period when all of us look at what’s happened in the last three-four years, but there’s no doubt that what’s happened over the last three-four years, companies will look at building a stronger, more capital efficient and more thoughtful operations where the customer is smarter, the investors are smarter,” said Singhal in a fireside chat with GSV Ventures’ Deborah Quazzo at the GSV Emeritus Summit.“Next year will be better overall.Tiger Global, a prolific technology investor which has been extremely bullish on Indian startups, did not do a single deal in January in yet another indication of investors turning averse.Layoffs, market cap erosionNot just funding, startups have also witnessed a slowdown in demand and have laid off thousands of employees to navigate the funding downturn.In 2023, more than 2,500 employees have been fired, taking the number of layoffs to about 20,000 since the start of 2022.Not just private startups, publicly listed firms, too, have seen their market capitalisation fall sharply in recent months, with shareholders questioning their path to profitability.IPO is not the answerUnicorns like Oyo, Byju’s and Ola among others have delayed their initial public offering plans.Companies should only look to go public when they have a predictable business and strong profits to show, Singhal said.One thing going around in the ecosystem is that IPO or going public is the solution to the pains of the business, he said.“I have had a lot of friends who had not found the right business model, their unit economics weren’t right but were telling me that they will go public next year.","['GSV Ventures', 'the GSV Emeritus Summit', 'IPO', 'IPO']",[]

"Sensex, Nifty underperform global equity indices in January",30 January,"Indian's benchmark Sensex and Nifty have underperformed many global equity markets in the first month of 2023 amid continued selling by foreign investors and lacklustre earnings reported so far for the December quarter.The recent selling pressure on Adani Group stocks, and banking and new-age technology stocks has also dampened investor sentiment.Both Sensex and Nifty have declined 2.3 percent each in January so far. Meanwhile, major equity markets have started gaining since the start of this year amid expectations that the US Federal Reserve is likely to slow the pace of interest rate increases. Global indices such as the Dow Jones gained 2.5 percent, Ibovespa 2.4 percent, S&P 500 up 6.02 percent, FTSE 100 4.21 percent, CAC 9.6 percent and DAX 8.8 percent.Among Asian indices, Nikkei has risen 5 percent, Hang Seng 12.84 percent, Kospi 6.45 percent and Jakarta Composite 0.11 percent.FII selling""Talking about the earnings so far, there were some companies that did not leave a good taste in the mouth because earnings were not as per the consensus estimates and there were more downgrades than upgrades, particularly for consumer companies and so-called growth stocks. This had impacted the overall market performance. Secondly, markets continue to witness pressure from FIIs (foreign institutional investors) selling as they remain net sellers for 17 consecutive sessions,"" said Raj Vyas, Portfolio Manager, Teji Mandi.FIIs have sold $1.6 billion in Indian equities till date in 2023. FII selling pressure is high in India and funds are shifting to other emerging markets given their attractiveness by discount valuation and revamp in economic growth post the end to China’s Covid zero tolerance policy, according to analysts.Currently, Sensex and Nifty are trading at a one-year forward Price-Earnings multiple of19.23 and 18.44, compared to a 10-year average forward PE of 18.13 and 17.48, respectively. Meanwhile, the MSCI World Index one-year forward PE trades at 16x from its 10-year average forward PE of 16.47x.Corporate earningsEarnings for the December quarter reported so far have not shown improvement. Information Technology companies had a weak start to the quarter, with lukewarm guidance and low headcount additions.An analysis of 200 companies that have reported their earnings for the quarter revealed a 14 percent increase in revenue from the previous year, but no change in operating profit.Net profit also dropped by 5.8 percent, marking the third consecutive quarter of decline. Additionally, employee costs have risen by 20 percent Year-on-Year for the sixth consecutive quarter, reflecting pressures on wage costs and new hiring.Depreciation expenses have also grown at the fastest pace in 7 quarters, and interest costs have surged 30 percent YoY and 16.5 percent sequentially.IT firmsAmong IT firms, HCL Tech reduced its revenue growth forecast for the current financial year to 13.5-14 percent in constant currency terms, down from 13.5-14.5 percent earlier, and lowered its operating margin guidance to 18-18.5 percent from 18-19 percent earlier. Infosys slightly raised its FY23 revenue guidance, but analysts suggested this was an indication of a weak fourth quarter.The number of employee additions fell for these companies, indicating lower demand in the coming quarters. Tata Consultancy Services saw a reduction of 2,197 employees, Wipro saw a decrease of 435 employees and HCL Tech's employee additions more than halved.According to Deepak Jasani, Head of Retail Research at HDFC Securities, these early results suggest a further slowdown in sales and profit for Indian companies, possibly due to global macroeconomic factors such as the end of quantitative easing and the ongoing war in Europe.Factors to considerIndian stock markets are awaiting the Union Budget, the outcome of the Federal Reserve meeting, and the release of December quarter earnings.With many economic factors to consider, it is expected that the markets will be limited in their movement before experiencing a rebound, according to Mitul Shah, Head of Research at Reliance Securities.From the budget point of view, the markets are focused on the long-term capital gains tax, which may possibly be rationalised in the future.""How it will be handled in this budget is the point of contention.

Gautam Adani plans to take at least five companies public,22 January,"Gautam Adani plans to sell shares to the public in at least five companies between 2026 and 2028, to help the his port-to-power conglomerate improve its debt ratios and widen the investor base.“At least five units will be ready to go to the market in the next three to five years,” Jugeshinder Singh, Adani Group chief financial officer said in an interview. He said Adani New Industries Ltd., Adani Airport Holdings Ltd., Adani Road Transport Ltd, AdaniConnex Pvt Ltd, and the group’s metals and mining units would become independent units.Singh ​said businesses such as the airport operator are consumer platforms servicing nearly 300 million customers and need to operate on their own and manage their capital requirements for further growth. He said the businesses would need to show they can clear the basic tests of independent execution, operations and capital management before a formal demerger can be implemented.“Scale is already there for the five units,” Singh said. The “airport business is already independent, while Adani New Industries is going strong on the green energy side. Adani Road is demonstrating new build-operate-transfer models to the nation, while the data center business will grow further. Metals and mining would cover our aluminum, copper and mining services.”Billionaire Adani has faced criticism over the group’s rapid expansion from a traditional port operator to a sprawling conglomerate with assets including media, cement and green energy that some say has increased debt and financial complexity.

Sebi floats consultation paper for ASBA-like process for trading,17 January,"In another attempt to further reduce risks for traders, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) has floated a consultation paper to discuss blocking of funds in the bank account itself rather than transferring them to trading accounts.The market regulator is seeking public comments on the introduction of a facility for blocking funds for trading in secondary markets which allows investors to trade in the secondary market based on blocked funds in one’s bank account thereby eliminating the need to transfer funds to stock brokers.The discussion will also entail providing client-level settlement visibility (both pay-in and pay-out) to clearing corporations by direct settlement of funds and securities between the client and clearing corporation.If realised, this will be similar to the Application Supported By Blocked Amount (ASBA) procedure used in applying for initial public offers (IPO) and other primary market issues. Under ASBA, the fund, though blocked, remains in your account earning interest.Sebi said the proposed process by design safeguards clients’ assets from misuse or brokers’ default and consequent risk to their capital.In the current system, a trader needs to transfer the fund to his or her trading account which is used as collateral for trading. Stock brokers for their proprietary trades and for trades of their clients in turn post collateral with their clearing member, who then again post collateral with clearing corporations to carry out the settlement of trades.In this setup, the consultation paper said, there is a possibility that a client’s collateral retained with a stock broker or clearing member can be misused. Similarly, the pay-out due to the client can also be at risk in case the stock broker defaults.Sponsor-less AMCs possible in India? SEBI thinks yes; calls for opinionsThe proposed setup can revamp the entire process and do away with the need to post collateral at brokers and caring members. The clearing corporation can itself handle the entire procedure directly.In this setup, a trader will use your trading account to just place orders and the fund will be blocked in a linked bank account.3-in-1 accounts not entirely safeMany bank-based brokers provide 3-in-1 accounts where a trader can seamlessly transfer funds between bank account and trading account on need basis. But, this is not entirely foolproof, Sebi said.“Although the funds are held in client’s bank account, the lien is marked in favour of the broker, thus possibility of misuse of client funds by stock broker persists. Since the stock broker is responsible for settlement with the client, the risk of non-settlement of pay-out by the stock broker remains,” it said.The consultation paper is a series of reforms the market regulator has come up with to reduce risks since the Karvy Stock Broking went belly up.

Moneycontrol Pro Panorama | OYO IPO — a test case for new-age companies,04 January,"Dear Reader, The Panorama newsletter is sent to Moneycontrol Pro subscribers on market days. It offers easy access to stories published on Moneycontrol Pro and gives a little extra by setting out a context or an event or trend that investors should keep track of. After clearing several new-age companies' IPOs during the primary market bull run in 2021, SEBI woke up when their prices started taking a beating. If one has to pick a company that caused SEBI to wake up from its slumber, it has to be Paytm.The company offered its shares to the public in a band of Rs 2080-2150 but got listed at a discount and the stock price has since been slipping. The company’s shares are changing hands at Rs 535.SEBI had to draw a lot of flak for not highlighting the valuation concerns in the company.Since then, the market regulator has tried to get its act together. It came out with a discussion paper on disclosures by such companies.The solution sought by SEBI is more transparency in terms of the pricing of IPOs. The regulator wants new-age tech firms to explain in detail the rationale behind pricing their issue by comparing it to pre-IPO share sales, publishing all pre-IPO investor presentations and giving details of what it calls Key Performance Indicators (KPI).SEBI rightly deduced that current valuation parameters like earnings per share (EPS), price to earnings (P/E), return on net worth (RoNW), and net asset value (NAV), as well as comparisons of these accounting ratios with their peers, are useless when it comes to new-age companies. This is because most of them have been loss-making and may continue to do so for a long time.Now, SEBI has a test case in front of it. The market regulator has asked Oravel Stays (Oyo) to refile its IPO papers with applicable details.Oyo filed its Draft Red Herring Prospectus (DRHP) with SEBI in September 2021 for its Rs 8,430 crore IPO.While SEBI has not mentioned the reasons for refiling in its notification, media reports say that SEBI has asked Oyo to update its risk factors, its KPIs, outstanding litigations and the basis for valuation in the company’s DRHP.But will additional information from Oyo help in justifying the valuation? SEBI in its discussion paper acknowledged that new-age technology companies generally remain loss-making for a longer period before achieving break-even as these companies in their growth phase opt for gaining scale over profits.An investor with a private equity mindset is best suited for such companies. Investing in startups is a completely different ball game, and even seasoned fund managers stay away from them. The segment is for private equity players who have the sector understanding, enough capital to de-risk their investments and most importantly, patience to allow the company management enough time to prove themselves.Most retail investors do not have any such traits, they are looking for short-term post-listing gains.All new-age tech IPOs of 2021 disclosed the fact that they are loss-making and may continue to do so. In such a case, valuation becomes difficult using conventional tools. However, analysts from some broking firms justified investments in these issues projecting numbers 25 years forward, trying to capitalise on the IPO frenzy. Additional data in their hands are giving them more tools to be creative in their deductions.In the Oyo case too, SEBI is trying to hide behind data, which a retail investor will never understand.There is no need for SEBI to be over-protective when companies themselves are disclosing that they are loss-making and will remain so for a while. An investor who is willing to understand the risk and pay the IPO premium can do so.In the final analysis, the market will decide if the premium charged by the company is justified.Investing insights from our research teamAutomakers post mixed numbers, CVs continue to drive aheadKirloskar Ferrous Industries: Earnings growth takes the route of cost savings, higher capacityThanks to monsoon, sugar sector finds itself in a sweet spotTrackerEconomic Recovery Tracker | Rural consumer sentiment braves the winterWhat else are we reading?Strong India PMI shows no case for stimulus in this year’s BudgetWhat the IMF has to say about Union Budget 2023Macros have the knives out for Dr Copper in 2023Black Swans in the Year of the Rabbit: Recession, recovery, reboundGST buoyancy poses a welcome challenge for Budget 2023 mathsThe Green Pivot: EVs will reach critical mass this yearThe new Gulf sovereign wealth fund boom (republished from the FT)Chips’ failed rally leaves them historically cheapBeware the dangers of crypto regulationWhat could go wrong for the Federal Reserve in 2023Budget 2023: Rationalise capital gains taxTechnical Picks: ICICI Pru Life Insurance, Bank of Maharashtra, Bank of Maharashtra, Steel Authority of India and Crude oil (These are published every trading day before markets open and can be read on the app).Shishir AsthanaMoneycontrol Pro",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/opinion/moneycontrol-pro-panorama-oyo-ipo-a-test-case-for-new-age-companies-9809431.html,IPO,"The market regulator has asked Oravel Stays (Oyo) to refile its IPO papers with applicable details.Oyo filed its Draft Red Herring Prospectus (DRHP) with SEBI in September 2021 for its Rs 8,430 crore IPO.While SEBI has not mentioned the reasons for refiling in its notification, media reports say that SEBI has asked Oyo to update its risk factors, its KPIs, outstanding litigations and the basis for valuation in the company’s DRHP.But will additional information from Oyo help in justifying the valuation?An investor who is willing to understand the risk and pay the IPO premium can do so.In the final analysis, the market will decide if the premium charged by the company is justified.Investing insights from our research teamAutomakers post mixed numbers, CVs continue to drive aheadKirloskar Ferrous Industries: Earnings growth takes the route of cost savings, higher capacityThanks to monsoon, sugar sector finds itself in a sweet spotTrackerEconomic Recovery Tracker | Rural consumer sentiment braves the winterWhat else are we reading?Strong India PMI shows no case for stimulus in this year’s BudgetWhat the IMF has to say about Union Budget 2023Macros have the knives out for Dr Copper in 2023Black Swans in the Year of the Rabbit: Recession, recovery, reboundGST buoyancy poses a welcome challenge for Budget 2023 mathsThe Green Pivot: EVs will reach critical mass this yearThe new Gulf sovereign wealth fund boom (republished from the FT)Chips’ failed rally leaves them historically cheapBeware the dangers of crypto regulationWhat could go wrong for the Federal Reserve in 2023Budget 2023: Rationalise capital gains taxTechnical Picks: ICICI Pru Life Insurance, Bank of Maharashtra, Bank of Maharashtra, Steel Authority of India and Crude oil (These are published every trading day before markets open and can be read on the app).Shishir AsthanaMoneycontrol Pro","['IPO', 'Draft Red Herring Prospectus', 'DRHP.But', 'IPO', 'aheadKirloskar Ferrous Industries: Earnings', 'PMI', 'IMF', 'Union Budget 2023Macros', 'Dr Copper', 'FT)Chips', 'the Federal Reserve', 'taxTechnical Picks', 'Pru Life Insurance', 'Bank of Maharashtra', 'Bank of Maharashtra', 'AsthanaMoneycontrol']",[]

Why IPO-bound Tata Play’s performance will be under pressure in FY23,02 January,"Tata Play, one of the largest direct-to-home (DTH) players, which is looking to have an initial public offering (IPO) of Rs 2,500 crore, is likely to see a drop in its DTH business, say analysts.The company, which rebranded itself last year after being known for years as Tata Sky, offers DTH services. It also aggregates streaming platforms via Tata Play Binge, which houses around 17 over-the-top (OTT) platforms, and has a broadband service called Tata Play Broadband.Growth in the company’s average revenue per user (ARPU) and active subscriber base has slowed with more people cutting the cord and opting for streaming platforms for content, as well as competition from free-to-air satellite TV provider DD Free Dish. Consequently, revenues from DTH services, Tata Play’s core business, will drop in FY23, an analysis by Crisil Ratings noted.ALSO READ: Two firsts for Tata Play: First in India to take ‘confidential’ pre-filing route; first Tata listing after TCS“DTH operators face risks arising from technological advancements and changing consumer behaviour. The growing popularity of over-the-top (OTT) platforms could be a threat in the medium to long run. With limited product differentiation, the DTH industry is exposed to intense competition among the DTH operators and from cable TV operators as well as Free Dish,” said Crisil Ratings.Queries on financial performance emailed to Tata Play had not not elicited a response till the time this article was published.The DTH business contributes 96 percent to the company’s overall revenue.Shifting landscape“If we look at the subscriber count today, then the Free-To-Air (FTA) part is gaining, Multiple System Operators (MSOs) are losing and DTH is flat. Then there is connected TV (TV sets connected to the internet, mostly used to view streaming content), which is 10 million households currently and estimated to increase to 20-25 million households over the next three years,” said Karan Taurani, senior vice-president, Elara Capital. “We will move towards 220 million TV households in the next three years, of which a large portion of growth will come from free-to-air and connected TV.”He added that FTA and connected TVs will add close to 15 million and 20-25 million households, respectively. Overall, 75 percent growth in TV households will come from connected TVs and FTA. Only a small portion of growth will come from DTH services.According to Taurani, Tata Play’s DTH business will be under pressure as linear TV and Pay TV are not gaining much ground in terms of adding new households.""Growth for DTH will be 3-4 percent and ARPUs will see 6-7 percent growth in the near-term due to channel price hikes because of implementation of the NTO (New Tariff Order). However, channel pricing is increasing after around three years, so this growth cannot be expected every year. So, in the medium to long term there are challenges,"" the analyst said.In 2019, the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) had introduced a new regulatory framework called NTO, popularly known as the MRP (maximum retail price) regime for TV channels, to bring more transparency into pricing.How the numbers stack upAccording to TRAI data, the number of paying direct-to-home (DTH) subscribers declined to 66.92 million in March 2022 from 68.52 million in December 2021. In June 2022, pay DTH active users inched up to 67.04 million.Tata Play had 23 million active pay subscribers at the end of March 2022.In FY22, the company reported revenue from the direct-to-home (DTH) segment at Rs 4,566.68 crore compared to Rs 4,593.01 crore in FY21, a drop of 0.57 percent. In FY21 as well, Tata Play’s DTH segment was down 1.2 percent from Rs 4,648.83 crore the previous fiscal year.While Tata Play’s consolidated operating revenue grew by 1.3 percent year-on-year in FY22 on the back of growth in revenues from the broadband business and traction for the Tata Binge mobile application, operating margins are estimated to see pressure during FY23 due to operating losses accruing from Tata Play Binge, said Crisil Ratings.The company had reported operational revenue of Rs 4,741.07 crore in FY22 versus Rs 4,682.21 crore in the previous fiscal.“The DTH business has been under pressure because of the onslaught of fibre/ broadband. To add to this, all the local cable operators are also going the digital way. Further, cord cutting has started happening, especially in major cities, with the advent of OTT,” said Nitin Menon, co-founder of NV Capital. “Today linear television is facing the heat with a lot of homes especially in the metros watching their shows on broadband rather than the conventional cable route.”The decline as well as slow growth in DTH subscribers is a concern for Tata Play, which saw its subscriber market share drop to 32.8 percent as on June 30, 2022, versus 33.4 percent a year earlier, according to TRAI data.Industrywide challengesCrisil Ratings said that the drop in the company’s active subscriber base is due to industry-level headwinds coming from competition from DD Free dish and other growing digital entertainment alternatives.“People are moving to smart TVs from DTH, and as we move ahead we will see smart TV penetration. Here, the set top boxes may not have any play unless they offer a combo pack in terms of OTT apps and channels. There are concerns for the growth of core DTH subscribers,"" said Taurani.He also pointed out that a lot of investment is needed by Tata Play to get a large subscriber base for Tata Play Binge. “OTT players go for bulk deals, hence, this is a business of scale.""Tata Play Binge aims to increase the number of streaming platforms to 25 by the end of FY23 and noted that it had reached 10 lakh customers in November last year.Menon said that while the OTT as well as the broadband business should add growth, it will take time before these businesses become strongly cash-flow positive.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/why-ipo-bound-tata-plays-performance-will-be-under-pressure-in-fy23-9800201.html,IPO,"In FY21 as well, Tata Play’s DTH segment was down 1.2 percent from Rs 4,648.83 crore the previous fiscal year.While Tata Play’s consolidated operating revenue grew by 1.3 percent year-on-year in FY22 on the back of growth in revenues from the broadband business and traction for the Tata Binge mobile application, operating margins are estimated to see pressure during FY23 due to operating losses accruing from Tata Play Binge, said Crisil Ratings.The company had reported operational revenue of Rs 4,741.07 crore in FY22 versus Rs 4,682.21 crore in the previous fiscal.“The DTH business has been under pressure because of the onslaught of fibre/ broadband.“Today linear television is facing the heat with a lot of homes especially in the metros watching their shows on broadband rather than the conventional cable route.”The decline as well as slow growth in DTH subscribers is a concern for Tata Play, which saw its subscriber market share drop to 32.8 percent as on June 30, 2022, versus 33.4 percent a year earlier, according to TRAI data.Industrywide challengesCrisil Ratings said that the drop in the company’s active subscriber base is due to industry-level headwinds coming from competition from DD Free dish and other growing digital entertainment alternatives.“People are moving to smart TVs from DTH, and as we move ahead we will see smart TV penetration.","['Tata Play’s DTH', 'Tata Binge', 'Tata Play Binge', 'DTH', 'DTH', 'DD Free', 'DTH']",[]
Mamaearth IPO: Five key highlights from its DRHP,30 December,"Digital-led beauty and personal care company Mamaearth was the first unicorn of 2022.As the year draws to a close, one may perhaps look at it in hindsight and say that it was a sign of things to come – as the first unicorn of the year was also a profitable company. In the last 12 months, the sheen has worn off many in the billion-dollar valuation club as investors, private as well as public, have checked out of loss-making-but-fast-growing companies.Just before the end of 2022, Mamaearth also became the last unicorn of the year to file for an initial public offering (IPO). The company is now looking to raise as much as Rs 400 crore through a fresh issue of shares, apart from an offer for sale (OFS) of around 4.7 crore shares.Here, we take a look at five such important things to note from its draft red herring prospectus (DRHP) that was filed with the market regulator yesterday (December 29).Profitability mattersA lot of internet-led companies have suffered in the stock market this year as central banks tightened interest rates and investors fled from loss-making new-age companies. For this reason, startups like Snapdeal, Mobikwik and Boat have either postponed or shelved their IPOs.Floating its IPO at such a time, Mamaearth seems to have taken confidence from its profitability. The company became profitable in FY22 with net earnings of Rs 14 crore, compared to losses of Rs 1,332 crore in FY21 and Rs 428 crore in FY20. In the first half of FY23, the company registered a net profit of 4 crore.The company has claimed in its IPO prospectus that it is deriving benefits from economies of scale — as its gross profit margin improved over 3 percentage points from 66.5 percent in FY20 to 69.96 percent in FY22.Ads and e-commerce fees are large cost centresThe rise of digital-first consumer brands like Mamaearth and Sugar have been dependent on two critical factors — a deft use of social media marketing campaigns and utilising e-commerce marketplaces like Nykaa, Amazon and Flipkart as sales channel.But these instruments of growth don’t come cheap. Mamaearth’s ad expenses outstripped its sales growth as this cost centre expanded 120 percent to Rs 391 crore in FY22. Further, its sales commission to e-commerce marketplaces grew 114 percent to Rs 29 crore in FY22.Growth is slowingAs the company is getting bigger in terms of scale, its growth machine appears to be slowing down. While Mamaearth’s revenue from operations rose 318 percent to Rs 460 crore in FY21, it registered a growth of 105 percent to Rs 943 crore in FY22.In the first six months of the current fiscal, the company has logged operating revenue of Rs 723 crore. Assuming the same revenue run rate in the rest of the fiscal (as the company claims in its IPO prospectus that seasonalities do not impact its business), it would grow around 53 percent in FY23.Over-dependence on a few productsThe company’s IPO prospectus cautioned that the business has a significant dependence on the sale of its top 10 products.

Qualified institutional placements lose the charm as volatility dampens market sentiment,29 December,"Year 2022 will be the second year when Indian companies refrained from raising funds through the qualified institutional placement (QIP) route, which was popular in the years before the pandemic.Fundraising through QIPs declined 72 percent year on year (YoY) -- its steepest fall since 2018.Volatility and global headwinds saw companies waiting for better days to get more bang for their buck. Fourteen firms raised around Rs 11,744 crore through QIPs so far this year, a far cry from as many as 35 companies raising Rs 42,000 crore in 2021, data from Prime Database showed.On the other hand, initial public offers (IPOs) have been a popular route this year. That said, even IPO mop-ups have fallen dramatically, compared with 2021. As many as 38 companies raised around Rs 58,960 crore through IPOs so far this year. In 2021, 63 firms have mopped up Rs 1.19 lakh crore.What are QIPs?QIP is a popular instrument for listed firms to raise capital by selling shares or  debentures, fully or partly, which can be converted to stocks to institutional investors.QIPs help companies to meet quick working capital requirements or even for setting up new capacity. While the overall QIP mop-up was waning, real-estate and financial sector firms pursued it.Why is there a lull now?Besides market volatility, a lacklustre economic growth after the pandemic has seen companies not raising fresh resources. After all, the private capex cycle is yet to fully revive and investment decisions haven’t actively reached corporate board rooms yet.""While IPOs offer the flexibility of secondary sale, QIPs would involve money in the company, and, unless there is need for money, QIPs have limitations. Further, given the market volatility and lower-than-expected capex, QIPs would see a slow uptick for another 9-12 months. Also, surplus liquidity with most corporates, after the COVID era, has further reduced the need of money, and, hence, the need for QIPs in most of well-run companies,"" said Gopal Agrawal, Managing Director & Head, Investment Banking, Edelweiss financial services.Companies that took the QIP routeMacrotech Developers raised around Rs 3,547 crore, the biggest QIP by size, followed by Indian Hotels Co Ltd and AU Small Finance Bank Ltd (Rs 2,000 crore each) in 2022. Vikas Lifecare Ltd used the QIP option the second time this year and raised Rs 50 crore each time.Other companies include Restaurant Brands Asia Ltd (Rs 1,402 crore), Equitas Small Finance Bank Ltd (Rs 550 crore), Gulshan Polyols Ltd (Rs 79 crore), Jammu & Kashmir Bank Ltd (Rs 94 crore), Indiabulls Real Estate Ltd (Rs 865 crore), Salasar Techno Engineering Ltd (Rs 82 crore), Vikas Lifecare Ltd (Rs 50 crore), Ujjivan Small Finance Bank Ltd ( Rs 475 crore), and Anupam Rasayan India Ltd (Rs 500 crore).To be sure, QIPs are unlikely to return to the top of the table of fundraising the next year, if market volatility and global events are not conducive, according to analysts.The Sensex and the Nifty have been steadily climbing since October after having a rather subdued period from the start of the year. Since October, both Sensex and Nifty have gained 7.5 percent each.""The volatile markets have affected the performance of the secondary and primary markets. This has disturbed the sentiment and pricing of stocks, discouraging corporates from coming to the market for funding,"" said Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial Services.Monetary policy tightening, especially by the US Federal Reserve, is likely to keep global markets under pressure. This would weigh on domestic sentiments as well. Given that foreign institutional investors are big participants in QIPs, raising funds through this route would continue to be a challenge. That said, for the right valuation, foreign investors are willing to take exposure to Indian equities.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/ipo/qips-lose-lustre-in-2022-as-global-volatility-keeps-sentiment-weak-9764141.html,IPO,"Also, surplus liquidity with most corporates, after the COVID era, has further reduced the need of money, and, hence, the need for QIPs in most of well-run companies,"" said Gopal Agrawal, Managing Director & Head, Investment Banking, Edelweiss financial services.Companies that took the QIP routeMacrotech Developers raised around Rs 3,547 crore, the biggest QIP by size, followed by Indian Hotels Co Ltd and AU Small Finance Bank Ltd (Rs 2,000 crore each) in 2022.Vikas Lifecare Ltd used the QIP option the second time this year and raised Rs 50 crore each time.Other companies include Restaurant Brands Asia Ltd (Rs 1,402 crore), Equitas Small Finance Bank Ltd (Rs 550 crore), Gulshan Polyols Ltd (Rs 79 crore), Jammu & Kashmir Bank Ltd (Rs 94 crore), Indiabulls Real Estate Ltd (Rs 865 crore), Salasar Techno Engineering Ltd (Rs 82 crore), Vikas Lifecare Ltd (Rs 50 crore), Ujjivan Small Finance Bank Ltd ( Rs 475 crore), and Anupam Rasayan India Ltd (Rs 500 crore).To be sure, QIPs are unlikely to return to the top of the table of fundraising the next year, if market volatility and global events are not conducive, according to analysts.The Sensex and the Nifty have been steadily climbing since October after having a rather subdued period from the start of the year.","['COVID', 'QIP', 'Indian Hotels Co Ltd', 'AU Small Finance Bank Ltd', '2022.Vikas Lifecare Ltd', 'QIP', 'Restaurant Brands Asia Ltd', 'Equitas Small Finance Bank Ltd', 'Gulshan Polyols Ltd', 'Jammu & Kashmir Bank Ltd', 'Indiabulls Real Estate Ltd', 'Salasar Techno Engineering Ltd', 'Vikas Lifecare Ltd', 'Ujjivan Small Finance Bank Ltd', 'Anupam Rasayan India Ltd', 'Sensex', 'Nifty']",[]

Sula Vineyard will take time to kick in. Bow out now or raise a toast for long term,22 December,"As Sula Vineyard, the largest wine maker in India, listed on bourses without any fanfare, analysts said only those expecting long-term gains should stay invested, while the rest can bow out of the stock if they get the allotment.The stock debuted with 1 percent gain but slipped in trade soon as supply pressure mounted. As of 11am, the counter was trading at Rs 344.50, down nearly 4 percent from the issue price.“Considering the market mood, we advise allotted investors to exit on the listing day and wait and watch for buying on better lower valuations after listing and if investors wish to add this on the listing day, conservative investors should better wait and watch, while risk-takers can add and keep it for long term only,” said Prashanth Tapse, Sr VP Research, Mehta Equities.Catch live stock market updates hereThe initial public offering (IPO) of Sula Vineyards was subscribed 2.33 times during December 12-14 with every category getting full subscription, but overall it was lower than analysts' expectations. The issue was entirely a share sale by existing shareholders, meaning the company did not get any proceeds from the IPO.Narendra Solanki, Head- Equity Research Anand Rathi Shares & Stock Brokers, highlighted that Sula vineyards is India’s largest wine producer and seller and has been a consistent market leader in the Indian wine industry in terms of sales volume and value.“The management plans to increase awareness and consumption of wine in Tier-1 and Tier-2 cities as consumption of wine in India is less compared to other alcoholic beverages,” he said. “Investors need to hold for long term for gains.”Over the last five years, Sula’s financial performance has been inconsistent. For the year ended March 2018, it reported a net profit of Rs 12.3 crore. Next year, net profit was Rs 7.2 crore, followed by a loss of Rs 16 crore. For the year ended March 2021, which was the Covid-hit year, the net profit was Rs 3 crore. And the year after that, right before the IPO, it jumped to Rs 52 crore.Sula also has outstanding borrowings of Rs 231.5 crore and cash and cash equivalents of just Rs 13 crore, which are areas of concern.Though, in the long term, growth prospects outweigh these concerns, said analysts.Rajnath Yadav, Research Analyst at Choice Broking, said that considering the lower wine penetration in the domestic market and expanding demographic factors like rising per-capita income and expanding target population, he believes the domestic wine market is on the cusp of exponential growth.The entire alco-beverage consumption market in India stands at 987 million cases. Of this, 30 percent is beer, 69.3 percent spirits and only 0.7 percent is wine.“Sula being the largest producer and seller of wine is well placed to capture the future growth opportunities in the Indian wine market. Long term investors are recommended to remain invested in the counter,” Yadav added.Astha Jain, Senior Research Analyst at Hem Securities, also echoed the sentiments, adding that the company has secured supply of raw material with exclusive long term contracts, which is a big positive.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

What attracted mutual funds to KFin Technologies’ IPO anchor round?,20 December,"KFin Technologies, which is in the process of going public, recently raised Rs 675 crore from 44 investors, including Goldman Sachs Funds, Carmignac Portfolio, Aberdeen Standard SICAV, Citigroup Global Markets Mauritius, Morgan Stanley and Copthall Mauritius Investment.The company, a Registrar and Transfer (R&T) agent, launched its Initial Public Offering (IPO), which comprises only an Offer for Sale (OFS) by its promoter, on December 19. Data published by the stock exchanges showed that the Rs 1,500 crore issue was subscribed 0.55 times on day one.KFin Technologies provides investor solutions, including transaction origination and processing for mutual funds (MFs). It is the largest investor solutions provider to Indian MFs, based on the number of asset management companies (AMCs) to which it provided services (24 out of 41 as of September, representing 59 percent of the market).Computer Age Management Systems (CAMS) is the closest rival to KFin in the Rs 40 trillion Indian MF industry.As per the anchor intimation letter by KFin Technologies, out of the total allocation of 18.4 million equity shares to the anchor investors, 6.9 million, or 37.78 percent of the total, were allocated to eight domestic MFs through a total of 17 schemes.The anchor roundNotably, only the fund houses serviced by the R&T agent subscribed to the shares in the anchor round. These fund houses were Nippon India, Axis, Mirae Asset, Edelweiss, UTI, Canara Robeco, Motilal Oswal and Sundaram.Among the fund houses, Nippon India Mutual Fund (one scheme) had the biggest allocation at 7.41 percent of the overall anchor round, while Axis Mutual Fund also picked 7.41 percent of the overall anchor allocation via three schemes.An executive with a mutual fund house, requesting anonymity, said the R&T business has only two players, having started off with 15. “In my personal opinion, R&T is a very high exit barrier business, and once you get in, it is very difficult to replace,” the person said.What do the brokerages say?Brokerages have a neutral to subscribe rating on the issue.According to Cholamandalam Securities, KFin Technologies is a diversified multi-asset servicing platform and is well-positioned to benefit from strong growth across large markets in India and South East Asia. The brokerage has a ‘subscribe’ rating on the issue.KRChoksey Shares and Securities, which has a ‘neutral’ rating on the issue, said: “Significant disruptions in its information technology systems or breaches of data security could adversely affect its business and reputation.”The brokerage also flagged that certain legal proceedings involving the company, subsidiaries, group companies and certain directors were pending at different levels of adjudication before various courts, tribunals and authorities.KFin Technologies, established in 2017, offers services and solutions to asset managers and corporate issuers across asset classes in India, while in Malaysia, the Philippines and Hong Kong, it provides investor solutions such as transaction origination and processing for mutual funds and private retirement plans.Harshad Chetanwala, co-founder of MyWealthGrowth.com, said KFin Technologies’ closest competitor is CAMS, which has done well in pockets for its investors after listing. However, year-to-date, the stock is down by 20 percent.“Hence, it is not an easy call for investors. One of the biggest advantages KFin Tech and CAMS have is there are only two R&T players from the asset management perspective at present and the asset management business has a long way to go. The preference of investors will change over the period from conservation of wealth i.e. banking to accumulation and growth i.e. investing. Considering the increasing confidence of fund managers in AMCs, if someone is bullish on AMCs, they may also like businesses such as KFin Tech or CAMS. Along with AMCs, KFin tech also offers services to AIFs (Alternative Investment Funds), wealth managers and pension funds,” he said.The risk factorsKirtan Shah, founder and CEO of Credence Wealth Advisors LLP, believes that capitalisation in India is still at a very nascent stage. “MFs themselves are aware of how significantly they've grown over the last three years, and how much business they can get, and hence business that KFin Tech can get,” he said.At the same time, Shah warned that the biggest negative factor is Karvy, because of which the firm has changed its name to KFin Tech.“This is a big negative because Karvy is holding some stake and Karvy is already fighting a legal battle for mis-appropriately handling investors’ funds in the past. Otherwise, if look you look at the valuation, the growth story, everything else look decent,” Shah said.Kfin Technologies’ erstwhile promoters are subject to ongoing investigations by enforcement agencies, including Enforcement Directorate (ED) and the Ministry of Finance.The company received a freezing order from the ED, pursuant to which, the CP Group was, instructed not to sell or transfer in respect of the KFin subject shares (aggregating to 14.12% of the equity share capital).The KFin subject shares, constituting 14.12% of the total equity shareholding of the company, held by certain members of the CP Group are subject to encumbrances in the nature of non-disposal undertakings and blocked positions.""These are ordinary shareholders without having any special rights in respect of management or governance of the company. The company does not have any relationship with the Karvy group, as we severed all other relationships after the 2019 episode. We have to wait for the outcome of the investigations to see what to do with their shareholdings. Now, we have an independent board, corporate governance and board of directors comprising of eminent individuals.

K-Fin Technologies IPO: Why many mutual fund houses are not in the list of anchor investors?,20 December,"The anchor book allocation of K-Fin Technologies (KFINT), the registrar and transfer (R&T) agent that floated an Initial Public Offer (IPO) on December 19, shows that just eight fund houses (all serviced by KFINT) received allocation of shares. KFINT is one of the two largest R&Ts in the Rs 40-trillion Indian mutual fund (MF) industry.Does that mean most fund houses have decided to skip the shares on offer? Though fund managers do not discuss individual stocks, we asked some experts for the reasons in this case.The offerThe KFINT IPO is an offer-for-sale (OFS) where the existing investors are offering their shares in the price band of Rs 347 to Rs 366 per share.Retail investors keenly observe the names of anchor investors to get a cue of the quality of the IPO. An issue is considered worthy of investment if names known for long-term investing are seen in the anchor list. However, in the last one year some of the most sought-after IPOs saw subsequent share price erosion after successful listing on the stock exchanges. That has also made many investors understand why fund houses avoid some IPOs.MF houses understand the business of KFINT very well, as each one avails the services of either KFINT or its nearest competitor, Computer Age Management Services (CAMS), to manage their back office operations. They are best positioned to figure out if these companies will make money in the long term. The CAMS IPO hit the market in September 2020 in the price band of Rs 1,229 to Rs 1,230 per share. The stock now quotes at Rs 2,188. As per Value Research, as on November 30, 2022, 20 fund houses held shares of CAMS in their schemes’ portfolios.Riding the financial services waveService providers to financial service companies are in a sweet spot. Financial service is an expanding space and investors keen on long-term growth are bullish on this theme.Vikas Gupta, Founder and Chief Strategist, Omniscience Capital, says, “Penetration of financial services is low and there is scope for growth over the next one decade. The structure of the RTA industry is such that consistent profitability for a well-managed business is possible. However, current valuations are not cheap and many investors may want to observe the business and the margins on quarterly basis after the company goes public, before deciding to invest in it.”The future growth of financial services companies may attract many growth investors. The large opportunity of future profits can be attractive, especially if one has a long-term view on the business. “A few fund houses that are following the growth style of investing might want to participate in the IPO of this technology-driven financial services company,” says Ravi Kumar TV, Founder of Gaining Ground Investment Services.OFS, not fresh sale of sharesSome investors also give utmost importance to the objectives of the IPO, along with the future prospects. “No doubt it is a good business. But this is just an offer-for-sale. Had the company raised money to fund future growth we would have considered investing. Also, the valuation they are asking for is too costly to invest,” says a senior official of a KFINT-serviced fund house on the condition of anonymity. “We will track the growth story as it unfolds and see how the company funds it. If we get the shares at the right price post listing, then we do not mind investing in it.”CAMS serviced funds: Have these been given a miss?According to industry insiders, the anchor investors’ list is used as a marketing tool by the investment banker. Marquee names in the anchor list infuse confidence in the minds of investors. “Promoters and investment bankers generally choose big names while allotting shares in the anchor list. Anchor allocations are moreover an invitation-only activity. Since we are serviced by CAMS, that could be another reason why we were not approached,” says a senior official with a CAMS-serviced MF house.A fund manager known for his focus on value, concurs. He said, on a condition of anonymity, “We are very selective when it comes to IPOs. Fund houses that keep investing in IPOs tend to develop relationships with merchant bankers. None approaches us for anchor allocations.”“We have no option, but to invest in the institutional investors’ category in those IPOs where we have a positive view,” he added.This fund manager had invested in the shares of CAMS, but booked profit as the prices soared.“We are never in the game of anchor allotments, as we are too conservative. As far as the KFIN IPO is concerned, there is no compelling reason to apply in this IPO at this price,” said the chief investment officer with a KFINT-serviced MF house, who too, preferred to speak on condition of anonymity.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/personal-finance/k-fin-technologies-ipo-why-many-mutual-fund-houses-are-not-in-the-list-of-anchor-investors-9732561.html,IPO,"Though fund managers do not discuss individual stocks, we asked some experts for the reasons in this case.The offerThe KFINT IPO is an offer-for-sale (OFS) where the existing investors are offering their shares in the price band of Rs 347 to Rs 366 per share.Retail investors keenly observe the names of anchor investors to get a cue of the quality of the IPO.“A few fund houses that are following the growth style of investing might want to participate in the IPO of this technology-driven financial services company,” says Ravi Kumar TV, Founder of Gaining Ground Investment Services.OFS, not fresh sale of sharesSome investors also give utmost importance to the objectives of the IPO, along with the future prospects.","['OFS', 'IPO.“A', 'IPO', 'Founder of Gaining Ground Investment Services', 'OFS', 'IPO']",[]

"After this year’s IPO slump, bankers are wary of 2023 relief",18 December,"Initial public offerings are heading for their longest drought since the global financial crisis —  and bankers don’t expect a revival anytime soon.A mix of rising inflation and interest rate hikes aimed at taming it have hurt stock market valuations and eroded investor appetite for the high-growth IPO candidates that have driven deals in recent years. Just $207 billion have been raised this year from listings  — 68% down versus last year — as a surge in flotations in China and the Middle East failed to make up for a frozen US market.“Two things are needed for ECM activity to resume: stability around inflation and visibility on the trajectory for interest rate hikes,” said Edward Byun, co-head of Asia ex-Japan equity capital markets at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. “Once there is conviction inflation has peaked and clarity on the rate outlook — likely in the second quarter of next year — we will begin to see the market move forward.”This year’s listings slump is the worst since IPO values tumbled 73% in 2008, according to Bloomberg data. It follows a 2021 boom when peaking stock markets and a US blank-check listing craze led to an unprecedented $655 billion IPO haul. Since then, however, high-growth tech companies without a path to profitability have lost favour while consumer firms are finding investor support lacking as inflation surges.It doesn’t help that so many of last year’s IPO stars are underwater. On average, the crop of 2021 US market debutantes is down 19% since going public — among them once highly sought-after EV startup Rivian Automotive Inc, which is down almost 70%.US Dries UpThe US IPO market has been one of the biggest drags, hit by a collapse in the blank-check deals that were behind 2021’s surge. Listing volumes of $24 billion are the lowest since 1990 and down 93% over 2021, with bankers saying that investors will favour stable companies' flotations next year.The two markets that did well in 2022 — China and the Middle East — are likely to continue to do so, say bankers, even though the Asian nation is seeing a surge in infections as it drops its Covid curbs and falling oil prices are dragging down Gulf countries’ stock markets.“Given the Chinese government is loosening regulations on the property sector and we are seeing a clear trend of loosening Covid constraints, we are expecting a market rebound,” said Mandy Zhu, head of China, global banking at UBS Group AG. “We are already seeing increased activities for both onshore and offshore markets.”Companies in mainland China defied the ongoing property crisis and the country’s Covid Zero stance, raising a record $92 billion from IPOs this year, while those in the Middle East have fetched almost $23 billion.Cash calls from companies seeking to shore up their balance sheets have been an outlier in an otherwise gloomy year globally for equity capital markets bankers and will continue to thrive as debt becomes more expensive and economies slow. Almost $716 billion of rights issues were launched this year, just short of 2021’s record $759 billion.Looking AheadStill, with the Fed dashing hopes this week of a dovish tilt, few expect a quick IPO revival.“We expect to see a slow normalization of the IPO market next year. There isn’t a clear path into distress or growth issuance yet, and investor demand will be selective in each product,” said Gareth McCartney, global co-head of ECM at UBS.The US will likely be the first to recover and there are early signs of a rebound there with increased block-trade activity, he added. Among IPOs that investors are watching for this year: Fortnite owner Epic Games Inc., delivery giant Instacart Inc., and sports apparel retailer Fanatics Inc.Europe will follow after that, UBS’s McCartney said, although Asia’s recovery will be predicated on China’s reopening rather than inflation’s direction.“We expect listings next year to come through in dribs and drabs, conceivably as soon as in the first quarter but the IPO market will only be open to a few sectors,” said Andreas Bernstorff, who heads equity capital markets at BNP Paribas SA. “Cyclical and value sectors are likely to be in demand, with energy transition and climate tech companies in particular well-positioned to attract strong demand.”China is expected to see a host of deals next year, while in the Middle East, Abu Dhabi National Oil Co. has chosen banks to lead the IPO of its natural gas business next year in what could be one of the city’s biggest flotations. And in London, bankers and regulators are working hard to keep home-grown tech companies local, especially as SoftBank Group Corp has decided to list UK chip designer Arm Ltd in New York.With so many deals postponed or scrapped, the IPO pipeline is growing longer. Companies that have put off their flotations this year include the multibillion-dollar renewables arm of Italy’s Eni SpA and ABB Ltd. which raised some money privately for the delayed $750 million float in June of its electric-vehicle charging business.In the US, an electric carmaker backed by Vietnam’s richest man, VinFast, filed for an IPO that could raise at least $1 billion, hoping to tap into demand for clean energy stocks, while India’s most valuable startup, online-education giant Byju’s, is finalizing plans for a $1 billion listing of its tutoring business Aakash Educational Services, people familiar with the matter said.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/ipo/after-this-years-ipo-slump-bankers-are-wary-of-2023-relief-9724211.html,IPO,"Just $207 billion have been raised this year from listings  — 68% down versus last year — as a surge in flotations in China and the Middle East failed to make up for a frozen US market.“Two things are needed for ECM activity to resume: stability around inflation and visibility on the trajectory for interest rate hikes,” said Edward Byun, co-head of Asia ex-Japan equity capital markets at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. “Once there is conviction inflation has peaked and clarity on the rate outlook — likely in the second quarter of next year — we will begin to see the market move forward.”This year’s listings slump is the worst since IPO values tumbled 73% in 2008, according to Bloomberg data.Listing volumes of $24 billion are the lowest since 1990 and down 93% over 2021, with bankers saying that investors will favour stable companies' flotations next year.The two markets that did well in 2022 — China and the Middle East — are likely to continue to do so, say bankers, even though the Asian nation is seeing a surge in infections as it drops its Covid curbs and falling oil prices are dragging down Gulf countries’ stock markets.“Given the Chinese government is loosening regulations on the property sector and we are seeing a clear trend of loosening Covid constraints, we are expecting a market rebound,” said Mandy Zhu, head of China, global banking at UBS Group AG.","['listings', 'ECM', 'Goldman Sachs Group Inc.', 'IPO', 'Bloomberg', 'UBS Group AG']","['Just $207 billion', 'an unprecedented $655 billion', '$24 billion', 'a record $92 billion', 'almost $23 billion', 'Almost $716 billion', '$759 billion', 'multibillion-dollar', '$750 million', 'at least $1 billion', '$1 billion']"
IPOs in 2022: Fund mobilisation halves to Rs 57k crore; new year may be even quieter,18 December,"Meltdown in shares of Dalal Street debutants and volatility triggered by geopolitical tensions soured the sentiments for the primary markets, with fund mobilisation through IPOs halving to nearly Rs 57,000 crore in 2022 and the New Year is expected to be even quieter.The overall collection would have been much lower had it not been for the Rs 20,557-crore LIC public offer, which constitutes as much as 35 per cent of the total amount raised during the year. Investors remained jittery throughout 2022 on recessionary fears and rising interest rates amid soaring inflation.”The year 2023 will be tough, with growth slowing down globally, we are bound to see some repercussions in India. I expect a slower or quieter market in 2023, and I suspect money garnered through IPOs next year will be lower than or on the same level as 2022,” said Nikhil Kamath, co-founder of True Beacon and Zerodha.Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services, also believes that the total size of IPOs in 2023 will be muted in anticipation of a volatile stock market.”There is a plausibility that the level of premium valuation India used to garner can reduce in 2023, affecting the pricing of IPOs. The weak performance of recent IPOs will also have a hindsight effect on the investors, reflecting weak response in the near-term,” he added.According to data provided by Prime Database, as many as 36 companies have floated their initial public offerings (IPOs) to raise Rs 56,940 crore in 2022 (till December 16). This figure would increase as the initial share sales of two companies — KFin Technologies and Elin Electronics — are set to kick-off next week to cumulatively raise Rs 1,975 crore.The fund mobilisation in 2022 was way lower than the Rs 1.2 lakh crore raised by 63 companies in 2021, which was the best IPO year in two decades. This fundraising was driven by excessive liquidity and increased retail investor participation, which spurred a persistent euphoria in the primary market.Before this, 15 companies collected Rs 26,611 crore through initial share sales in 2020. Like last year, the majority of the IPOs this year were through the Offer for Sale (OFS) route where existing investors, in one form or another, were offloading stake to retail at relatively high valuations.Apart from IPOs, there was one follow-on public offer by Ruchi Soya, which mopped up Rs 4,300 crore. The exceptional year for IPOs in 2021 gave way to increased market volatility from rising geopolitical tensions, inflation and aggressive interest rate hikes, which contributed to lower fundraising from initial share sales in 2022.In addition, the dismal performance of some IPOs listed since 2021 too affected the fund collection, said Narendra Solanki, Head-Equity Research at Anand Rathi Shares & Stock Brokers. Zerodha’s Kamath also said the under-performance of the recently listed public issue tampered retail investors’ interest, leading to a decline in fund collection through the route.The war between Russia and Ukraine in February turned the environment bleak for investors, making the stock markets worldwide, including in India, nervous. To add to the misery, central banks across the globe raised interest rates to restrict the soaring inflation.This led to the squeezing of liquidity, which in turn disturbed the sentiment of the primary market, affecting the pricing of stocks and discouraging companies from opting for listing. While the LIC issue was the largest ever in the country at Rs 20,557 crore, this was followed by Delhivery (Rs 5,235 crore), Adani Wilmar (Rs 3,600 crore), Vedant Fashion (Rs 3,149 crore) and Global Health (Rs 2,205 crore).Barring LIC and Delhivery, the big size issues were missing in 2022, with an average ticket size of less than Rs 1,000 crore as the weak performance of secondary as well as primary markets reduced the appetite for large offers. Rajendra Naik, MD, Investment Banking at Centrum Capital, said listing day performance and follow-up buying of big-ticket IPOs suffered due to the decline in participation from Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs).The domestic investors such as mutual funds and PMS schemes, who to a large extent substituted the FPIs in the Indian markets, took a more conservative stance and preferred to take smaller positions, and hence IPOs in the range of Rs 500-1,500 crore or the midcap IPOs started sailing through.Some of these IPOs were oversubscribed several times. Interestingly, only two of the 36 IPOs (Delhivery and Tracxn Technologies) were from new-age technology companies, clearly indicating the slowdown of issues from this sector after the disastrous issues from Paytm and a few others.The overall market response to issues moderated with only 14 IPOs receiving a mega response of over 10 times. Harsha Engineers International was the top performer with a subscription of close to 75 times, followed by Electronics Mart India (around 72 times) and DCX Systems (almost 70 times).FiveStar Business Finance was the only one not to get subscribed fully. The response was further muted by the listing performance of biggies like LIC and Delhivery, which were trading 25 per cent below their respective issue prices. Apart from main-board IPOs, small and medium enterprises (SME) collected Rs 1,807 crore, as compared to Rs 746 crore raised by SME IPOs in 2021.Prime Database MD Pranav Haldea feels the IPO pipeline remains strong as 59 IPOs worth Rs 88,140 crore are sitting with Sebi nod and another 30 worth about Rs 51,215 crore are awaiting the market regulator’s approval.

IPO market this year may beat 2021 tally with 89 issues aiming to raise Rs 1.4 lakh crore,03 January,"After a lull this year, the Indian initial public offering (IPO) market is set to witness a flurry of activity this year. Around 89 companies are expected to hit the market to raise around Rs 1.4 lakh crore, according to the data provided by Prime Database.This is higher than Rs 1.19 lakh crore raised by 63 companies through maiden issues in 2021, which was a booming market. In 2022, up until November, 33 firms raised Rs 55,145.80 crore.Here are the IPOs that have received a green signal from SEBI and those which are awaiting approval:A few fund managers are upbeat on IPOs saying that they have helped them generate alpha over the last few years.Though the markets have been scaling new highs, alpha generation in the secondary market has become a demanding task. Anoop Bhaskar of IDFC MF said at Moneycontrol’s Mutual Fund Summit that ""In the last few years, markets have become very flat. It is not easy to find an HDFC Bank as we did in 2008."" But in the last few years alpha generation has come through IPOs, he said.Also Read | Moneycontrol Mutual Fund Summit | Investor behaviour will be key to alpha generation: Fund managersHowever, some investors now seem to hesitate around investing in IPO as recently listed companies’ shares have been trading below their issue price.“Looking at the price movement in newly listed stocks, the Securities Exchange Board of India (SEBI) came up with a consultation paper that it will be involved in the valuation process while IPOs. This step has also been a dampener,” said Nirav Karkera, head of Fisdom.The head of investment banking at a brokerage firm said the likes of Nykaa, Zomato and PB Fintech have significantly eroded shareholders’ wealth and unless the prices of recently listed companies are back to their IPO levels, the concerns would linger.Meanwhile, reports said that boAt has deferred its public share sale plans and raised $60 million from private investors instead amid continuing concerns over the volatile stock market and even Snapdeal has reportedly decided to pull the plug on its IPO citing “prevailing market conditions”. While Ola which has turned profitable might look at going for an IPO this year though a final decision has not been taken.Besides, nothing official yet, but the SoftBank Group-backed food delivery company Swiggy is also looking to file offer documents with SEBI. Swiggy plans to raise around $1 billion through an IPO in 2023, as per reports.Also Read | About 75% of IPOs listed in 2022 are set to end the year in greenHere are some IPOs that the market is looking forward to in 2023:OYOOravel Stays, which owns the OYO brand, had filed its draft red herring prospectus (DRHP) in October 2021 and planned to launch its IPO in 2022 but postponed it due to volatility and bearish market sentiment. The hospitality start-up is now awaiting SEBI’s nod to bring out an IPO in 2023. Its estimated size is Rs 8,430 crore.But despite all the excitement, the company has highlighted two risks that might make investors rethink before investing in OYO’s IPO.The hospitality start-up has incurred net losses each year since incorporation and its ability to achieve profitability may be delayed, the company pointed out. Also, it may not continue to grow at historical rates and may face difficulties in executing expansion plans and implementing growth strategies.OYO started as a hotel aggregator and used to lease some rooms and sell them under its brand name but it changed its business model to a franchise model soon, asking hotels to operate as a franchise and sell their rooms to customers at competitive prices.The hospitality chain’s adjusted EBITDA grew eight times to Rs 56 crore in the second quarter of this fiscal, against Rs 7 crore in the first quarter. Despite the sharp uptick in EBIDTA, the company posted a net loss of Rs 333 crore in the second quarter of FY23. However, the loss has reduced from Rs 414 crore in the first quarter of 2022-23.Its net cash used in operating activities was negative at Rs (2,432.6) crore as of fiscal 2021.FabindiaThe issue size of the famous clothing brand Fabindia is Rs 4,000 crore. Its brands like ‘Fabindia’ and ‘Organic India’ are well recognised in India.In an interview with the Free Press Journal, the company’s Managing Director Viney Singh said the launch timing will be decided after taking into consideration various factors such as relevant statutory approvals, stock market conditions and feedback from investors and intermediaries, among others.Its primary business verticals are apparel and accessories, home and lifestyle, personal care, and organic food. In addition to it, Fabindia also offers healthy dining with regionally inspired foods and beverages through its subsidiary, FabCafe. Fabindia holds a 68.46 percent stake in FabCafe.Fabindia posted a revenue of Rs 1,392 crore for the year ended March 2022 with a net loss of Rs 39 crore, the Economic Times said citing documents filed with the Registrar of Companies and sourced from business intelligence firm AltInfo. During FY21, the ethnic retailer posted a net loss of Rs 117 crore with a revenue of Rs 1,081 crore, its worst performance in two decades.The company in its DRHP explained that during the Covid pandemic, its operating expenses did not decrease at the same rate as revenues, hitting sales, profitability and growth rates.Many of the company’s expenses are less variable in nature and may not correlate to changes in revenues, such as rent expenses, depreciation, employee benefit expenses and other costs associated with operating and maintaining stores and FabCafes. Rental expenses and leave and licence fees account for a significant portion of Fabindia’s cash outflows due to which it renegotiated rental arrangements with mall developers, landlords and lessors during the pandemic.Fabindia is a very well-known brand which will also help in generating strong demand for its shares in the IPO.Yatra OnlineOne of the recent companies to receive the capital market regulator’s clearance is Yatra Online IPO with an estimated size of Rs 750 crore.The company is India’s largest corporate travel services provider and the second largest online travel company in India among key online travel aggregators (OTAs), as per gross booking revenue and operating revenue for fiscal 2020, Yatra Online said in its DRHP citing CRISIL. It also has the largest number of hotel and accommodation tie-ups among key OTAs, as on October 29, 2021, the company added.Yatra reported a nearly 60 percent decline in its loss for FY22 to Rs 48.2 crore. With a recovery in domestic travel demand, the company saw its revenue soar 56.5 percent to Rs 198.9 crore during the fiscal. It generates revenue through two main lines of business: air ticketing and hotels and packages.Considering the competition from goibibo.com, cleartip.com and makemytrip.com among others, one of the risks the company flagged in its DRHP was that the Indian travel industry is highly competitive and that it might not be able to effectively compete in the future.Yatra plans to utilise the net proceeds from the issue for strategic investments, acquisitions and inorganic growth and investment in customer acquisition, other organic growth initiatives and general corporate purposes.Also Read | Infosys co-founder Raghavan, Carlyle-backed Indegene to float Rs 3,200-crore IPOMankind PharmaThe estimated issue amount of the company’s IPO is Rs 5,500 crore, which could be one of the largest ever public issues by a domestic pharma company.Besides branded generic drugs, the company’s prominent brands include Prega-News pregnancy testing kits, Manforce condoms, Gas-O-Fast ayurvedic antacids and acne-treating medicine AcneStar.“We are heavily focused on the domestic Indian market, and have historically derived a substantial portion of our revenue from India,” the company said in its DRHP. After India, its key markets are the US, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Nepal.The company’s revenue from operations stood at Rs 7,781.5 crore in the year ended March 31, 2022, as compared to Rs 6,214.4 crore in the previous fiscal.The pharmaceutical company’s restated net profit stood at Rs 1,452.9 crore from Rs 1,293.0 crore in the corresponding period last year. Meanwhile, the company’s EBITDA rose to Rs 2,003.8 crore in the fiscal ended March 2022 from Rs 1,659.8 crore a year ago.IxigoLe Travenues Technology is the parent company of the online travel portal Ixigo. The issue size of Le Travenues Technology IPO is expected to be Rs 1,600 crore.“In the first quarter of FY23, we did Rs 8.7 crore net profit and we did positive cash flow as well that quarter. So going forward, this funding is more to double down on growth in strategic areas,” Aloke Bajpai, Group Chief Executive Officer and Co-founder, told BQ Prime. For the year ended FY22, its revenue from operations rose to Rs 379.6 crore from Rs 135.6 crore in the previous year, primarily driven by a significant 186.66 percent increase in ticketing revenue and an 81 percent jump in advertisement revenue. For the year ended March 2022, it posted a Rs 21.1 crore loss as against a profit of Rs 7.53 crore a year ago. The company’s recent acquisitions, Confirm Tkt and AbhiBus, are also playing out well, he added.Launched in 2007, Ixigo is an online travel technology company focused on enabling Indian travellers to plan, book, and manage their trips across rail, air, buses and hotels.Tata PlayTata Play, formerly Tata Sky, has filed its offer document with the capital market regulator but is yet to get a clearance. The estimated size is Rs 2,500 crore.Walt Disney Co is looking to offload its entire 29.8 percent stake during the proposed IPO, LiveMint had reported.Disney inherited the stake in Tata Play when it acquired the entertainment business of 21st Century Fox from Rupert Murdoch.

"Better times ahead for steel, JSW Group to continue expansion: Group CFO",19 December,"In 2022, the JSW Group, with its presence in steel and energy, worked in an environment of volatility in the commodity market and energy sector that was driven by geopolitical turmoil.Seshagiri Rao MVS, JSW Group's chief financial officer and joint managing director of JSW Steel Ltd, told Moneycontrol’s Rachita Prasad that steel inventory is piling up due to a decline in exports and this is putting pressure on margins. However, FY24 may be better for the steel industry, driven by domestic demand.The group is also looking at value unlocking opportunities, new businesses for diversification and scouting for acquisitions in the energy space. Edited excerpts:World economies are facing recession and high inflation. The Indian economy has been somewhat resilient. How do you expect things to pan out?There have been some positive macroeconomic developments in the last few days. The prices of energy– both electricity and gas– have come down substantially in Europe. The fall in prices is not small; it’s almost a 65 to 70 percent fall.At the same time, inflation numbers, which were bothering not only central banks but every government and every person, is moderating gradually.The third point is the Chinese relaxation of the Covid norms and also the kind of stimulus they have given to the property sector. These three are very positive macroeconomic developments that are very positive for the industry.We can't just rule out recession in Europe because some people believe that it has already entered into recession. Interest rates have gone up and inflation is still not within the range that central banks would want. To that extent, the global economy may take some more time to come to normalcy.As far as India is concerned, domestic demand is quite strong. The government's infrastructure thrust is driving growth on one side, and real estate construction, which was not doing so well for the last 10 years, is seeing green shoots.The auto sector was not doing well due to the shortage of semiconductors; there is a very good recovery there. After the Covid relaxation, the services sector in India is doing reasonably well. These are all positives but at the same time, India's economy is integrated with the global economy.India’s exports are sizable – over $400 billion of goods and another $200 billion-plus of services. If we need to accelerate growth from our current level of around 6-6.5 percent, we need a kickstart for which global economic recovery is very important. India is resilient from that point of view because of the very strong domestic demand and the kind of very growth-oriented policies the government of India has taken. But at the same time that kickstart is essential for accelerating our growth rates and solving various issues like unemployment.What is the kickstart that the government can provide?Capacity utilisations are at a three-year high, which is an indication that the investments can come in, particularly in core industries in India. Capacity utilisation and export recovery in the manufacturing sector can help the economy. Export recovery is also very important for the manufacturing sector to invest further and create more capacity in India. Many of the sectors are dependent upon exports, particularly the engineering sector, which had exports of $112 billion last year. So it is important that the exports are also recovering for the private sector to spend on capex and create more capacities.The steel industry was hit by high input prices and a decline in exports. You said earlier the second half of FY23 would be better. How do things look?Steel demand in the current financial year has been quite strong. As far as domestic demand goes, there was 8 million tonnes of incremental demand in the first eight months… So if I take the entire financial year, it is expected to be 12 million tonnes of incremental demand over last year. That means 106 million tonnes of consumption in India is going up to 217-218 million tonnes of consumption, close to 10-11 percent of incremental growth. I don't think there's anything to complain about as far as the steel industry is concerned regarding domestic demand.Close to 18.5 million tonnes of steel was exported last year. The fall in exports this year is over 50 percent. That means 8 to 9 million tonnes of lower exports. Even though export duty was removed in November, the global economy is not doing so well. The kind of opportunities to export, which existed last year, are not possible today.At the same time, our imports have gone up by 0.75 million tonnes in the first eight months. It is growing at a rate of 15-20 percent over the last financial year. There is 5 million tonnes of incremental production in the first eight months of the year. If you take the same in the next four months, maybe we will add around 7 million tonnes of incremental production.There is more import, less export, and more production at the same time. So even though demand is growing, we're not able to absorb this entire quantity in the domestic market. That is why there is inventory increase, either with the producers or with the retail channel. So that is where I think there is some pressure, which we are seeing in the steel sector in India.We have repeatedly highlighted the importance of the global economy to recover for the steel industry to ensure that their capacity utilisation will be reasonably high and they will be able to export large quantities.You have maintained your guidance for FY23. Given the inventory build-up and the continuing margin pressure, how is 2023-24 looking?I expect domestic demand to grow the way it did in FY23. Domestic demand is expected to be higher by 10-12 million tonnes in FY24. We are not seeing any big capacities coming into the market. Whatever surplus is there today can be absorbed in the next financial year. Even though the global markets may not recover, the financial pressure we face due to inventories may not be there.There is now focus on decarbonisation. The EU will implement the carbon border tax by 2026. Can you share details of your decarbonisation strategy?JSW Steel has taken a lot of steps. As far as environmental penalties are concerned, it is very important what these penalties are linked to. If they are linked to carbon emissions in one particular industry in a particular country, then any steel that enters that country and does not match their emissions goals will get penalised.Instead of that, our suggestion, which India should negotiate in my view, is that we have nationally determined contributions… As long as we are within those norms when we are exporting our products, there should be no penalty. If we are not able to meet our national standards, then there should be a penalty. I think that maybe a fair way of looking at things, because developed economies have already emitted enough in the past which we are suffering today.Therefore, penalising for not matching the standards of either Europe or the US today may not be fair for India. We are requesting the Indian government to ensure that developed economies do not use environmental tools as trade barriers. It is very important for India to continue to be competitive in international markets.JSW Energy Ltd is building a significant renewable energy portfolio. How is the energy-guzzling JSW Steel tapping into this resource?Our target is to reduce carbon emission intensity by 42 percent compared to 2005 and by 23 percent compared to 2021 by 2030. To achieve this, one of the things we are doing is to transition towards renewable power from fossil fuel-based power.We have entered into a long-term power purchase agreement with JSW Energy for 958 megawatts (MW) of renewable power, which will replace part of the fossil fuel today. But if we look at our 2030 target, I think we may have to do similar power purchase agreements with JSW Energy to set up more capacities for JSW Steel. By 2030, more or less, we will avoid fossil fuel usage in the company.Over and above that, they're also looking at producing green ammonia and green hydrogen. So if they are successful in making this particular fuel available at an affordable price, that will enable JSW Steel to accelerate its programme of transition and decarbonising the industry.Given the energy crisis, countries have renewed interest in coal. What is your energy strategy?We cannot ignore the decarbonising theme. Wherever we have already made investments and have coal requirements, we will have to meet it.Will JSW Group participate in the auction for commercial mining for coal by India?Yes, we will participate in auctions of mines which will be useful to us.JSW Energy recently acquired the renewable assets of Mytrah Energy. Is JSW Energy looking for more acquisitions?JSW Energy has already announced that they will continue to grow only in the renewable space. They are investing money not only in organic growth, but in inorganic growth also. They are continuously scouting for new opportunities in that space. They are also looking at pump storage, battery and the entire value chain and also at green ammonia and green hydrogen.JSW has some smaller businesses – cement, paint and infrastructure. Are there plans to expand them into sizable businesses?They are small with reference to their contribution to the group because steel is very big as a part of the group. But if I just look at JSW Infrastructure, it is the second-largest private sector port company in India, so it is not small. It has an over 150-million-tonne capacity and they continue to expand. It has a reasonable size and a critical mass. There are plans for that company to go public.Same with JSW Cement, which has a 17-million-tonne capacity and is expanding. They have plans to really grow to a reasonably big size from the current levels and eventually go public.As for JSW Paints, we have started very recently. I think it is doing reasonably well and it will pick up in maybe one or two years. It will be able to establish its brand quite well across India.So which of these companies could hit the market with an initial public offer first? What is the timeline?They have to mature before we go public. We have not decided the time. We will take a call as and when the markets are favourable.Would you consider listing the renewable assets of JSW Energy?No plans to list JSW Energy’s renewable assets separately.JSW Steel cut capital expenditure for FY23 by Rs 5,000 crore. But then JSW Group announced investments of Rs 1 lakh crore each in Odisha and Karnataka. What investment strategy and timelines are you looking at?JSW Steel has announced capex of Rs 48,000 crore where we are expanding our capacities from 27 to 37 million tonnes in India. We are investing in the Odisha mines Rs 3,500 crore as part of this Rs 48,000 crore.So, our reduction in capex in the current financial year is temporary, considering the steep fall in margins and cashflows in the first six months of the financial year. We have just moderated from Rs 20,000 crore capex at the beginning of the year to Rs 15,000 crore. The overall Rs 48,000 crore of capex we have committed for three years is unchanged. We will come back and spend whatever shortfall is there in this year in the next financial year.Your peers like the Vedanta Group and the Tata Group are diversifying into semiconductors. Are you interested in this space?No, as a group we are present in five core sectors of the economy. We are evaluating new businesses, but they’re all at the drawing board stage.How do you plan to manage the group’s debt given the investment plans, especially in an environment where interest rates are likely to remain high. If you look at the overall group EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) versus group debt, we are very comfortable. Each business can stand on its own. A lot of cashflow generation is there within the existing operations. The cashflows without straining the balance sheet, with very comfortable financial ratios, we will be able to expand our businesses. That is how we have structured the entire group’s future growth plans. I don't think that is a concern at all, notwithstanding interest rates which can go up because of inflationary conditions right now. We have structured our plans in a way that our cashflows, combined with the debt we raise in the market, do not strain the balance sheet and we are comfortable with the financial ratios in each business.In each of our verticals, we have communicated the comfortable financial ratios. In JSW Steel, we aim for a 3.75:1 debt-to-EBITDA ratio. We are much less than 3 point something as on September 30th. We have enough room that is available for us to continue to grow our business. It is the same story in each of the verticals.You are a veteran who has seen many commodity cycles and ups and downs in business. Many startups are downsizing and many young entrepreneurs and employees are feeling the heat due to what’s happening in the global economy. Please share your mantra to deal with such turbulence.We are all guided by our founder’s values. Mr. (Sajjan) Jindal always brings agility in the organisation – agility is part of our culture. When a change is happening in the market, you should always accept that change and adapt to it. We have learnt this over a period of time and it is a part of the group’s culture.

India may see 80 startups launch their IPOs in next 5 years: Redseer,13 December,"India may see more than 100 matured, large-scale profitable or on path-to-profitability start-ups in the next five years, said Redseer Strategy Consultants. With about 20 of them already being listed, about 80 start-ups have the potential to look at an IPO journey in the same period, It added.Almost all new-age tech startups that got listed in the last two odd years now trade at a significant discount. The big reason behind this is the global macro situation, as profits are a lot more valuable in the current situation.However, things may be changing, the report added.“Tech companies have now prioritized growth,” said the report by Redseer Strategy Consultants, authored in collaboration with HSBC.The strategy consulting firm said India has significant room for growth in public market cap compared to other countries. This becomes even more pronounced when this is compared to the tech/new age ecosystem.From about $43 trillion market capitalization in the US, about 25 percent can be attributed to tech/new age companies; this includes giants such as Apple, Amazon etc. In India, with about a $3.9 trillion market capitalization, only about 1 percent can be attributed to tech/new age companies.“We are just getting started with the journey of start-ups coming up and going towards their path to profitability, then looking at that public market journey,” said Redseer.Being IPO readyWhile many sectors have suffered in the volatile market this year, the valuation of the tech companies has suffered a bit more than others. Nonetheless, the potential is out there, especially for tech, said Redseer.“There must be a deliberate and goal-based approach to be IPO ready,” says Rohan Agarwal, Partner, Redseer Strategy Consultants. “Whatever the goals may be, you have the time and scope to achieve much better outcomes before the IPO and showcase it strongly.”He said there are a lot of metrics here that the start-up will need to focus on in their IPO journey, including market leadership, clearly visible TAM (total addressable market), moats/multiple use cases, diversified, consumer love, predictable revenues, high operating leverage, achieved sustainable unit economics and a clear path to profitability.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/ipo/india-may-see-80-startups-launch-their-ipos-in-next-5-years-redseer-9697971.html,IPO,"The big reason behind this is the global macro situation, as profits are a lot more valuable in the current situation.However, things may be changing, the report added.“Tech companies have now prioritized growth,” said the report by Redseer Strategy Consultants, authored in collaboration with HSBC.The strategy consulting firm said India has significant room for growth in public market cap compared to other countries.In India, with about a $3.9 trillion market capitalization, only about 1 percent can be attributed to tech/new age companies.“We are just getting started with the journey of start-ups coming up and going towards their path to profitability, then looking at that public market journey,” said Redseer.Being IPO readyWhile many sectors have suffered in the volatile market this year, the valuation of the tech companies has suffered a bit more than others.","['Redseer Strategy Consultants', 'IPO']","['about $43 trillion', '$3.9 trillion']"

Meet Thailand’s top pet food maker floating in Bangkok today,09 December,"I-Tail Corp Pcl (ITC), Thailand’s top pet food maker, climbed on its trading debut after the country’s second-largest initial public offering this year.The pet food manufacturer is a division of Thai Union Group, the largest producer of frozen and seafood goods in the world.Shares of the Bangkok-based company rose as much as 5.5% to trade at 33.75 baht before trimming gains to 32.25 baht as of 10:02 a.m. in Bangkok, reported Bloomberg. The subsidiary raised 21.1 billion baht ($606 million) after selling 660 million shares at 32 baht each, the top of a marketed range. It’s the largest debut in Bangkok since Thai Life Insurance Pcl. in July.According to ITC, it is among the top ten pet food manufacturers worldwide and the number two pet food manufacturer in Asia. ITC specialises in wet pet food that contains fish.Thai Union Group began processing fish more than 40 years ago and soon discovered that the same nutrient-rich fish could be utilised for both human and animal food.The Thai Union pet care division expanded along with the company's customer base. With the addition of emulsified meat chunk and loaf items, the initial fish product line underwent an extension that resulted in a more diverse product line.But in order to become known as a top-tier pet food producer, pet food became the company's only emphasis. As a result, it emerged from Thai Union's shadow and set up a business unit devoted to the production of pet food. According to their corporate website, ""With our meticulously formulated products, we focused on ways to enhance pet health and happiness.""""The global pet food market will continue its strong growth momentum as pet owners are willing to pay a premium price for more functional and nutritious food,"" the company said in a statement.According to its website, ITC offers vitamin drinks for cats and dogs as well as mini-pouch tuna flakes.Thailand's success in pet food exportsDriven by the pandemic, which made people spend more time at home and shift their attitudes toward treating dogs as members of the family, Thailand's exports of pet food began booming.Thailand accounted for 9.7% of the global market for pet food for dogs and cats in 2021, placing third after Germany (12.6%) and the US (9.9%), according to the Bangkok Post.Visit Limlurcha, president of the Thai Future Food Trade Association, said the global pet food market was valued at $94.8 billion in 2021 and is expected to expand at a compound annual growth rate of 4.4% from 2022 to 2030, citing a study by Grand View Research.He also added that edible insects and protein sourced from insects are likely to see strong export potential in the world market given growing global concerns about food security as a result of the serious impact on supply chains caused by the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war.There has been an increase in the demand for pet food in various regions of the world as more people adopted pets in response to a growing need for companionship during lockdowns.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/meet-thailands-top-pet-food-maker-floating-in-bangkok-today-9675651.html,IPO,"I-Tail Corp Pcl (ITC), Thailand’s top pet food maker, climbed on its trading debut after the country’s second-largest initial public offering this year.The pet food manufacturer is a division of Thai Union Group, the largest producer of frozen and seafood goods in the world.Shares of the Bangkok-based company rose as much as 5.5% to trade at 33.75 baht before trimming gains to 32.25 baht as of 10:02 a.m. in Bangkok, reported Bloomberg.""""The global pet food market will continue its strong growth momentum as pet owners are willing to pay a premium price for more functional and nutritious food,"" the company said in a statement.According to its website, ITC offers vitamin drinks for cats and dogs as well as mini-pouch tuna flakes.Thailand's success in pet food exportsDriven by the pandemic, which made people spend more time at home and shift their attitudes toward treating dogs as members of the family, Thailand's exports of pet food began booming.Thailand accounted for 9.7% of the global market for pet food for dogs and cats in 2021, placing third after Germany (12.6%) and the US (9.9%), according to the Bangkok Post.Visit Limlurcha, president of the Thai Future Food Trade Association, said the global pet food market was valued at $94.8 billion in 2021 and is expected to expand at a compound annual growth rate of 4.4% from 2022 to 2030, citing a study by Grand View Research.He also added that edible insects and protein sourced from insects are likely to see strong export potential in the world market given growing global concerns about food security as a result of the serious impact on supply chains caused by the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war.There has been an increase in the demand for pet food in various regions of the world as more people adopted pets in response to a growing need for companionship during lockdowns.","['I-Tail Corp', 'ITC', 'Thai Union Group', 'ITC', 'the Bangkok Post', 'the Thai Future Food Trade Association', 'Grand View Research']","['21.1 billion', '$606 million', '$94.8 billion']"
Snapdeal to shelve $152 million IPO amid tech stocks rout,09 December,"SoftBank-backed Indian e-commerce firm Snapdeal has decided to pull the plug on its $152 million IPO, the company told Reuters, making it the latest casualty of a meltdown in tech stocks that has soured investor sentiment.Snapdeal filed its initial public offering (IPO) regulatory papers for approval in December 2021, a year that saw many stock market debuts and record fund raising by Indian startups. But many are delaying IPOs amid a stock market rout that has raised concerns over frothy tech valuations.Snapdeal, which competes with larger rivals Amazon (AMZN.O) and Walmart's (WMT.N) Flipkart in India's booming e-commerce space, filed a request this week with the country's market regulator SEBI to withdraw its IPO prospectus, said one source with direct knowledge of the matter.""There is no appetite for tech stocks right now,"" said the source, who added that SEBI has been told about the prevailing market conditions and certain other strategic decisions that contributed to the change in IPO plans.In a statement to Reuters, Snapdeal said it has decided to withdraw the IPO prospectus ""considering the prevailing market conditions"", without elaborating. It adding that Snapdeal may reconsider an IPO in future depending on its need for capital and market conditions.New Delhi-based Snapdeal was started in 2010 by Wharton alumnus Kunal Bahl and Indian Institute of Technology graduate Rohit Bansal. The company says it caters to the so-called value e-commerce segment by selling ""value-for-money"", or more affordable products via its shopping website and app.Valued at $6.5 billion in 2016, Snapdeal has seen its popularity dwindle over the years as competition increased. It has recorded losses in the last three financial years between 2019 and 2021, and was hoping to raise new funds via IPO at a valuation of $1 billion.The change of Snapdeal's plans comes as tech stocks in India that listed in recent years face investors' wrath.Shares in Indian digital payments firm Paytm (PAYT.NS), which raised $2.5 billion in one of the country's biggest ever IPOs in November 2021, have plunged 76% since their debut.Food delivery firm Zomato's (ZOMT.NS) shares have halved from their all-time highs after listing in July 2021.In August, TPG and Prosus-funded Indian online pharmcy PharmEasy withdrew papers for its $760 million IPO, while Warburg Pincus-backed seller of wireless earphones, boAT Lifestyle, also withdrew its papers in October.The first source added that Snapdeal's has not decided on any new timeline for when it may refile its IPO.Snapdeal had wanted to fund organic growth initiatives with the proceeds of its IPO, which was set to include a fresh issue of shares worth 12.5 billion rupees ($152 million) and an offer for sale of 30.8 million shares.Investors SoftBank, Sequoia Capital and Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan Board had offered to sell a part of their stakes in the IPO.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/ipo/snapdeal-to-shelve-152-million-ipo-amid-tech-stocks-rout-9675871.html,IPO,"SoftBank-backed Indian e-commerce firm Snapdeal has decided to pull the plug on its $152 million IPO, the company told Reuters, making it the latest casualty of a meltdown in tech stocks that has soured investor sentiment.Snapdeal filed its initial public offering (IPO) regulatory papers for approval in December 2021, a year that saw many stock market debuts and record fund raising by Indian startups.It has recorded losses in the last three financial years between 2019 and 2021, and was hoping to raise new funds via IPO at a valuation of $1 billion.The change of Snapdeal's plans comes as tech stocks in India that listed in recent years face investors' wrath.Shares in Indian digital payments firm Paytm (PAYT.NS), which raised $2.5 billion in one of the country's biggest ever IPOs in November 2021, have plunged 76% since their debut.Food delivery firm Zomato's (ZOMT.NS) shares have halved from their all-time highs after listing in July 2021.In August, TPG and Prosus-funded Indian online pharmcy PharmEasy withdrew papers for its $760 million IPO, while Warburg Pincus-backed seller of wireless earphones, boAT Lifestyle, also withdrew its papers in October.The first source added that Snapdeal's has not decided on any new timeline for when it may refile its IPO.Snapdeal had wanted to fund organic growth initiatives with the proceeds of its IPO, which was set to include a fresh issue of shares worth 12.5 billion rupees ($152 million) and an offer for sale of 30.8 million shares.Investors SoftBank, Sequoia Capital and Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan Board had offered to sell a part of their stakes in the IPO.","['SoftBank', 'Snapdeal', 'IPO', 'Reuters', 'IPO', 'IPO', 'Snapdeal', 'TPG', 'PharmEasy', 'IPO', 'Snapdeal', 'IPO', 'SoftBank', 'Sequoia Capital', ""Ontario Teachers'"", 'Pension Plan Board', 'IPO']","['$152 million', '$6.5 billion', '$1 billion', '$2.5 billion', '$760 million', '12.5 billion rupees', '$152 million']"
Sula Vineyards – India’s largest winemaker – set to hit IPO street on December 12,08 December,"While recession fears have seen new listings grind to a halt this year, one of the few companies currently seeking to go public in Mumbai is testing investor appetite for India’s growing wine market.Sula Vineyards Ltd., which last month filed for an initial public offering, says it has over a 50% share of India’s small but rapidly growing wine market. The 26-year-old company has opened tasting rooms and hosted an annual music festival as part of its effort to make the drink fashionable in a young country with an expanding middle class.“When Sula entered the market, wine was seen as something aspirational -- for people above 45 years of age,” said Abhay Kewadkar, an independent alcoholic beverage consultant. “They cleverly changed that perspective by targeting younger consumers.”The winemaker is looking to go public at a time when IPOs have dried up in India, as in much of the world, amid concerns of a recession. Young retail traders who helped drive the local stock market over the past couple years have been burned in recent months by plunges in high-flying tech unicorns such as Zomato Ltd. and Paytm parent One 97 Communications Ltd.The S&P BSE IPO Index, a gauge tracking the performance of Indian shares for the first two years after listing, has fallen 24% so far in 2022 after nearly tripling in the previous three years.Sula plans sale of about a third of its existing equity, including shares held by founder and Managing Director Rajeev Samant. The company posted sales of $57 million for the year ended March 31, around a tenth of the revenue at Zomato and Paytm, though unlike the two tech firms Sula is profitable.In its draft prospectus, Sula claims that India is the world’s third-largest market for alcoholic beverages, at $33 billion in 2020, but wine only accounts for 1%. The company believes this allows much room for growth, projecting total Indian sales of 3.4 million cases of wine in 2025, up 70% from the level in 2021.Samant, a 55-year-old Stanford graduate, has worked to boost demand by promoting wine tourism in Sula’s production base of Nashik, which is seen as India’s version of Napa Valley. The company says social media has also helped lift the beverage’s profile, and claims Sula is among the top 10 most-followed vineyards on Instagram globally.Sula will raise no money from the IPO itself, but hopes the listing will boost its visibility and brand image. It could also have a halo effect for the whole industry, with the company’s local competitors including unlisted Fratelli Wines and Grover Zampa Vineyards.“This IPO will bring the wine segment into the limelight,” said Ronak Soni, analyst at Equirus Securities Pvt. “It’s a fast-growing segment.”",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/ipo/sula-vineyards-indias-largest-winemaker-set-to-hit-ipo-street-on-december-12-9670001.html,IPO,"Young retail traders who helped drive the local stock market over the past couple years have been burned in recent months by plunges in high-flying tech unicorns such as Zomato Ltd. and Paytm parent One 97 Communications Ltd.The S&P BSE IPO Index, a gauge tracking the performance of Indian shares for the first two years after listing, has fallen 24% so far in 2022 after nearly tripling in the previous three years.Sula plans sale of about a third of its existing equity, including shares held by founder and Managing Director Rajeev Samant.The company posted sales of $57 million for the year ended March 31, around a tenth of the revenue at Zomato and Paytm, though unlike the two tech firms Sula is profitable.In its draft prospectus, Sula claims that India is the world’s third-largest market for alcoholic beverages, at $33 billion in 2020, but wine only accounts for 1%.","['Zomato Ltd.', 'Paytm', '97 Communications Ltd.', 'IPO']","['$57 million', '$33 billion']"
It takes 5 minutes for Shankar Sharma to hitch a ride on market-bound drone startup,08 December,"It did not take marquee investor Shankar Sharma more than five minutes to decide on buying a stake in IPO-bound drone startup Droneacharya Aerial Innovations, its founder said.""Sharma is a giant, a behemoth in the industry. But surprisingly, all it took for us was five minutes. This happened when I was in Dubai, where we happened to meet,"" Prateek Srivastava, who is also Chief Executive Officer of the Pune-based company, told Moneycontrol.In the pre-IPO funding round, investors led by Sharma and others including Harshal Mode, an angel investor in media and entertainment-focused startups, and Ashish Nanda, founder and managing director of Innovations Group, a UAE-based conglomerate, bought a minority stake in the company.""He (Sharma) has always been very bullish about EVs (Electric Vehicles) and green energy. Looking at my prior history, and the tailwind that the drone industry is currently getting, it was a very quick decision for him,"" Srivastava said.""In hindsight, maybe he wanted to get into this industry, and with us it just clicked,"" he added.Sharma said, """"Drones are being widely used in the country across industries for surveys, deliveries and surveillance, and this segment is expected to perform strongly in the coming years. We see a great value creation as the company has within a very short span been able to scale up its operations and has dynamic plans ahead.""Srivastava has around 16 years of experience in the geospatial industry and he was earlier CEO of Japan-based Terra Drone's Indian unit, Terra Drone India.The company's December 13 - 15 initial public offering (IPO) of shares will be priced between Rs 52 and Rs.54 apiece. Of the 6.29 million shares on offer, 898,000 are reserved for high net worth individuals (HNI), 1.194 million for qualified institutional buyers (QIB) and 2.092 million for retail investors.Financial security The main reason for the IPO, according to Srivastava, is to ensure that the startup is secured from unprecedented and unforeseen events like COVID-19.""We want a future-proof or a pandemic- proof business strategy. Many startups were swept away in India during COVID-19. One of the major reasons was lack of money,"" Srivastava said.Other than that, Droneacharya also has plans to expand domestically and internationally, and bolster its manufacturing capabilities.The seven-year-old startup has offerings in the drone services industry and in training and education, which Srivastava pointed out, makes up the largest share in the startup's revenue.""There are around 25-30 Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA)-certified drone training organisations in the country. And only around 5-6 are active right now,"" Srivastava said.Need for drone pilots The startup has 12 courses in its drone pilot training program, and more than 600 people have been trained and placed in jobs, he said. Out of them, 225 to 230 are DGCA-certified pilots, he added.Srivastava is banking on growing demand for drone pilots in the future as a source of more revenue.""Currently, there is a need of around 100,000 pilots. And in three years, as Civil Aviation Minister (Jyotiraditya Scindia) had said, India would need 10 lakh pilots,"" he said.""Currently we have a market cap of around 30 percent. Every third person in the country (drone pilot) is a Droneacharya product. In the future, we are aiming to increase that share to 50 percent -- every second person in the drone industry should be a Droneacharya product,"" he added.Droneacharya's training courses cost around Rs 55,000 and last for around a month.""This is one course which has the fastest ROI (Return On Investment) possible. It is less than a month. The training course has a validity of 10 years, and you can land a job for at least Rs 35,000 to Rs 40,000 a month,"" Srivastava explained.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/ipo-bound-drone-startup-had-shankar-sharmas-backing-after-a-5-minute-meeting-9663771.html,IPO,"This happened when I was in Dubai, where we happened to meet,"" Prateek Srivastava, who is also Chief Executive Officer of the Pune-based company, told Moneycontrol.In the pre-IPO funding round, investors led by Sharma and others including Harshal Mode, an angel investor in media and entertainment-focused startups, and Ashish Nanda, founder and managing director of Innovations Group, a UAE-based conglomerate, bought a minority stake in the company.One of the major reasons was lack of money,"" Srivastava said.Other than that, Droneacharya also has plans to expand domestically and internationally, and bolster its manufacturing capabilities.The seven-year-old startup has offerings in the drone services industry and in training and education, which Srivastava pointed out, makes up the largest share in the startup's revenue.","['Moneycontrol', 'Innovations Group', 'Srivastava']",[]

Further, it has dealership agreements with international brands such as Le Grand Noir, Hardys, Beluga Vodka etc., to distribute imported wine and other core spirits in India.

Consequently, the cost of transacting in a depository environment is considerably lower than the earlier method of transacting in certificates.According to data released by NSDL and CDSL, the number of demat accounts in India crossed the 100 million mark for the first time in August 2022. From 40.9 million accounts in March 2020 (before the nationwide outbreak of Covid-19), the figure surged to 100.5 million.Also Read: NSDL | Ushering India’s stock market through the digital era for 25 years",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/nsdl-indias-first-depository-kicks-off-2023-ipo-plans-idbi-bank-nse-may-sell-stake-9654671.html,IPO,"National Securities Depository Limited (NSDL), the country’s oldest depository services firm, which revamped the Indian securities market by facilitating the holding and transfer of securities in dematerialised form, has kicked off plans to launch an initial public offer (IPO) in 2023, multiple industry sources with knowledge of the matter told Moneycontrol.On August 30, Moneycontrol was the first to report that NSDL, which is backed by the likes of IDBI Bank and NSE, would pick seven investment banks for the proposed listing, namely ICICI Securities, Axis Capital, HSBC Securities, Motilal Oswal Investment Advisors, SBI Capital, HFC Bank and IDBI Capital.“The kick-off for the NSDL IPO happened last week.Its stock has risen by 5.2 percent in the last six months.Recently, NSDL acquired a 5.6 percent stake in the government-backed ONDC (Open Network for Digital Commerce).Also read: NSDL acquires 5.6% stake in ONDCA CLOSER LOOK AT THE NSDL UNIVERSEEstablished in 1996, NSDL, which is led by MD and CEO Padmaja Chunduru, provides a bouquet of services to investors, stockbrokers, custodians and issuer companies through its nationwide network of Depository Partners.According to the firm’s website, as of October 31, 2022, NSDL had 2,95,58,112 active investor accounts, 58,519 DP service centres and Rs 320.09 lakh crore of demat custody value.The market share of NSDL in value of demat assets is more than 89 percent and its demat account holders are present in more than 99 percent of pin codes in the country and 189 countries across the globe.","['National Securities Depository Limited', 'IPO', 'Moneycontrol', 'NSDL', 'IDBI Bank', 'NSE', 'ICICI Securities', 'Axis Capital', 'HSBC Securities', 'SBI Capital', 'HFC Bank', 'IDBI Capital', 'IPO', 'NSDL', 'Digital', 'NSDL', 'Depository Partners', 'NSDL', 'NSDL']",[]

Keystone Realtors MD Boman Rustomi Irani says more room for good competition promising quality growth post D-Street debut,24 November,"In an interview with CNBC Tv-18 on November 24, Boman Rustom Irani, Chairman & MD, Keystone Realtors spoke about the company's stock market debut. The stock got listed at Rs 555 per share and was up about 2.5 percent from its issue price of Rs 541.Talking about the company's journey and the positive response the Mumbai-based realtor received, Irani thanked Keystone's investors and spoke at length about the company's plans for the redevelopment of Mumbai and the Mumbai Metropolitan Region(MMR).Edited excerpts from the interview:Before the listing you said that you're not looking to get out of the Mumbai markets anytime soon, but with competition coming through, especially in the affordable segment such as players from down south increasing their presence in Mumbai, would you consider expanding geographically?Mumbai is one of the largest markets in the country at this moment . There are many good developers already existent out here, and there are plenty of developers who wish to come into this market and make it a stronghold for themselves. I think this market has ample room for all of us to grow our base out here.More importantly, what we've seen over the last ten years is that this business has become more and more organized. And we have a lot of larger listed or branded players who continue to grow their market share, whereas for the smaller developers and non-organized developers, the market share, at least as far as the customer point of view is concerned, has reduced.This only means that there's a lot more room available for us and all the good competition that comes into the city. The city brings out the best and Mumbai Metro Area brings out the best in most of us. And I wish that the best will continue to grow.The company had a Rs 1,200 crore debt at some point. Could you give us an updated number for the debt in the books and tell us where is it headed?It's been a 26 year journey where we've been to the school of hard knocks, learnt a lot of lessons. We grew a lot with our debt that we took at one point of time until we realized that debt was very good as a short term friend, not very good in the long run.This year, I think the debt you're talking about, the secured debt that we had on our books, was about Rs 901 crores, and we plan to bring it down to Rs 560 crores with the amounts raised through our listing itself. This will allow us to further to maintain a one to one debt to equity ratio to maintain it healthy, and this would allow us to continually grow our development in Mumbai and MMR.And as we are all aware we at Rustamji have been doing redevelopment since 2003, and we have very many redevelopments that we've completed more than 1400 plus redeveloped homes.And today, the city, needs sprucing up, it needs a younger creation of newer buildings, better lifestyle for our residents. And I see the government doing that hugely in terms of the infrastructure that they are building. With the kind of money that we've raised, we're looking at putting a lot into growth, and that's our plan for the future. We plan to stay in Mumbai and MMR for redevelopments,for joint developments, joint ventures with partners.What are margins at right now and how do you see it tracking from here on? Rustomji, is a well known brand in Mumbai and MMR. So why not use that as a go to brand of the market or are there any limitations?I'd like to just say that Mumbai and MMR will continue to be our mainstay. We will continue to be here.  I will talk about Rustamji's investment philosophy. We normally do not invest more than 10 percent of the gross revenues of the project till we are go to market. When I say go to market, it means that we are ready for sales. And the time that we try to do this in about a year's time of clocking a project in because approvals, etc. are there. And we work on 35 percent gross margins for most of the projects that we enter. We enter in a project only if it's got 35% plus gross margins going forward.If you look at the last four years, your annual trajectory has gone up from almost Rs 1,000 crores in FY 20 to Rs 2,600 crores at the end of FY 22 in terms of pre-sales. How much do you think on an average, could the growth be for you given your launch pipeline?I'm not sure I'm at liberty to speak about numbers in actuality. All I can say is that our growth trajectory has been phenomenal given the post Covid buying that took place, and of course the support that came in from the RBI by reducing of interest rates at the same point of time by the government of Maharashtra, by  reducing stamp duty, really helped a lot. So, this led to a lot of very good buying in the last few years. I think we will continue to grow at probably healthy margins.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/ipo/keystone-realtors-md-boman-rustomi-irani-says-more-room-for-good-competition-promising-quality-growth-post-d-street-debut-9592871.html,IPO,"The stock got listed at Rs 555 per share and was up about 2.5 percent from its issue price of Rs 541.Talking about the company's journey and the positive response the Mumbai-based realtor received, Irani thanked Keystone's investors and spoke at length about the company's plans for the redevelopment of Mumbai and the Mumbai Metropolitan Region(MMR).Edited excerpts from the interview:Before the listing you said that you're not looking to get out of the Mumbai markets anytime soon, but with competition coming through, especially in the affordable segment such as players from down south increasing their presence in Mumbai, would you consider expanding geographically?Mumbai is one of the largest markets in the country at this moment .We grew a lot with our debt that we took at one point of time until we realized that debt was very good as a short term friend, not very good in the long run.This year, I think the debt you're talking about, the secured debt that we had on our books, was about Rs 901 crores, and we plan to bring it down to Rs 560 crores with the amounts raised through our listing itself.","['Keystone', 'the Mumbai Metropolitan']",[]
Keystone's modest debut: Does Street find value here?,24 November,"Keystone Realtors, a real estate developer associated with the Rustomjee brand, saw a tepid listing on November 24 on the back of the muted response to its maiden public issue and expected underperformance of the realty space amid rising interest rates on home loans that may hit demand.The issue listed at a 2.6 percent premium to its issue price of Rs 541 per share. The initial public offering (IPO) was subscribed just 2.01 times during November 14-16, backed by qualified institutional buyers (QIBs) and high net-worth individuals (HNIs).However, analysts are not that worried by the lack of retail investor response. They believe the company may have short-term challenges but there are enough positives, including a renowned brand, that make it a candidate for long-term play.There is a precedent for their conviction as well. Last year, Macrotech Developers—which operates another renowned brand in Mumbai, Lodha—was also shunned by retail IPO investors initially but surprised the market with outperformance in the next few months.“We may not simply assume the same kind of mirroring performance in Keystone Realtors (Rustomjee) but remain optimistic only for the long term,” said Prashanth Tapse, senior vice-president, research, Mehta Equities, a Mumbai-based online brokerage. “Considering the growth prospects with projects in hand and also considering that we expect the Indian real estate sector to do well in the next two-three years, we remain optimistic on Rustomjee.”After debuting in April 2021, the Macrotech stock had tripled from its listing price by the end of the year. However, it has seen some selling since but still trades at a significant upside from the IPO price.Narendra Solanki, head, equity research at Anand Rathi Share and Stock Brokers, said Keystone has become one of the prominent real estate developers in the micro markets it is present in.“It has a diversified suite of projects across a wide range of price points, and a presence in several micro markets. Keystone has developed a strong brand that has encouraged stakeholders in the real estate development industry to prefer partnering with the company. We understand investors should hold Kaynes in the portfolio with a medium- to long-term perspective.”The company has a good financial track record and has generated profits in the past three years with a diverse category of projects in hand. As of June 2022, Keystone had completed 32 projects, with 12 ongoing projects and 21 forthcoming projects across the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) under the Rustomjee brand.One negative about the stock is its valuation. According to analysts, it commands a price-earnings multiple of 44 times its last 12 months’ earnings at the upper end of the price band.“The IPO price band is a bit expensive,” said Ravi Singh, vice-president and head of research, Share India, another Mumbai-based online broking firm, adding, however, that the company has a good financial track and project record. He advised investors to hold their positions from a long-term perspective.“Allottees who applied for the public offering for listing premium are advised to maintain their stop-loss at Rs 545 and wait for further upside, whereas those who have a medium- to long-term perspective can hold the stock and maintain their stop-loss at Rs 510,” said Pravesh Gour, senior technical analyst, Swastika Investmart, an investment advisory platform.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

They have also advise investors to exit their investments and refrain from buying more.The stock listed at a discount of about 8 percent to its issue price of Rs 65 per share. As of 10.25 am, it recovered slightly to Rs 61.15 on BSE, still down 6 percent from the issue price.“The top line for Inox Green has remained quite stable for the last three fiscals but the bottom-line is under pressure due to high leverage in its balance sheet,” said Narendra Solanki, Head- Equity Research, Anand Rathi Shares & Stock Brokers. “In the rising interest rate scenario, we believe profitability will be impacted in the near term and we recommended to those investors who were allotted issues to exit on listing day.”The initial public offering (IPO) had seen a muted response from investors despite positive trends in the broader market, with the overall offer being subscribed 1.55 times. The success of the IPO was largely because of 4.7 times subscription from retail investors, who are now sitting on losses. The portion of shares reserved for high net-worth individuals was undersubscribed.“We advise allotted investors should look for booking profits or exit on listing day and look for better opportunities in the other listed space,” said Prashanth Tapse, Sr VP - Research, Mehta Equities.The company has presence in Gujarat, Rajasthan, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Kerala and Tamil Nadu. It provides exclusive operation and maintenance services for all wind turbine generators (WTG) sold by Inox Wind through long-term operation and maintenance (O&M) contracts between the WTG purchaser and Inox Wind.The company has plans to grow into a more asset-light business model.

Tea cafe chain Chai Point aims for IPO in 18-24 months,23 November,"Bengaluru-based tea cafe chain Chai Point plans to launch its initial public offering (IPO) in the next 18-24 months and is banking on its brewing systems through which it is unlocking new partnerships, as the segment sees soaring competition with an increasing number of players.“Over the last one-and-a-half years, we have invested a lot in technology, building the brewing machines as we are driving for profitability. The goal is to list the company in about 18-24 months,” Amuleek Singh Bijral, Co-founder and CEO of Chai Point, told Moneycontrol.In the last few years, the chain has started focusing on manufacturing its own brewing machines, and has so far installed 5,000 machines across 19 cities in the country through its business-to-business-to- consumer (B2B2C) channel. The company, which was launched in 2010, operates 180 retail outlets in nine cities.Apart from its retail outlets, Chai Point now has different sets of clientele grouped under corporates, third-party retail outlets and separately also sells packaged goods via marketplaces as well as its own outlets.To third-party retail outlets, it offers them branding of ‘My Chai Corner’, leases the machine and its processes, and the consumables, which are procured by the third-party outlet through Chai Point’s platform. Bijral says this will help in wide expansion of their footprint while controlling quality, and all third-party outlets under this My Chai Corner will be collated on one app.“You can imagine us as becoming the OYO of chai,” Bijral explained.These brewing systems are what he believes will help them scale. “While the brand vector will be our Chai Point stores, brewing machines will be our scale vector. The goal is to achieve arms reach convenience (ARC).”When asked how this brewing system is different from coffee machines seen in many offices, the CEO says that these come with an Android software where all aspects of how a consumer prefers her/her tea can be customised once through the app and then saved for the future to ensure consistency.These machines are also being deployed in corporates like Intel, Microsoft, VMware and Amazon. Currently, corporates contribute around 40 percent to the business, while retail stands at 57 percent.Bijral added that consumption is back to pre-Covid levels in cities like Mumbai, Chennai and Delhi. In Bengaluru, tech parks and a few other pockets are not yet back to the same level.Bengaluru, however, continues to be Chai Point’s biggest market, followed by NCR.Competitive landscapeOn the growing competitive landscape, Bijral said, “Competition is not only in technology, but also in the assurance of quality and consistency at scale. It is not just the brewing system, but also the software that is required to manage it. It requires maintenance, ingredients, hygiene, availability.”While Chai Point has entered the coffee market as well with filter coffee and bean-to-cup offerings, Bijral says though there are competitors in various lines of offerings, there is no single comprehensive player.To put it into perspective, on the storefront, Chai Point currently competes with players like Chaayos, Starbucks, Cafe Coffee Day and Hatti Kaapi on the retail front, along with smaller standalone players. On the corporate front, it is competing with Coffee Day and Lavazza as they deploy machines in corporate offices.“The ecosystem that needs to be built around this brewing machine takes time. We have a lot of competition on our storefront, but when it comes to the strategy of brewing systems, it thins down. The strategy of giving it to the third-party and aggregating is not something that is being pursued by others.”Till date, Chai Point has raised around $55 million from investors like Saama Capital, and Eight Roads Ventures, among others. The last available financials for Chai Point are for FY21, when business was impacted by the pandemic. For FY21, its losses jumped to Rs 78.5 crore from Rs 47.7 crore in FY20, while operating revenue was down to Rs 55.7 crore from Rs 189 crore the preceding year.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/startup/tea-cafe-chain-chai-point-aims-for-ipo-in-18-24-months-9582591.html,IPO,"Bengaluru-based tea cafe chain Chai Point plans to launch its initial public offering (IPO) in the next 18-24 months and is banking on its brewing systems through which it is unlocking new partnerships, as the segment sees soaring competition with an increasing number of players.“Over the last one-and-a-half years, we have invested a lot in technology, building the brewing machines as we are driving for profitability.The company, which was launched in 2010, operates 180 retail outlets in nine cities.Apart from its retail outlets, Chai Point now has different sets of clientele grouped under corporates, third-party retail outlets and separately also sells packaged goods via marketplaces as well as its own outlets.To third-party retail outlets, it offers them branding of ‘My Chai Corner’, leases the machine and its processes, and the consumables, which are procured by the third-party outlet through Chai Point’s platform.",['IPO'],['around $55 million']

"Five Star Finance eyes Rs 7,000 crore in assets under management by FY23-end",22 November,"Thirty-eight years after its inception, Five Star Finance listed on the stock exchanges on Monday, November 21, albeit at a discount of 5 percent to its issue price of Rs 474 per share.A traditional non-banking financial company (NBFC) offering secured loans to small and medium businesses, Five Star Finance was backed by marquee venture capital firms including Sequoia Capital and Matrix Partners, private equity firms Norwest and TPG, all of whom exited through the initial public offering (IPO).In an interview with Moneycontrol, the company’s chief executive officer Rangarajan Krishnan and chief financial officer Srikanth Gopalakrishnan said they remain confident of the NBFCs growth prospects despite the threat of a global recession and high-interest rate fears.Krishnan detailed the company’s growth levers, which include expanding its branch network, increasing the ticket size of loans offered and strengthening its technological capabilities.By the end of FY23, the company’s assets under management (AUM) are expected to grow to Rs 7,000 crore from Rs 5,300 crore at the end of the quarter ended June 30, 2022, said Gopalakrishnan.Five Star Business Finance recorded a profit of Rs 453.5 crore for the financial year ended March 2022, up from Rs 359 crore in previous year and Rs 262 crore in FY20. As of 30 June, 2022, the company’s gross non-performing asset (NPA) ratio was at 1.12 percent while the net NPA ratio was at 0.68 percent.Edited excerpts from the interview:How do you feel now that you have made the transition to being a listed company?Rangarajan Krishnan: We have been in existence for more than 30 years now. So the ambition to become listed is a very well thought out decision which we have taken over a long period of time. We have been preparing ourselves not just in terms of financials and numbers, but also in terms of governance in terms of the board, in terms of management. We have done a whole host of stuff for the last five years to get to this point. So I think it is definitely fantastic to finally being listed today.How do you look at the sense of responsibility that will kick in? Do you fear this sense of responsibility?Krishnan: One hundred percent. The decision to get listed wasn’t taken overnight. We have been preparing for this well over the last three to four years. So I think there’s a lot of sense of responsibility because for the first time public shareholders are coming into our focus. But we are very confident with the rate at which we have grown and the systems that we have built so far, the governance metrics that we have put in place, and we are confident of delivering the best, across the board.You have listed in a bear market. Was that a worry for you? Were you nervous about how investors would react to the IPO? Srikanth Gopalakrishnan: We had more than six investors on board (before the IPO). So this was a collective call that we had to take in terms of both getting listed and the timing of this thing. The markets, as you rightly pointed out, are choppy but you can’t really time the market to perfection across various parameters.Our confidence of, you know, getting past the line and making sure that we are forming a fundamentally good listed company arises from the good fundamentals that we are carrying. From that perspective, our investors have always been supportive, and they are very confident with the way we have delivered our results, consistently over a long period of time now.What is your growth plan when it comes to AUMs? Gopalakrishnan: At the end of the June 30, 2022, quarter, we were at Rs 5,300 crore of AUMs. For the September quarter, i.e. Q2FY23, the AUM number should be over Rs 5,700 crore. In the last couple of years, we have been a little cautious in terms of growth. During COVID-19 our focus was more on collections, and we gave growth a little bit of a back seat.Historically, we have been growing at a swift pace. We believe that we should be growing at about 45 percent CAGR (compound annual growth rate) in the next three to four years. Which would typically mean, I think, for this year (FY23), we should be close to Rs 7,000 crore of AUMs.What impact did COVID-19 have on your business and by when do you expect demand to bounce back to pre-COVID levels?Gopalakrishnan: Demand was never the issue. We consciously went on the back foot in terms of growth because things were uncertain over the last two years. There’s no point in just focusing on disbursing. Asset quality is of paramount importance.So, it was a conscious call to have reduced growth to an extent, but I think in the last 12 months, we opened almost close to 80 branches. Because that kind of confidence comes to you from the strong demand, the green shoots that you see on the ground. It’s really picking up and I think we should get to record levels quite soon.What are your expansion plans in terms of setting up new branches and also in terms of geographies within the country? Currently, you are focused on the South, do you see that mix changing in the near future?Krishnan: On the branch expansion part, we are confident of putting up 50 to 60 branches every year. Because we are also cautious, we don’t want to put in too many branches that you are not able to get ahead in terms of culture and performance. So 50 to 60 is a comfortable number that we have been doing consistently even during pre-COVID times.We will continue to remain focused on South Indian states extremely strongly because that is where our strength comes from. We have more than three decades of experience operating in the South. Our understanding of the market, the teams we have built, the infrastructure, the leadership teams across all the states… At the end of the day, it’s a very localised business so unless you have strong teams on the ground, you will not have the confidence to expand really fast. So South is where our heart is, South is where our confidence lies and for the foreseeable future, I think we will definitely be dominated by South.We will continue to invest in the central states like Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, we also have plans to enter one or two neighbourhood states from here, but I think these are for learning, it’s not going to be a rapid expansion in these states. We will take our time to settle down, understand the realities of the metrics before pressing the button on those states. But I think in about three to five years or beyond that, these regions will become important for us.Will you look at reducing your lending rates in the near future? Will that have any impact on your margins?Gopalakrishnan: In 2020, our borrowing cost was 11.4 percent. However, in the first six months of FY23, we raised money at 8.6 percent. So we have seen close to 3 percentage points reduction in borrowing costs. Yes, the interest rate cycle has taken a different turn so our borrowing costs will also go up.In an ideal scenario, we would have passed some of these benefits to our borrowers. Given that we don’t know how the situation will shape up, we are playing a wait-and-watch game. There is a definite headroom available for us to pass on some of these benefits to the borrower. Once the interest rate settles, we will take a measured call in terms of passing on some of these benefits to borrowers. We are also hopeful of some rating upgrades in the next few quarters. With that we feel confident that we should be able to give at least 100-200 basis points of benefits to our borrowers over the next few quarters.You are operating in a very competitive space. Moreover, a number of new players offering unsecured loans have seen tremendous growth post the pandemic. How do you see that impacting your growth?Krishnan: Competition will definitely come up over the years. But we are specialists in what we do. Our branches are largely in between tier III and VI markets. We are not there in tier I, tier II and metros. So the penetration of a lot of other players is not as high in markets between tier III and tier VI cities and towns. Secondly, most fintechs are largely focusing on smaller-ticket, smaller-tenor loans, while we take a fairly long-term call on our clients and we go up to seven years. That confidence on a long-term call on our client profile comes from the deep work that we do from an underwriting perspective. However, there is a lot of room for many other companies to serve (this client base).How does the company plan to invest further for growth and expansion? Considering the proceeds of the IPO have fully been dedicated to investors who exited...Krishnan: The reason why the IPO proceeds are not being used in the business is because we are very well capitalised. Secondly, we are a profit-making company. So that gives us enough room to invest in the future. In the future there are three levers of growth that we will have. Firstly, we will continue to invest in and open new branches. In the last 12 months we have already opened 80 branches.We will also continue to put more people in each of those branches, because it’s far easier to penetrate geographies where you are already well-established, rather than putting in new branches. Lastly, our growth, to an extent, will also come from a little bit of ticket size increases in line with inflation and customer requirements. We will also invest strongly in technology. Technology adoption is a key requirement for any business, more so for lending businesses now. We have identified a number of areas where there can be a strong technology investment. We have been fairly consistent in doing that over the last few years.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/ipo/five-star-finance-eyes-rs-7000-crore-in-assets-under-management-by-fy23-end-9575431.html,IPO,"Thirty-eight years after its inception, Five Star Finance listed on the stock exchanges on Monday, November 21, albeit at a discount of 5 percent to its issue price of Rs 474 per share.A traditional non-banking financial company (NBFC) offering secured loans to small and medium businesses, Five Star Finance was backed by marquee venture capital firms including Sequoia Capital and Matrix Partners, private equity firms Norwest and TPG, all of whom exited through the initial public offering (IPO).In an interview with Moneycontrol, the company’s chief executive officer Rangarajan Krishnan and chief financial officer Srikanth Gopalakrishnan said they remain confident of the NBFCs growth prospects despite the threat of a global recession and high-interest rate fears.Krishnan detailed the company’s growth levers, which include expanding its branch network, increasing the ticket size of loans offered and strengthening its technological capabilities.By the end of FY23, the company’s assets under management (AUM) are expected to grow to Rs 7,000 crore from Rs 5,300 crore at the end of the quarter ended June 30, 2022, said Gopalakrishnan.Five Star Business Finance recorded a profit of Rs 453.5 crore for the financial year ended March 2022, up from Rs 359 crore in previous year and Rs 262 crore in FY20.Our understanding of the market, the teams we have built, the infrastructure, the leadership teams across all the states… At the end of the day, it’s a very localised business so unless you have strong teams on the ground, you will not have the confidence to expand really fast.","['Five Star Finance', 'Five Star Finance', 'Sequoia Capital and Matrix Partners', 'Norwest', 'TPG', 'Moneycontrol', 'Krishnan', 'AUM', 'Five Star Business Finance']",[]

"Archean Chemical debuts with double-digit premium. Should you buy, sell or hold the stock?",21 November,"Even as speciality chemical maker Archean Chemical Industries listed barely with a double-digit premium over the issue price, analysts believe this stock has the potential to become a long-term compounder.On its debut, the stock listed at 10 percent premium to its issue price of Rs 407 per share. The stock traded at Rs 450 apiece on the NSE and Rs 449 on the BSE.“Healthy premium listing is justified on the back of reasonable valuations for a fancy demand in specialty chemicals sectors which is well supported by China plus one strategy ushering resilient growth with unlimited export opportunity in the long run,” said Narendra Solanki, Head of Equity Research at Anand Rathi Shares & Stock Brokers.“We are optimistic on the Indian speciality space and believe Archean Chemical will do well in the long term as the industry is getting bigger and bigger.”Archean Chemical Industries is one of the leading specialty marine chemical manufacturers in India and the largest exporter of bromine and industrial salt.

Fusion Micro Finance disappoints on debut: Should you buy on dips?,15 November,"Fusion Micro Finance had a disappointing debut, with the stock listing at a discount on November 15 and falling further amid declining margins and fear of possible bad loans.Analysts believe this stock is only for high-risk and the most patient investors as there are a number of risks plaguing the company in the short term.Satish Kumar, research analyst at Choice Broking, said the company sold its shares at an expensive valuation even when risks to the microfinance sector were higher amid elevated inflation.“Return ratios of the firm remained depressed due to higher credit cost. Thereby, any unexpected shock on the credit cost front may weigh on return ratios heavily,” Kumar said. Investors who have been allotted the shares should book profit, he said.The stock opened at a 2.3 percent discount against the issue price of Rs 368.

Its business runs on a joint liability group-lending model, wherein a small number of women form a group and guarantee one another’s loans.The company has a strong focus on rural areas with a well-diversified and extensive pan-India presence.Due to its business model, risks can also be relatively higher in times of higher inflation when economically weaker families are hit the hardest.Prashanth Tapse, senior vice-president (research), Mehta Equities, also advised allotted investors to book profits and look for better opportunities in the other listed NBFCs.During the book building, the issue received a muted response from investors on both the institutional as well as the retail sides.

It’s set to be the biggest Saudi IPO this year and will value Americana at as much as $6 billion.The company will be the first to have shares traded in both the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia, where the Tadawul stock exchange has for years been encouraging firms to dual list. The deal is being closely watched as it will set a precedent for other regional businesses to list their shares on the two exchanges.Americana is part of a late-year rush of IPOs in the Middle East that has emerged as a bright spot in an otherwise grim market for listings globally, with proceeds down significantly from last year because of high inflation and hawkish central banks. The region accounts for almost half of the IPO volumes in Europe, the Middle East and Africa this year.Diversification via IPOsA surge in oil prices through 2021 and the early months of this year, coupled with a rotation by investors into the region following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, have helped underpin IPOs.

Saudi Arabia working with Lazard on funding options and IPO of Mecca mega project,11 November,"Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF) is working with Lazard (LAZ.N) on funding options and a potential initial public offering of Masar, a $27 billion mega project in the holy city of Mecca, two sources with direct knowledge told Reuters.The kingdom's sovereign wealth fund, which has over $600 billion in assets, is working with the U.S. financial advisory on Masar, and several other projects including the $500 billion economic zone NEOM, said the sources, declining to be named as the matter was not public.The PIF, Lazard and Masar did not respond to a Reuters query for comment.Bloomberg first reported Lazard was advising the sovereign wealth fund on NEOM.Lazard has been scouting for deals in the kingdom ever since it poached Citigroup Saudi Arabia's chief executive Wassim Al-Khatib, who played a key role in Aramco's record $29.4 billion initial public offering in 2019.Masar's

Rustomjee: A rising Mumbai developer hits the stock market ,10 November,"Over a decade ago three builders were slugging it out for a large parcel of land close to the business hub of Bandra Kurla Complex in Mumbai.The land had many small old buildings where apartment owners organized themselves and engaged with builders for redevelopment.Small old buildings were to go and tall new buildings were to come up. Two of the three builders were heavyweights. Presentations and bids were to be made. One heavyweight remarked to the owners: “You are asking me, the best developer in Mumbai, to make a presentation to you?”The other heavyweight found the expectations of apartment owners to be inflated and folded. The third builder was a middle-aged Parsi man with a modest development record. He cajoled, charmed, acted nimbly and won a land parcel that would later be worth its weight in gold as Mumbai’s economic geography moved northwards.The name of the developer was Rustomjee and that entrepreneur was Boman Irani.A worthy trade-off Since then, the handsome man has aged rapidly. But it appears to have been a worthy trade-off given the business growth. Before the end of November 2022, that real estate company would be listed on India’s stock exchanges at a market value of Rs. 5,600 crore.A large part of that valuation can be attributed to the skill Rustomjee has demonstrated in positioning itself as a reliable and even-handed partner.The original journey began in 1996-97. A project named Residency was to be launched. Boman Irani’s, mother, however refused to show up for the launch.She wanted a symbolic involvement of her late husband in the project. After the initial resistance, the young Parsi entrepreneur lost. The mother’s wish prevailed. The project was renamed Rustomjee Residency after his father Rustom. Rustomjee was born.Punching above its weight The journey continued with respectable projects but nothing earth-shattering. The builder, however, punched above its weight in the consumer mind-space because Boman (and especially his brother Percy) understood the value of branding ahead of their competitors.Thus, the elevated image of the company in public consciousness was inversely proportional to its negligible business size.The one man who would change the world for players like Rustomjee was former Municipal Commissioner Subodh Kumar. In a short tenure in 2012, he disrupted the industry with revised norms that later provided disciplined and clinical players an edge.Rustomjee was then to be the right person at the right place at the right time. While the crooks and manipulators had been put on the backfoot through regulations, the legacy builders were still in the mindset of dealing from a pedestal with all other stakeholders.Dealing as an equal Rustomjee dealing as an equal with other stakeholders was a refreshing change. That became the company’s Unique Selling Proposition (USP) in cornering the redevelopment game (from SRA, or Slum Rehabilitation Authority, to society redevelopment) where persuading several players was a critical component.That’s the part where relationship building and nurturing matters, which Boman Irani appears to have mastered – most with strong results and a few with weak results. A stakeholder who has dealt with the Rustomjee promoter says: “Boman is a compulsive charmer.”Through my limited interactions, it is hard to endorse that claim but I view him as a man who wants to succeed but not dominate the market. Hence it is unlikely Rustomjee will attain the massive scale of Lodha Group.Where Rustomjee and Lodha are similar is in their relative detachment to business and relative attachment to branding -- that makes them keep an eye on the bigger picture.Core market At the product level he displays a preference for township projects. And while his projects lack the beauty of Hiranandani Developers, they do have the ability to create well knit-communities.These attributes have helped in becoming a potent brand in the core market: Western suburbs. That’s the location where it has built prime projects of their location. In the two locations outside Mumbai, it has been challenged. Rustomjee Global City at Virar of 200 acres initially ran into a rough wall supposedly due to a clash with a local heavyweight.Similarly, there is the Rustomjee Urbania project in Thane of over 100 acres. There's no easy way to say this, in my view, it has to rank among the five most visually unappealing projects by any branded builder in the region. The optics could have been compensated by the product, but the overwhelming density makes it impossible to attract a pricing premium.Yet, despite these blips, there is no doubt in my mind that Rustomjee is the one player to watch out for in Mumbai real estate over the next five years.Super-prime sites Unlike most peers, there is no major track record of stalled projects that are likely to scare future customers. Its latest choice of locations for projects at super-prime places like Pali Hill, Bandstand mean that a landmark project is round the corner. It is trying for locations outside the Western suburbs as well. It will not be easy but the areas he is trying for are locations where the market lacks an established local heavyweight brand and land parcel sizes exist for community redevelopment projects.The biggest challenge, like with everything else in real estate, will be execution. This is a company that has grown rapidly in scale and mind-space in the last decade. Does it have the talent or management structure to manage that growth?Personally, I am glad to see the listing of the company. The listed space of the current real estate arena has been dominated by PR narrative-setters where every analyst is debating the extent to which management commentary has to be discounted.As an unlisted player Boman Irani has so far remained uncorrupted from that circus with an impulse to be candid on business. If he retains that impulse, then despite not being the biggest player, he may have the biggest voice.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/rustomjee-a-rising-mumbai-developer-hits-the-stock-market-9487311.html,IPO,"The builder, however, punched above its weight in the consumer mind-space because Boman (and especially his brother Percy) understood the value of branding ahead of their competitors.Thus, the elevated image of the company in public consciousness was inversely proportional to its negligible business size.The one man who would change the world for players like Rustomjee was former Municipal Commissioner Subodh Kumar.The optics could have been compensated by the product, but the overwhelming density makes it impossible to attract a pricing premium.Yet, despite these blips, there is no doubt in my mind that Rustomjee is the one player to watch out for in Mumbai real estate over the next five years.Super-prime sites Unlike most peers, there is no major track record of stalled projects that are likely to scare future customers.",[],[]

As of September 2022, the company had an active loan book of Rs 7,500 crore.We are planning a Rs 1,500-1,800-crore IPO by the fourth quarter of 2023 and expected to file the IPO papers with the Sebi by May 2023, Thomas Muthoot, managing director of Muthoot Microfin, told PTI on Wednesday from Kochi.At Rs 1,500-1,800 crore, our IPO will be the largest from the MFI segment, Muthoot said, adding that Muthoot Microfin will also be the first MFI to cross the Rs 10,000-crore AUM mark by the time of listing.Muthoot Fincorp and the Muthoot family own a 71 per cent stake in Muthoot Microfin. Besides, London-based private equity firm GPC holds 16.6 per cent and Chicago-based private equity fund Creation owns 9.3 per cent, he added.The company is planning to raise Rs 1,200 crore of primary capital, and there can be a small offer for sale by the external investors, but none of them has indicated that they want to exit the company, Sadaf Sayeed, the chief executive of Muthoot Microfin, told PTI from New Delhi.However, the final size of the OFS would be decided closer to the issue date and so is the valuation.

PB Fintech CEO Yashish Dahiya: Investors need to know we are a boring company that will keep growing; there will be no tamasha,09 November,"A year after listing on the stock exchanges amidst a bull market, PB Fintech co-founder and CEO Yashish Dahiya says he has finally made peace with the market, including investors and analysts not understanding the company’s stand on focusing on long-term growth over profitability.CFO and co-founder Alok Bansal’s advice to founders looking to list their tech startups is to understand that the life of a private and a public company are poles apart.Since listing, the stock of the Policybazaar and Paisabazaar parent has fallen by over 70 percent, a fall aided by market volatility and the global beating being taken by tech stocks. The lock-in period on 27.73 crore of PB Fintech’s shares ends on November 15, which could spark a further downside as investors may embark on a sell-off spree.In an interview with Moneycontrol, Dahiya and Bansal say that the company and founders are undeterred by the fall in the share price and will only focus on growth. The company has said that it aims to deliver Rs 1,000 crore in profits by FY27, and that it will be adjusted EBITDA-positive by the fourth quarter of FY23.Dahiya added that the company is looking to increase the annual run rate for insurance premiums from Rs 10,000 crore currently to Rs 35,000 crore by FY27.On November 8, PB Fintech reported a loss of Rs 187 crore for the quarter gone by. Losses narrowed from the Rs 204.44 crore loss in Q2 of FY22. Revenue from operations jumped 105.11 percent to Rs 573.47 crore in Q2 from Rs 279.58 crore last year.Excerpts from the interview.You have maintained that you will focus on growth more than profitability. This quarter your core business has seen good growth and losses have narrowed, too. Is profitability closer? What is the plan on that front?Yashish Dahiya: What is playing out is what I have always said —- that profitability is not a challenge; it is an automatic thing that will happen because our core business has gross margins now of 45 percent and it is growing at 55 percent.There has been some noise around new initiatives, while the core business has not yet come to scale. As it comes into scale, the new initiatives get dwarfed. Our target is to attain a profit of Rs 1,000 crore by financial year 2027. At that point the new initiatives will not matter.The two noises around our results are on ESOP charges as well as new initiatives. This year we faced Rs 700 crore in ESOP costs, but five years later it may be Rs 30 crore. The ESOPs we are giving are the same across all years. If you spread them out over the entire period, the cost is Rs 300 crore per year. Next year will be an average year where we may have Rs 320 crore of ESOP charges and we should have enough adjusted EBITDA and interest income to take care of it.So, there is no rocket science here. Our core business EBITDA has increased by Rs 60 crore YoY in the quarter. Our new initiatives have been declining by Rs 15 crore over the last two quarters. That will continue to happen for the next two quarters. Both put together it is obvious that we will be adjusted-EBITDA positive. Yes, we will still have the ESOP costs, which are high today because we are still in the first year after our IPO. As time goes, they will keep reducing.If you keep ESOP charges aside, we are already cashflow positive because we have interest income. We are earning Rs 60-70 crore every quarter in interest income. Next year, as we make Rs 200-300 crore in interest income, it should cover our ESOP charges. Also, next year, our positive adjusted EBITDA and Profit After Tax will not be very different, only Rs 50 crore apart.These are things that just have to fall into place. The market will start to give that credibility as things start falling into place. It takes them time.Alok Bansal: The first half of FY22 had very low ESOP costs as compared to the first half of FY23, so the losses going down looked good optics-wise. For the second half of both FY22 and FY23, there will be ESOP costs. But costs will come down this year. So, that, combined with the business doing better, it will look like a big difference in terms of the EBITDA loss number that will be reported. The company would not have done anything different, but it will just look optically very good.You had said earlier as well that the markets are not looking at the long term and focusing only on profitability. Do you think the perception will change as your numbers get better?Yashish Dahiya: In the first six months after listing, I used to get very frustrated that they were not getting it. Now, I don’t get frustrated. I say if they don’t get it, it is their problem. I don’t care. I can only explain. And I have also stopped trying to bother explaining too hard. In our analyst call, I was only focused on the target of delivering Rs 1,000 crore in profit by FY27. Eventually a business is a business. If it does not deliver profit, it doesn’t have value. We are very clear: let’s just deliver that number and not talk about the other pieces.Insurance premiums grew by 79 percent as compared to the same quarter in FY22. What kind of growth do you expect across verticals? Will this growth continue?Yashish Dahiya: There are of course wider reasons why the insurance space will grow. But looking at the controllables that we handled. In the first half of FY23, the retail protection industry saw negative growth, but we had growth. Even our enquiries have fallen, but our premiums per enquiry have gone up from Rs 1,100 to Rs 1,500.How much of sales is from physical touch points?Yashish Dahiya: Our meetings (with customers) are leading to 38 percent higher efficiency in conversion, i.e., premium divided by costs. About 14-15 percent of our indexed capacity is in the physical team. From a premium perspective, it is delivering upwards of 20 percent.Alok Bansal: This is different from the Point of Sale Person (PoSP). When we talk about offline, it is just an extension of the call centre sales and service channel we have in place already. It is not a different customer acquisition channel, but the same customer getting to meet an employee face to face.The company is at an annual run rate of Rs 10,000 crore for insurance premiums. What growth targets have you set for the coming years?Yashish Dahiya: We are looking to grow to an annual run rate of about Rs 35,000 crore for insurance premiums by FY27. Rs 10,000 crore of that should come from PoSP, which is currently at Rs 2,000 crore. The balance Rs 8,000 crore will grow to Rs 25,000 crore by FY27, so around three times higher. That is just about 22-23 percent growth rate, it is not a very extreme growth rate. If we grow like we grew in the last year, this will take us just two years to achieve. I am giving us four years.In this quarter, loans worth Rs 12,000 crore were disbursed through your platform. How much is that likely to grow?Yashish Dahiya: Credit disbursal in our country must be 10 times the insurance premium. My guess is it will grow much faster than the insurance premium.Alok Bansal: Credit goes through deep cycles, which insurance typically would not go through. Insurance is an all-season product. Both are very different.Did you have to make any changes in the flow of lending to adhere to the RBI’s digital lending norms?Yashish Dahiya: Paisabazaar does not touch money. The money goes from the lender to customers, and repayments go directly to lenders.What are the growth plans for the UAE business? Do you have any further geographical expansion plans for the near future?Yashish Dahiya: We are doing well. We are a long-term player, we are never in a hurry. There are no immediate expansion plans. See, we are very boring. I think that’s the thing that investors and analysts eventually need to take away — that this is a very boring company. They just keep growing. At some point they will keep putting in profit, that’s what they are.There will be no pivots and changes and any other kind of tamasha. Because we’ve got our core proposition right from the very beginning, which is to solve the health and life insurance problems of the middle class in the country. It will take us probably 20-30 years to solve that problem.Alok Bansal: You will not typically see any random stuff or any big bang acquisitions coming from this management team.On your analyst call you said your current valuation is the same as back in 2018-2019. Can you elaborate.Yashish Dahiya: Tencent invested in us at a pre-money valuation of $1.5 billion in 2019. Today we are at a pre-money valuation of $1.4 billion, after excluding cash. So, yes, we are valued less than we were in 2019. And it was an off-the-cuff remark. But from a revenue perspective, we are 5.3 times bigger.Alok Bansal: When you’re not in the market to raise money, all these things don’t matter to a company. Share prices can go up and down and it can impact the morale of employees to some extent. But from a company perspective, we are not in the market to raise more money. We just need to put our heads down and execute for the next few years.The lock-in period for PB Fintech ends on November 15. Are you worried about the stock falling further and that retail investors will take a hit? Have you had any discussions with your investors on their plans after the lock-in period?Yashish Dahiya: I spoke with all our pre-IPO investors on November 8. I said only one thing to them, that I am very grateful for their support in the company before we went public. I don’t hold them to anything anymore. They are of course free to do whatever they wish. I am not guiding them in any way or shape whatsoever. We are the drivers of the company, they were the passengers. They are free to get out whenever they feel is their priority.To be brutally honest, the share price per se is not controlled by the management. We control our deliverables, where we are ahead of all analyst expectations on both growth and profitability. The share price is actually the investors’ problem and my problem as an investor. The reason I care about the share price, quite honestly, is because I am the largest retail investor. I own 11 times the shares that all the retail investors put together hold. But it is not my job as founder and CEO to be worried. That is Yashish Dahiya as an investor’s problem, and that is the retail investors problem, whoever they are.We will deliver what we are talking about.What do you have to say to tech founders who are looking to list in the coming months? What is the learning from the past year?Alok Bansal: There has to be a reason for listing. If there is a need for capital, this is a very efficient way. You get a lot more freedom as a company but you also have a lot of restrictions as a company. The life of a private company and that of a public company are very different. My only hope is that any company or founder understands that before the listing.Private markets are more forgiving sometimes. They are also able to engage with you much more deeply. In public markets you don’t get that much of an opportunity to engage deeply with any particular investor. So, yes, the level of discussion becomes a little shallow. That’s where earnings calls become more important for how clearly you can establish your business model, your numbers. Don’t go to the markets before you have a certain stability in your business model.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/startup/pb-fintech-ceo-yashish-dahiya-investors-need-to-know-we-are-a-boring-company-that-will-keep-growing-there-will-be-no-tamasha-9474261.html,IPO,"A year after listing on the stock exchanges amidst a bull market, PB Fintech co-founder and CEO Yashish Dahiya says he has finally made peace with the market, including investors and analysts not understanding the company’s stand on focusing on long-term growth over profitability.CFO and co-founder Alok Bansal’s advice to founders looking to list their tech startups is to understand that the life of a private and a public company are poles apart.Since listing, the stock of the Policybazaar and Paisabazaar parent has fallen by over 70 percent, a fall aided by market volatility and the global beating being taken by tech stocks.The company has said that it aims to deliver Rs 1,000 crore in profits by FY27, and that it will be adjusted EBITDA-positive by the fourth quarter of FY23.Dahiya added that the company is looking to increase the annual run rate for insurance premiums from Rs 10,000 crore currently to Rs 35,000 crore by FY27.On November 8, PB Fintech reported a loss of Rs 187 crore for the quarter gone by.","['CFO', 'Paisabazaar', 'FY23.Dahiya', 'PB Fintech']","['$1.5 billion', '$1.4 billion']"

"SBI Mutual Fund's IPO plan shelved for now, says SBI chairman Dinesh Kumar Khara",03 November,"State Bank of India chairman Dinesh Kumar Khara said the planned share sale of the bank's mutual fund subsidiary has been shelved for the time being.SBI Mutual Fund, the country's largest asset manager with around Rs 6.5 lakh crore in asset under management, had in February selected seven merchant bankers for a USD 1-billion IPO. But soon the markets turned volatile with the Russian invasion of Ukraine later in that month.""There is no plan to list SBI Mutual Fund for now,"" Khara told reporters on the sidelines of the national banking summit here. Without citing any reason, he said the IPO plan stands shelved for now.On December 15, 2021, SBI had announced its plan to offload a 6 per cent stake in SBI MF through an IPO and was planning to raise around USD 1 billion.SBI holds a 62.6 per cent stake in SBI Mutual Fund, while the remaining 36.8 per cent is with the leading French insurer Amundi Asset Management which was planning to offload 4 per cent of its holding.Initially Amundi's holding was held by Societe Generale Asset Management, a subsidiary of Societe Generale of France which was transferred to Amundi in June 2011.SBI had reportedly selected seven i-bankers -- BofA Securities, Citi, HSBC Securities, Axis Capital, Kotak Capital, SBI Caps and BNP Paribas -- for the share sale.SBI has two other publicly traded subsidiaries -- SBI Life and SBI Card -- and has three more which can be monetised -- the mutual fund arm, general insurance vertical and the investment banking arm, SBI Caps.SBI Life was listed in 2017. In a Rs 8,400-crore share sale, the IPO was oversubscribed 3.58 times. SBI Card was listed in March 2020 just before the outbreak of the Covid pandemic in a Rs 10,354-crore public issue.If listed, SBI MF or SBI Funds Management, would have been the fifth listed fund manager after HDFC AMC, UTI Asset Management Company, Nippon Life India AMC and Aditya Birla Sun Life AMC.Meanwhile, the SBI chairman said credit demand, which has hit an eight-year high of 18 per cent last week, is coming in from across sectors, including SME corporates, retail and agriculture and that credit growth is a clear reflection that the economy is on a rebound.""There is a healthy demand in the housing sector despite rising rates. Higher rates have not deterred demand,"" Khare said, adding, he expects credit growth to be moderate going forward but will remain healthy overall to about 15-16 per cent after festive pickup normalises.On the digital rupee launch by the RBI on Tuesday, he said the CBDC pilot has gone well on the first day. He also said he doesn't think that bank deposits will be impacted with a full-scale launch of CBDC, which may happen over the next year.He further said there is no concern on the restructured book as it is behaving better than expected. The NARCL or the national bad bank, is now quite active. ""We will see good traction on that front going forward,"" he said, adding, banks are exploring all possible options for resolution of bad loans including the NARCL route.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/sbi-mutual-funds-ipo-plan-shelved-for-now-says-sbi-chairman-dinesh-kumar-khara-9440191.html,IPO,"Without citing any reason, he said the IPO plan stands shelved for now.On December 15, 2021, SBI had announced its plan to offload a 6 per cent stake in SBI MF through an IPO and was planning to raise around USD 1 billion.SBI holds a 62.6 per cent stake in SBI Mutual Fund, while the remaining 36.8 per cent is with the leading French insurer Amundi Asset Management which was planning to offload 4 per cent of its holding.Initially Amundi's holding was held by Societe Generale Asset Management, a subsidiary of Societe Generale of France which was transferred to Amundi in June 2011.SBI had reportedly selected seven i-bankers -- BofA Securities, Citi, HSBC Securities, Axis Capital, Kotak Capital, SBI Caps and BNP Paribas -- for the share sale.SBI has two other publicly traded subsidiaries -- SBI Life and SBI Card -- and has three more which can be monetised -- the mutual fund arm, general insurance vertical and the investment banking arm, SBI Caps.SBI Life was listed in 2017.SBI Card was listed in March 2020 just before the outbreak of the Covid pandemic in a Rs 10,354-crore public issue.If listed, SBI MF or SBI Funds Management, would have been the fifth listed fund manager after HDFC AMC, UTI Asset Management Company, Nippon Life India AMC and Aditya Birla Sun Life AMC.Meanwhile, the SBI chairman said credit demand, which has hit an eight-year high of 18 per cent last week, is coming in from across sectors, including SME corporates, retail and agriculture and that credit growth is a clear reflection that the economy is on a rebound.","['IPO', 'SBI MF', 'IPO', 'SBI Mutual Fund', 'Amundi Asset Management', 'Societe Generale Asset Management', 'Societe Generale', 'Axis Capital', 'Kotak Capital', 'SBI Caps', 'SBI Life and SBI Card', 'SBI Life', 'Card', 'SBI Funds Management', 'HDFC AMC', 'UTI Asset Management Company', 'Nippon Life India AMC', 'SBI', 'SME']","['6 per cent', 'around USD 1 billion', '62.6 per cent', '36.8 per cent', '4 per cent', '18 per cent']"
Byju’s gears up for $1-billion listing of subsidiary Aakash in India next fiscal,03 November,"Byju’s, India’s most-valued startup, is preparing to list its subsidiary Aakash, an offline coaching chain, in the first half of next year, sources familiar with the development told Moneycontrol.“Aakash is profitable and is a strong brand that is better understood in India. Investors were of the view that it should be listed here,” one of the sources cited above said, adding that while Byju’s still has ambitions of a US listing, it might happen well after Aakash’s listing.The size of the initial public offering (IPO)  could be in the range of a billion dollars, valuing Aakash at $3.5-$4 billion. While it expects to file papers with the market regulator in January next year, it plans to list by June 2024, or the first half of FY24.The move to sell a part in Aakash to the public comes at a time when Byju's has delayed its own IPO amid uncertain macroeconomic conditions that led to public shareholders dumping shares of loss-making companies.Shares of new-age loss-making tech companies like Zomato, Paytm, and PBFintech among others have been down 56 percent, 50 percent, and 59 percent respectively since the start of this year.Byju's had reported a 20x jump in its FY21 loss to Rs 4,589 crore on a revenue of Rs 2,428 crore.Techcrunch was the first to report on the development. While Byju's did not respond to queries from Moneycontrol at the time of writing this story, Aakash declined to comment.Byju’s acquired Aakash in April 2021 for a cash and stock deal of almost $950 million in what was one of the biggest acquisitions in the Indian education space. The company then deferred part of its payment for Aakash to September 23, 2022.Byju's eventually managed to pay 19 billion rupees ($234 million) to Blackstone Inc, settling its dues owed to the private-equity firm as part of the deal to buy Aakash Educational. While closing the deal, Byju's had paid all of Aakash's shareholders, except Blackstone as the PE firm had agreed on deferred payment.One of India’s leading coaching institutes, Aakash offers JEE and NEET preparation, among others, and has been active since 1988.It was in news earlier this week when it disclosed that Think & Learn Pvt, the company that operates Byju’s, will take an unsecured loan of Rs 300 crore ($36.45 million) from its wholly owned subsidiary Aakash Educational Services for its “principal business activities.”A Byju’s spokesperson has said then that the loan from Aakash Educational Services is in effect an advance against the marketing activities and campaigns that Byju’s has been running for Aakash.Byju’s Aakash has grown more than 100 percent since the acquisition, the spokesperson said, adding that it is only for principal business activities that a subsidiary and the parent company can give or receive loans.“In this case, the principal business activity is marketing for the core business of Byju’s Aakash on which the group has already spent and is now being reimbursed,” the spokesperson said.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/startup/byjus-preps-for-1-billion-ipo-of-subsidiary-aakash-in-india-next-fiscal-9438181.html,IPO,"While it expects to file papers with the market regulator in January next year, it plans to list by June 2024, or the first half of FY24.The move to sell a part in Aakash to the public comes at a time when Byju's has delayed its own IPO amid uncertain macroeconomic conditions that led to public shareholders dumping shares of loss-making companies.Shares of new-age loss-making tech companies like Zomato, Paytm, and PBFintech among others have been down 56 percent, 50 percent, and 59 percent respectively since the start of this year.Byju's had reported a 20x jump in its FY21 loss to Rs 4,589 crore on a revenue of Rs 2,428 crore.Techcrunch was the first to report on the development.While closing the deal, Byju's had paid all of Aakash's shareholders, except Blackstone as the PE firm had agreed on deferred payment.One of India’s leading coaching institutes, Aakash offers JEE and NEET preparation, among others, and has been active since 1988.It was in news earlier this week when it disclosed that Think & Learn Pvt, the company that operates Byju’s, will take an unsecured loan of Rs 300 crore ($36.45 million) from its wholly owned subsidiary Aakash Educational Services for its “principal business activities.”A Byju’s spokesperson has said then that the loan from Aakash Educational Services is in effect an advance against the marketing activities and campaigns that Byju’s has been running for Aakash.Byju’s Aakash has grown more than 100 percent since the acquisition, the spokesperson said, adding that it is only for principal business activities that a subsidiary and the parent company can give or receive loans.“In this case, the principal business activity is marketing for the core business of Byju’s Aakash on which the group has already spent and is now being reimbursed,” the spokesperson said.","['Aakash', 'IPO', 'PBFintech', 'Aakash', 'Blackstone', 'PE', 'Aakash', 'JEE', 'Think & Learn Pvt', 'Byju’s', 'Aakash Educational Services', 'Aakash Educational Services', 'Byju’s', 'Aakash', 'Aakash', 'Byju’s Aakash']","['a billion dollars', '$3.5-$4 billion', 'almost $950 million', '19 billion rupees', '$234 million', '$36.45 million']"

Then I will come back to you with the exact number and also the locations once it is approved by the board.”Currently, TMB has a pan-India presence with 509 branches and 12 regional offices across 16 states and four Union territories.The bank will expand branches “over a period of time” in such a way that there is a quick break-even and does not affect its bottom line, added Krishnan.On October 21, TMB announced that the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has lifted the restriction on opening new branches with immediate effect. The curbs were imposed for failing to raise subscribed capital to at least half of the authorised share capital line with requirements.In an interview with Moneycontrol in September this year, the bank's former MD and CEO K.V. Rama Moorthy had said that the RBI advised the bank to get listed and then approach it for opening new branches.The bank's shares got listed on the Indian stock exchanges on September 15, 2022.Also read: South Indian Bank aiming to lower gross NPA below 5% of advances by March, MD saysBusiness expansion plansTMB’s total business for the fiscal half year ended September stood at Rs 78,013 crore with a growth rate of 7.43 percent.

Now that the RBI has lifted restrictions on branch addition, the bank will be able to expand its footprint, which will also help in mobilising business further, Krishnan said, adding, TMB is also working on providing digital services to customers, which will, in turn, help in improving business.The total deposit base for this financial year is expected to be around Rs 48,500 crore while advances will be around Rs 34,500 crore, taking the total business to Rs 83,000 crore, he said.When asked about the bank’s credit growth trajectory, Krishnan said that 87 percent of the bank’s advances comprise loans to retail, agriculture and medium and small enterprises (RAM).Going forward, the bank will continue to focus on the RAM segment and also on corporate advances on a case-to-case basis, he added.TMB mobilised Rs 831.6 crore through its initial public offering, which will be utilised for augmenting tier-I capital to meet future requirements.TMB’s Capital to Risk (Weighted) Assets Ratio -- or the ratio of capital to its risk-weighted assets and current liabilities -- was at 24.58 percent for the fiscal half year ended September.Krishnan said the bank is very comfortable with its capital position post the IPO.

Instacart is said to pull plans to go public this year,21 October,"Instacart, a food-delivery company, is pulling its plans to go public this year, in the latest sign of turmoil in the public markets, three people with knowledge of the situation said.The company had been one of the few tech companies seeking to go public this year, as investors all but shut their doors to putting their cash in initial public offerings of unprofitable entities. Wall Street, spooked by rising inflation, the war in Ukraine and fears of a recession, has preferred putting its cash in safer bets.Instacart filed papers this year for a so-called confidential filing, which meant it did not yet have to disclose certain data about its business. The filing did not require Instacart to follow through with a public offering, but it was considered a big step toward one.But the window for going public this year is quickly shutting. Bankers prefer not to take companies public over the holidays, and the company was running out of time.The three people who spoke of Instacart’s pause on a public offering declined to be identified because they were not authorized to speak publicly.Instacart, founded in 2012, pairs people at home ordering groceries on its app with shoppers who work as independent contractors for the company. The contractors pick someone’s groceries and then deliver them.Instacart’s revenue surged as COVID-19 cases climbed at the beginning of the pandemic and people preferred to not go to stores for safety reasons. But that acceleration dropped off in the second quarter of 2021 as more people were vaccinated and returned to their regular shopping habits.In March, the company slashed its internal valuation to $24 billion from $40 billion. “We are confident in the strength of our business, but we are not immune to the market turbulence that has impacted leading technology companies both public and private,” Instacart said at the time.The year for public offerings got off to a paltry start. The pace of IPOs in the first half of this year was the slowest since 2009, according to data from Dealogic. The dearth in such offerings has also cut into the revenue of some of Wall Street’s biggest banks.This article originally appeared in The New York Times.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/instacart-is-said-to-pull-plans-to-go-public-this-year-9370381.html,IPO,"Instacart, a food-delivery company, is pulling its plans to go public this year, in the latest sign of turmoil in the public markets, three people with knowledge of the situation said.The company had been one of the few tech companies seeking to go public this year, as investors all but shut their doors to putting their cash in initial public offerings of unprofitable entities.Bankers prefer not to take companies public over the holidays, and the company was running out of time.The three people who spoke of Instacart’s pause on a public offering declined to be identified because they were not authorized to speak publicly.Instacart, founded in 2012, pairs people at home ordering groceries on its app with shoppers who work as independent contractors for the company.","['Instacart', 'Instacart', 'Instacart']","['$24 billion', '$40 billion']"
IPO window opens up if you build a robust business: Nikesh Arora of Palo Alto Networks,20 October,"IPO window always opens up if the entrepreneur walks down an articulate path to profit and the market believes in the business, Chairman and CEO of Palo Alto Networks said.“The difference between venture capitalists and entrepreneurs is that the former has a clear entry and exit into the business. Entrepreneurs are stuck with the business. They have to build a robust business to stand the test of time. In that perspective, the window is always open, the question is - is your business ready? If you file for IPO and say the business is not ready, then it’s not a market problem, it's an entrepreneurial problem,” Nikesh Arora said.Sharing his thoughts on the depth of entrepreneurship, Arora emphasised the ‘robustness’ of business models in the Indian startup ecosystem. He is hopeful that the unicorns have robust businesses and could survive the downturn. However, he did say that the businesses will have to raise money at lower valuation than before as the bumps in the road for unicorns have been re-ratings.“I believe our regulations are not designed perfectly to understand the downturns in the startup ecosystems. There will be a healthy requirement for people to focus on profits and cash flows. To a large extent, the credit goes to the Indian market as it didn’t fall for the lofty growth expectations. The Indian market always says, ‘Show me the money’,” he added.Speaking on the venture capitalists' aversion to risk in recent times, Arora stated that VCs are being cautious.Also Read | Digitisation to grow despite security risks, says Palo Alto Networks CEO Nikesh Arora“VCs have lived through many cycles. Asset prices were going up faster; quadrupling every six months. This led to the fear of missing out - everybody wanted to be in because they didn’t want to miss the upcycle. Thus, people were in there knowing the party was going to stop. However, they didn’t know when. The VCs have been around for a long time - they understand the markets and the cycle. They are more diligent and are spending more time on scrutiny. Most are glad that the party is over and they want to invest in real businesses for real terms. I don’t think they are in risk-off mode, they are in cautious mode. They will invest in good companies,” he said.Talking about easy money during the pandemic sparking huge valuations, Arora said: “The pandemic scenario forced all risks to be eliminated because the pandemic in itself was a big risk and we started going into a risk-con mentality.“We put a premium on growth and that resulted in valuations. People said money is free, you don't have to spend it, you don't have to pay any interest, you can load on debt, you can borrow money, you can create liquidity. So there's tons and tons of money in the economy that cause people to be a risk to the environment.”“Suddenly, people realise that money has a cost. Every time you add 100 basis points to the cost, you see a re-rating of valuations in the market across the board. This means you're back to a scenario where people have to manage risk and execution which sets valuations at a certain pace.”Earlier in September, Arora lauded India’s stability, resources and capability: “We have a demographic opportunity, also young people right population dynamics, and the GDP growth is phenomenal. And if we look at the global landscape, India offers a haven of stability and resource and capability, which I think will allow a lot of companies to succeed in the country.”",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/ipo-window-opens-up-if-you-build-a-robust-business-nikesh-arora-of-palo-alto-networks-9362121.html,IPO,"IPO window always opens up if the entrepreneur walks down an articulate path to profit and the market believes in the business, Chairman and CEO of Palo Alto Networks said.“The difference between venture capitalists and entrepreneurs is that the former has a clear entry and exit into the business.However, he did say that the businesses will have to raise money at lower valuation than before as the bumps in the road for unicorns have been re-ratings.“I believe our regulations are not designed perfectly to understand the downturns in the startup ecosystems.","['IPO', 'Palo Alto Networks']",[]

The private equity firm had picked up a significant minority stake in Global Health back in December 2013.As per the draft papers, the offer for sale component was up to 4.84 crore equity shares, as a part of which, an affiliate of Carlyle Group would sell up to 4.33 crore equity shares and Sunil Sachdeva (jointly with Suman Sachdeva) would offload up to 51 lakh equity shares.According to a fifth person familiar with the deal, the OFS component was likely to change now with Carlyle looking to sell more shares than originally planned. He indicated that valuation multiples have expanded in the listed healthcare/hospital segment which made private investors more comfortable and told Moneycontrol that the launch of the Medanta IPO was likely in early November.Major hospital stocks have perked up in the last three months with the likes of Max Healthcare, Apollo Hospitals, Aster DM Healthcare, Narayana Hrudayalaya, Krishna Institute of Medical Sciences and Dr Lal Pathlab rising between 10.89 percent and 22.37 percent.

31 of 44 shares listed since last Diwali trade above their issue price,27 October,"Shares of companies that came out with initial public offerings after Diwali last year have delivered strong returns to investors even though the Indian stock markets lost their shine amid worries of interest rate hikes by central banks and geopolitical tensions.These volatile markets almost halved IPO activity compared to the preceding period and are still struggling to get back on track.A total of 44 companies came out with initial share sales totalling Rs 95,000 crore since last Diwali, of which the shares of 31 companies are trading above their issue price, according to Prime Database.Adani Wilmar, which sold shares for the first time in February 2022, was the best-performing stock, followed by Veranda Learning Solutions, Data Patterns India, and Venus Pipes & Tubes. Campus Activewear, Go Fashions India, Metro Brands and Latent View Analytics also outperformed.“The IPO performance from last Diwali to this speaks volumes about the sectoral preference,” said Sonam Srivastava, smallcase Manager & Founder, Wright Research. “Consumption-led stocks have turned winners while highly valued tech IPOs, especially in the fintech sector, have struggled. The standouts in the tech segment are Data Patterns and Latent View, which are niche tech stocks that are also profitable.”Best performersAdani Wilmar shares logged 15 percent gains on the opening day and are currently up over 187 percent from the issue price. Veranda Learnings listed with 18 percent gains and has since advanced 137 percent. Data Patterns listed at a 29 percent premium and has gained 120 percent from its issue price, while Venus Pipes & Tubes, which was up 8 percent on listing, is now up 104 percent.FSN E-Commerce Ventures, the owner of Nykaa, was the best-performing share on listing day but soon lost its rally. The stock now trades at close to its issue price. Latent View, Go Fashion and Sigachi Industries, on the other hand, kept the listing day momentum going.Paytm owner One97 Communications, which had the second-largest IPO, remains the worst-performing on listing day and has still not been able to attract investor attention.Life Insurance Corporation of India has also struggled. Paytm is down over 68 percent while LIC has lost 36 percent from its issue price.“Among the IPOs that hit the street during this sluggish period, almost 25 percent are trading below their issue price,” said Manan Doshi, co-founder of unlistedarena.com. “The underperformers were mainly new-age companies that had weak cash flows or those that were priced aggressively. This was a result of the global correction, especially in new-age companies, and edgy sentiments due to the Russia-Ukraine war.”He said the majority of IPO shares sold during this period are trading comfortably above their issue price and many have yielded excellent returns.“As the euphoria faded during the year, investors are now more cautious on the front of profitability and valuations. IPOs that are priced reasonably are getting an overwhelming response from investors across the board,” Doshi added.Gaining momentumAnalysts expect the primary market will gain momentum soon and companies will go ahead with their IPO plans. About 71 IPOs were in the pipeline as of September.The Securities and Exchange Board of India has already approved IPOs from these companies, which plan to sell Rs 1.05 lakh crore of shares.Additionally, 43 companies seeking to offer Rs 70,000 crore worth of shares are awaiting SEBI’s approval.“IPOs will keep hitting the markets as a lot of investors want an exit and some companies want growth capital. The timing of these will depend on the recent performance of the secondary markets,” said Deepak Jasani, head of retail research at HDFC Securities. “Investors will have to evaluate them well and not just get carried away by the grey market premium or the listing gains of recent IPOs.

Online classes contribute to 10 percent of the overall business.CultFit had acquired Fitso from Zomato last year and also Gold’s Gym franchise rights in India.The company has also expanded its direct-to-consumer (D2C) selling business. It only sold apparels in the fitness category before Covid and now it includes products like treadmills, spin bikes, cycles and sportswear. This business now contributes one-third of the total revenue, said Krishnaswamy.“The fundamentals of any IPO is about the product, whether it be generating profit, cash flow, positive business proceeds. So if that is done, the valuation is not an issue,"" Bishnu Hazari, head of finance at CultFit, said about the IPO.Krishnaswamy said that they are now focused to have a robust stock after listing as many have failed to retain their stock prices even after blockbuster openings. “We really want to focus on the process, regardless of whether markets go down or not, we will take a 5-10 year timeframe,” he said.Founded in 2016 by Mukesh Bansal and Ankit Nagori, CureFit which rebranded to Cult.fit provides fitness-related services through both online and offline channels. These primarily include offline group workouts at Cult.fit centres and other gym or equipment-based workouts at partner gyms and fitness centres apart from online classes.During the pandemic, CultFit was majorly hit as many centres closed and they immediately shifted to online virtual classes. The startup even laid off employees but then got backed by Tata Digital and Bansal joined Tata in an executive role. Nagori, on the other hand, now runs a separate cloud-kitchen platform Curefoods.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/tata-backed-fitness-chain-cult-fit-gears-up-to-float-ipo-in-12-18-months-9351901.html,IPO,"Tata-backed fitness chain Cult.fit plans to go public in the next 12-18 months, senior executives of the company told Moneycontrol, though they could not disclose the size of the issue.The Mukesh-Bansal led chain now essentially runs two businesses– fitness and e-commerce.Earlier, all the centres were owned 100 percent by us, which means everybody from the trainers to the centre managers to the housekeeping staff were on our payroll.","['Tata', 'Moneycontrol', 'The Mukesh-Bansal']",[]

"Interview | Hero Future Energies will expand offerings, geographies after KKR funding: CEO ",12 October,"Hero Future Energies (HFE), the Hero Group’s green energy arm, aims to diversify its offerings portfolio and geographical presence supported by the recent $450 million investment by global private equity major KKR, Srivatsan Iyer, global Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of HFE said. In an exclusive interview with Moneycontrol’s Rachita Prasad and Sweta Goswami, Iyer talks about supply chain issues faced by the industry and the opportunities in the new energy space. While he held his cards close to his chest on a possible initial public offering of the company, Iyer said that as the business demands they will continue to raise equity funding.Edited excerpts:Now that KKR and Hero group have committed $450 million to HFE, what is the big picture here and why now? India is on the cusp of a massive aspiration in renewable energy going forward. India’s 2030 target is to have half of its electricity generation come from renewables, as well as reduce its carbon intensity by at least 45 percent. To achieve both of these, renewable energy has to play a huge role. We (HFE) are going to be 10 years old later this month; we've been committed to growing renewable energy and providing clean energy solutions. With the increasing uncertainty in the energy markets globally, several countries are looking at renewable energy not just to address sustainability and climate change but also for energy independence. This is the right time for this investment for us to not just grow in India but also in other targeted geographies. We have a presence in Asia as well as in the UK. It’s a good time for us to grow in renewable energy and also test some of the newer solutions that will help decarbonisation.What is HFE’s growth strategy now after the latest round of investments?We're going to participate in renewable energy – solar and wind power – and also grow in emerging technologies like battery storage, round-the-clock RE and green hydrogen. We have had discussions with our shareholders that we want to grow in conventional as well as in new technologies.Can you cite some more tangible targets in terms of what kind of capacity you would be looking at in wind and solar? And when you're saying other forms, what kind of plans do you have there?We've not set explicit capacity targets for ourselves because generally capacity is associated with just solar and wind. If you were to invest in battery storage, for example, you can't necessarily add that capacity only to solar and wind. We have bagged our first battery storage bid from Kerala and in that sense, we are leading the pack. There are going to be several other battery storage bids over the next six months as states look to use it to balance the grid or to maintain grid stability. We are certainly looking at upcoming round-the-clock bids.We're waiting for the unveiling of the green hydrogen policy, which we expect sometime this month. But in the meantime, we are in active discussions with many customers in India and some in the UK for pilot projects in green hydrogen so that we know what are the levers to reduce costs going forward that would make green hydrogen economically viable versus conventional sources of energy. For us, the quickest win is to try to convert grey hydrogen projects into green hydrogen. Parallelly, we're looking at how to use green hydrogen to do things where hydrogen is not being used today. We will be a producer of green hydrogen. Our role will be to supply green hydrogen to various end users.You don’t want to specify targets, but with the KKR investment, are you fully funded for your expansion plans? Is there an appetite to get more investors? We're funded for now. The good problem to have is, ""Can I finish using all those monies in the next two to three years?"" And if we find the right mix of projects and the right growth, we hope to use it up in the next two to three years. And then at that point, we will decide the next course of action.The next big step for you would be going to the market at some stage. Do you have in place a plan for an initial public offer (IPO)?No, we don't have a timeline or a deadline. At some point, we'll have to go back and raise more equity as we grow and as this market grows. Now, whether that will take the form of a market listing or whether additional equity from the same or new shareholders is yet unknown. We'll keep raising new equity every so often.Do you have any other plans of monetization of assets?Everything is on the table at this point. The shareholders obviously have to consider what's the best way for them to monetize their investment in the company. It can take multiple routes.What are your expectations from the Indian government with regard to its upcoming phase II of the green hydrogen policy? If you rewind 10 years, the solar and wind energy tariff was as high as Rs 10-15 a unit. The government stepped in because they were keen to grow this space and they wanted to ensure the sector learns, grows and reduces cost. Today you can get solar power for as low as Rs 2.5 per unit. We're looking for something similar from the government in terms of green hydrogen as well. Whether it be demand mandates, viability gap funding or something completely revolutionary, like dollar-link contracts rather than rupee-link contracts – there’s a lot that can happen.Indian renewable energy companies are now seeing an opportunity in the commercial and industrial (C&I) space. What is the mix of government and C&I in HFE’s portfolio? And is that a space you would be looking at increasingly? The corporate sector accounts for roughly half the energy consumption in India. So for us to get to the targets we have set ourselves as a country, the corporate sector has to be an important participant. Hence, C&I is going to be important for multiple reasons. One is they are looking at sustainability because they made commitments to their shareholders and the markets in terms of the overall sustainability targets or carbon footprints. Secondly, they are looking at this for the lowest cost of energy supply. Today, C&I is roughly 10 percent to 15 percent of our portfolio.How is the supply chain looking like right now, whether it's wind or solar, in terms of equipment? The supply chain is still tight globally. The only thing that has improved over the last 12 months is freight rates; container costs have come down and that part of the supply chain has stabilised globally. In non-solar space, there is still a shortage of semiconductors. This impacts RE in a fairly significant way. On the solar side, there is a global shortage all the way from polysilicon to modules. The good news is a lot of capacity is being added globally.How effective have the production-linked incentive (PLI) schemes been overall?The PLI scheme is certainly a step in the right direction and it has been focusing on backward integration all the way to polysilicon which is the last bit of a solar PV (photovoltaic) system. Otherwise, we are still supply-chain dependent on China. In the short term, we don't see PLI making a huge impact in the Indian market context because it would take two to three years to build capacity. But in terms of energy self-sufficiency and in terms of meeting our 10-year goal I think the PLI should help set up enough capacity in India to at least meet domestic growth. It should also allow some of the big players to export. The US is starting to put restrictions on imports from China and so I'm sure the Indian module manufacturers will look at that as an export market that's valuable for them. We really hope module prices come down. Many in the C&I sector are looking at the module prices today and say, ""Look, we will just wait."" It will take a little bit of time, globally, for the new capacity to come online. In the meantime, we are really looking at some kind of ALMM (approved list of module manufacturers) scheme to broaden the list of suppliers that allows the independent power producers (IPPs) to have a slightly larger range of suppliers.Are you witnessing any kind of slowing in existing jobs?It's very hard even for IPPs to compete with each other because we all buy modules more or less at the same price; it's not like one can outbid the other by 30 percent. We saw a lot of activity on hybrid bids and on the solar park bids but IPPs are still bidding based on the expectation of future module pricing because the tariffs that we are bidding at don't reflect today's module pricing at all. They do have a view of the future and they are bidding based on that. I expect softening of prices to happen in the 12- to 18-month range, certainly not in the coming 6 to 9 months.The 2022 United Nations Climate Change Conference, or COP27, is happening in November. How different would the conversations be from earlier, given the changes in the energy market in the last one year?The current volatility in the energy markets is going to be the focus of all discussions. Countries would have to defend ramping up their conventional or thermal energy generation. At the same time, I believe that the countries are going to make a deeper commitment to speed up renewables growth for precisely these reasons.There was a lot of talk in COP26 about supporting investment for adaptation for global regions that are going to be impacted. Because of what's happening in the world around us today, I suspect that conversation may be a little more muted. I suspect it's going to be more about let's not think more about investments in adaptation, let's focus all our investments in building out renewable energy.With the fresh funding, what is the biggest challenge you foresee for your company right now?The biggest challenge for us as a company and also for the sector is the uncertainty in the supply chain and the price volatility. No matter what we bid for, whether it's the C&I space or a utility space, we all bid based on a 12-18-month forward outlook on module pricing. The same goes for WTGs (wind turbine generators) because steel prices have become quite volatile again over the last 24 months, and WTG is tied to steel for the most part. That is the biggest worry.Wind energy in India has seen a decline in capacity addition growth since 2018, except for 2020. Despite having about seven windy states, projects are concentrated only in about two states. Why is that so? What is HFE’s specific plan for wind energy?There are several factors to that. The first thing is the variability of wind speeds in India. The last three years have been about the slowest in history. If you go back four to five years back, the wind speeds were at P50, what you'd expect from a 30-year average. Now, whether the last three years' low wind speed is driven by climate change or it's just a temporary anomaly is yet to be seen. As an industry, we tend to be a little more conservative about wind generation because of what has been happening in the last three years in India. Clearly, everybody wants to run to the states that have the most wind resources and run there first. Now, Rajasthan has been very attractive for that. And so everybody has gone there. Gujarat has its own set of challenges for wind. Karnataka and Andhra had been quite popular. If you ever want to look for RTC (round-the-clock) or peak power-type projects going forward, wind is going to be a critical contributor there. The biggest challenge for wind has always been to find high wind resource sources, and in India those are limited.

Sebi's top measures and their impact on the markets,03 October,"On Friday, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) unveiled a series of measures after a scheduled meeting of its board. In her first press conference, Sebi’s new chief Madhabi Puri Buch said liberalising rules and keeping the market accountable through disclosures and transparency would be the key objectives of the regulator. Here is a ready reckoner of the key measures the regulator announced and their implications for the markets.Want money? Make disclosuresMeasure: Sebi proposed that companies seeking to raise money through an Initial Public Offering (IPO) of shares disclose key performance indicators that are not included in their financial statements. More importantly, the issuing company must disclose its price per share in past fund-raising rounds, giving potential investors a clear picture of their valuations. Funds raised going back three years need to be disclosed. This is significant after the losses investors made on recent IPOs by start-ups that raised questions about their valuations.Impact: The additional disclosures will enable investors to make an informed decision on whether to participate in an IPO or not. This also makes IPO managers accountable in explaining on how valuations are arrived at by giving a historic comparison of valuations. Start-ups will find it easier to convince investors of their potential because they would be able to put forth the unique parameters that are more representative of their business beyond traditional metrics.Fund manager under the radarMeasure: Sebi included mutual fund units under its prohibition of insider trading rules and said it would prescribe a separate chapter laying down the guidelines for the industry. A separate code of conduct would be released for designated executives in respect of fund houses. Sebi would get to monitor the transactions of fund managers closely under this rule. The measure comes after some fund managers were found to have transacted in the equity market through mutual fund units based on privileged information, sparking worries that such a practice may be rampant at other fund house. Buch said the regulator will ensure adequate surveillance and punitive actions.Impact: The move would result in changes in the investment mandate of MF schemes or the conversion of an open-ended scheme to a close-ended one. This is also likely to reduce churn in schemes with the flipside that fund managers may lose some of their discretion in managing the schemes. Sebi will, however, have to assess whether privileged information has an impact on the net asset value of the fund even though it may move share prices in the market.Bonding with SebiMeasure: The regulator has proposed that online bond platforms be registered with it as brokers under the debt segment. Sebi said it would issue a procedural circular soon, dealing with specifics and the mechanics of online bond platform providers. For the retail investor, the platform interface would be the touchpoint but the backend of transactions, including settlement, would be through exchanges. Sebi has also proposed reducing the face value of listed debt securities to enhance retail participation.Impact: Independent online bond platforms that mushroomed during the pandemic have so far been in a regulatory vacuum. By coming under Sebi’s ambit, bond platforms would gain more credibility. Instances of mis-selling have also worried market participants, with some online platforms offering structured deals to retail participants unaware of the underlying risks.Speeding up payment, settlementMeasure: The capital markets regulator announced a set of measures to expedite processing of payments and the settlement of instruments. Fund houses would be required to process redemption in three working days instead of the current 10, and dividend payouts in seven working days instead of the current 15. In derivatives, Sebi will allow netting of cash segment settlement and physical settlement of the Futures and Options segment upon expiry.Impact: The derivatives measure will reduce margin requirement for brokers after expiry, giving them some relief. It aligns the cash and derivatives markets, which will result in reduction of price risk.Pre-filing of offer documentsMeasure: Sebi has allowed an optional pre-filing of offer documents on stock exchanges for IPOs. This pre-filed document would be confidential between the issuer, exchanges and the Sebi. The document available to the public would have Sebi’s observations in it, giving potential investors an early peek into the regulator’s reservations, if any, on the IPO.Impact: Potential investors in IPOs may get the regulator’s observations earlier as these would be incorporated in the offer document. This reduces the overall lead time for IPOs.More the merrier in offer for saleMeasure: Sebi has allowed non-promoter shareholders with less than a 10 percent stake to participate in an Offer For Sale (OFS) by a company provided they have a minimum Rs 25 crore worth of shares to sell. This mechanism will be available to real estate investment trusts (REITs) and infrastructure investment trusts (InvITs). The cooling period has been reduced to two weeks from the current 12 weeks.Impact: The move allows all non-promoters to participate in an OFS, subject to conditions. This would encourage greater participation in an OFS by companies. It also provides large institutional funds another route to trim their holdings in companies after repeated complaints over ‘leakage’ when such investors sought to sell a part of their stakes through the bulk and block deal windows.Divestment boostsMeasure: Sebi has removed the requirement of a 60-day volume weighted average market price for open offer price calculations in the case of listed public sector entities. The move comes as the government pushes for divestment in the companies it owns. Sebi explained that strategic divestment requires several price-sensitive details to be made public at various stages. This makes shares of PSUs susceptible to volatility.Impact: The move could help enhance the value the government can derive for its stake in listed PSUs. Excessive volatility in stock performance at times could be detrimental to the valuation of a company, especially PSU stocks that tend to have a higher level of volatility.Easy induction of directorsMeasure: Companies can now appoint independent directors through an ordinary resolution if they meet the threshold for the such a move as well as the threshold for a majority of minority shareholders. Currently, appointments, reappointments and removal of such directors requires a special resolution.Impact: This makes the process of appointment and removal of independent directors easier for companies.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/mutual-funds/sebis-top-measures-and-their-impact-on-the-markets-9269301.html,IPO,"The document available to the public would have Sebi’s observations in it, giving potential investors an early peek into the regulator’s reservations, if any, on the IPO.Impact: Potential investors in IPOs may get the regulator’s observations earlier as these would be incorporated in the offer document.Excessive volatility in stock performance at times could be detrimental to the valuation of a company, especially PSU stocks that tend to have a higher level of volatility.Easy induction of directorsMeasure: Companies can now appoint independent directors through an ordinary resolution if they meet the threshold for the such a move as well as the threshold for a majority of minority shareholders.",[],[]
"SME listings catch investor fancy: 87 IPOs filed in January-September to raise Rs 1,460 crore",02 October,"Strong performance of past IPOs spurred investors' interest, with 87 small and medium enterprises (SMEs) garnering Rs 1,460 crore through initial share-sales in the first nine months of the year. This was way higher than 56 companies that had raised Rs 783 crore through initial public offering (IPO) in the entire 2021, the industry data showed.Further, the remaining part of the year 2022 can see more mature companies accessing the platform. Moreover, tech-based and larger broking players can play a major role in developing the SME platform, Uday Nair, Director at Fedex Securities, said, adding, ""overall the year is good for SME companies looking to raise capital from the exchange"". ""SME segment is not impacted by the bearishness in the market and investors are looking forward to the healthy pipeline of IPOs going forward, many companies have filed or planning to file their documents for listing on the BSE SME and NSE Emerge platforms,"" Prateek Jain, Director at Hem Securities, said.Going by the industry data, a total of 87 IPOs have debuted on the SME platforms and raised Rs 1,460 crore during January to September. These companies belong to a wide range of sectors like IT, automotive components, pharma, infrastructure and hospitality, and jewellery.The month of September saw 29 SMEs hitting the primary market despite volatility in the secondary market compared to nine in the preceding month. Of the 29 issues, 25 have already concluded and the remaining four are ongoing. Many IPOs have seen robust participation from qualified institutional investors as well as retail investors and one such public issue was that of Insolation Energy.The IPO of Insolation Energy, which successfully concluded last week, was subscribed by 183 times. This was the highest subscription in any BSE SME IPO. Gaurav Jain, Director at Hem Securities, attributed the robust fund raising in this year to strong performance of many IPOs in the segment that attracted more investors.""Though small in size, these IPOs are getting a good response. The segment has performed at a time when the benchmark indices have taken a beating and IPOs on the main boards have seen fewer public issues, compared to last year,"" he added. Fedex Securities' Nair said that SME platform is a sector agnostic platform for raising growth capital. With more and more companies accessing the market, a natural filter gets created adding to that is good financial performance by some of these companies, which have helped in building investor confidence.The company raised the funds through IPOs for business expansion plans, working capital requirements, debt payment and other general corporate purposes.

For instance new age companies and start-ups focus on growth and revenue metrics that may differ from the regular ones.""The thinking behind this is to give investors a better basis to make their decisions whether the price is appropriate or not.

Tech IPO market faces worst year since global financial crisis,29 September,"Initial public offerings by U.S. tech companies have sunk to their lowest levels since the global financial crisis of 2008, as stock market volatility, soaring inflation, and interest rate hikes have soured investor sentiment towards new listings.According to Refinitiv data, only 14 tech companies have floated their shares on stock exchanges so far this year, compared with 12 in 2009. The IPOs this year have raised $507 million, the lowest amount that has been raised through flotations since 2000.Total IPO volumes fell 90.4% in the first nine months of this year, compared with last year.Analysts interviewed by Reuters said a steep drop in stock market valuations has deterred tech firms from pursuing stock market launches.The forward P/E (price-to-earnings) ratio of the S&P Information Technology index was trading at 20.18 — the lowest level since April 2020.”Institutional investors have been shifting capital allocations while retail investors have been licking their wounds,” said James Gellert, chief executive officer at Rapid Ratings.”This is a terrible backdrop for IPOs, in particular tech IPOs, which rely on bull markets and momentum investors to bolster their market entries.”The Renaissance IPO index, which captures the largest and most liquid U.S IPOs, has slumped 50.4% this year, compared with the S&P 500 index’s drop of 23%.Shares of Corebridge Financial Inc, which launched the largest IPO in the U.S. this year, were trading about 4% below its offer price of $21 on Wednesday.Rachel Gerring, Americas IPO leader at Ernst & Young, said the poor after-market performance of 2021 IPOs has dampened investor appetite for new stocks.”Tech has been impacted in an outsized way by the market-wide drop in valuations.

"Gold Plus Glass Industry, Uniparts India get Sebi's nod to float IPOs",26 September,"Float glassmaker Gold Plus Glass Industry and engineering solutions provider Uniparts India have received capital markets regulator Sebi's approval to raise funds through initial public offerings (IPOs).The two companies, which had filed preliminary IPO papers with the Securities Exchange Board of India (Sebi) in April, obtained observation letters from the regulator during September 22-23, an update with the markets watchdog showed on Monday.In Sebi's parlance, the regulator's observation implies its go-ahead to launch an initial share-sale. Going by the draft papers, Gold Plus Glass Industry's IPO comprises a fresh issue of equity shares aggregating up to Rs 300 crore and an offer for sale (OFS) up to 1,28,26,224 equity shares by promoters and existing shareholders.As a part of the OFS, promoters -- Suresh Tyagi and Jimmy Tyagi -- will offer up to 10,19,995 equity shares each and investor PI Opportunities Fund-I will sell up to 1,07,86,234 equity shares. The company proposes to utilise net proceeds from the fresh issuance of equity shares towards funding debt, working incremental requirements and general corporate purposes.Gold Plus Glass Industry is one of the leading float glass makers in India with a 16 per cent share of manufacturing capacity in fiscal 2021. The company's products cater to a range of end-use industries, including automotive, construction and industrial sectors, with a variety of applications. The initial share-sale of Uniparts India is entirely an OFS of 1,57,31,942 equity shares by promoter group entities and existing investors, according to the draft papers.Those offering shares in the OFS are promoter group entities -- The Karan Soni 2018 CG-NG Nevada Trust, The Meher Soni 2018 CG-NG Nevada Trust, Pamela Soni -- and investors Ashoka Investment Holdings Ltd and Ambadevi Mauritius Holding Ltd. Since the IPO would be entirely an OFS, the company will not receive any proceeds from the public issue.This would be the company's third attempt to go public.

China Vanke unit Onewo to raise $783 million in Hong Kong's largest IPO of 2022,19 September,"Developer China Vanke Co Ltd's property services arm has launched Hong Kong's largest initial public offering (IPO) of 2022, aiming to raise up to $783.5 million in a deal that will be a key test for investor appetite.The subsidiary, Onewo Space-Tech Service, has set a price range of HK$47.1 to HK$52.7 a piece in the public offering of 116.74 million of its shares, which represent 10% of the company's share capital, according to a deal term sheet.The price range values Onewo at $7 billion to $7.8 billion.Vanke, which is China's second-largest property developer by sales and is listed both in Shenzhen and Hong Kong, owns 62.9% of Onewo and is its biggest customer, regulatory filings showed.The deal is likely to reveal how much appetite investors have for buying into the services and management sub-sector associated with China's cash-squeezed real estate market, which has lurched from one crisis to another over the past year.While a string of Chinese developers have defaulted on offshore debt in that time, Vanke has weathered the crisis better than its rivals, thanks in part to carrying less debt relative to its equity and having partial state ownership.Once Onewo's shares debut on the Hong Kong stock exchange, their performance is also likely to influence the prospects of other property services companies looking to raise capital through public offerings.The Hang Seng property services and management index is down 44.3% so far this year, reflecting ongoing weakness in the real estate sector.Some services companies have scrambled to lend money to their parent companies or raise funds for them. Investors have viewed such moves dimly.In August, shares in property manager Jinke Smart Services Group (9666.HK) dropped 37% in one day after it said it would lend up to $222.3 million to parent Jinke Property.The Onewo IPO would not be directed at raising liquidity for Vanke, Yu Liang, chairman of the parent company, said on Aug. 31. The subsidiary accounted for only 1% to 2% of Vanke's assets and profits, Yu added.SCALED BACKGlobal financial market volatility led to Onewo's IPO being scaled back from an initial ambition to raise up to $2 billion, people with knowledge of the matter previously told Reuters.Onewo said it planned to use funds from the IPO to expand its existing businesses, upgrade its software and take majority stakes in three to five ""value added"" service providers in its sector.The IPO deal has participation from six cornerstone investors that have together subscribed for up to $280 million worth of the shares, the filings showed. Among those investors are China's Mixed Ownership Reform Fund, China Chengtong Investment and UBS Asset Management.The IPO final price will be set on Sept. 22; public trading of the shares is due to begin on Sept. 29.The deal also comes as a boost for the Hong Kong bourse.Amid Sino-U.S. tension and a tightening regulatory environment in China, companies have raised just $2.42 billion in IPOs in Hong Kong so far in 2022, versus $23.76 billion in the same period of 2021, Refinitiv data showed.Onewo's transaction will become Hong Kong's largest IPO of 2022, eclipsing that of Huitongda Network Co Ltd (9878.HK), which raised $297 million in February.The two largest equity deals in Hong Kong this year - China Tourism Duty Free Corp's $2.1 billion share sale and one by Tianqi Lithium's worth $1.7 billion - were secondary listings.

SoftBank-backed Oyo seeks to resurrect IPO after growth resumes,19 September,"Oyo Hotels, the once high-flying Indian startup, is reviving plans for a stock-market debut after cost cuts and a recovery in travel helped it reduce losses.The hotel-booking company filed fresh financial documents on Monday and is now targeting an initial public offering in early 2023 provided that India’s stock market continues to hold up and economic conditions improve, according to people familiar with the matter. Oyo, formally known as Oravel Stays Ltd., is internally working toward a January IPO as executives are encouraged by a pick-up in demand, they said, asking not to be named discussing confidential plans.Oyo had filed preliminary IPO documents in 2021, only to shelve the listing plan earlier this year after the prolonged pandemic hurt its growth and forced the company to cut thousands of jobs. It disclosed its latest financials in an IPO filing addendum on Monday, with the numbers showing narrower losses and a rebound in sales for the year through March 2022 and the following three months.The startup is now focusing on four main regions: India, Malaysia, Indonesia and Europe, where it manages vacation homes. It has cut down operations in markets it previously considered crucial, such as the US and China, where its employees now measure in the single digits, one of the people said.Oyo and founder Ritesh Agarwal are trying to pull off a successful IPO after a series of setbacks in their efforts to change the hotel and lodging industry. SoftBank Group Corp. founder Masayoshi Son was an early and enthusiastic backer, and the Japanese conglomerate holds about 47% in the Gurgaon-based startup. The 28-year-old Agarwal owns about one third.The revived listing plan also underscores how India’s stock market is bucking the trend of globally declining tech stocks. Accelerating inflation, lingering Covid-19 infections and the war in Ukraine have sent the tech-heavy Nasdaq index down 27% this year. Meanwhile India’s benchmark NSE Nifty 50 index is up 1%.Oyo reported a loss of 18.9 billion rupees ($237 million) for the year through March 2022, nearly halving from the previous 12 months. The numbers were restated from previously undisclosed figures and included in the IPO document addendum made available by its bankers.The annual loss before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization shrank to 4.8 billion rupees from 18.7 billion rupees. For the three months through June 2022, earnings on that basis were 105.75 million rupees, while the net loss was 3.5 billion rupees.Revenue from contracts with customers for the fiscal year through March 2022 increased 21% to 47.8 billion rupees, with travel picking up as the pandemic eased. Revenue is still far below the 131.7 billion rupees booked for fiscal 2020, before the full effect of the coronavirus kicked in.Oyo filed its preliminary document, the so-called Draft Red Herring Prospectus or DRHP, for a $1.1 billion IPO in September last year, and 12 months have since lapsed without the listing being cleared. Earlier this year, it sought to file additional documents and got regulatory approval for the move. The startup was most recently valued at $9 billion, according to researcher CB Insights.Oyo was started in 2013 by Agarwal, then 19, who dropped out of college to travel around the country. The startup began to work with small hotels to standardize everything from bed linen to bathroom shower fittings that it then branded with its bright red & white Oyo logo.With backing from high-profile investors such as SoftBank and Lightspeed Venture Partners, it expanded furiously into Southeast Asia, China, Europe and the US as it signed on hotel partners with agreements of guaranteed returns. At one point, founder Agarwal ambitiously targeted the title of the world’s No.1 branded stay operator.During the pandemic, Agarwal was forced to overhaul the startup’s business model. Oyo fired thousands of employees and stopped providing hotel vendors any guaranteed returns or capital to refurbish their properties. He described the shift as a transition to an “asset light” model. Instead of offering minimum guarantees, Oyo now supports hotel and vacation home partners with technology and product services, as well as customer support. Hotel owners can self-enroll, and manage bookings and services on its app.The new strategy helped the company become cash-flow positive in the quarter through June, and a similar positive trend has continued in the current quarter, according to one of the people.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/softbank-backed-oyo-seeks-to-resurrect-ipo-after-growth-resumes-9197821.html,IPO,"It has cut down operations in markets it previously considered crucial, such as the US and China, where its employees now measure in the single digits, one of the people said.Oyo and founder Ritesh Agarwal are trying to pull off a successful IPO after a series of setbacks in their efforts to change the hotel and lodging industry.Hotel owners can self-enroll, and manage bookings and services on its app.The new strategy helped the company become cash-flow positive in the quarter through June, and a similar positive trend has continued in the current quarter, according to one of the people.",['IPO'],"['18.9 billion rupees', '$237 million', '4.8 billion', '18.7 billion', '47.8 billion', '$1.1 billion', '$9 billion']"

""Patanjali Ayurved is an established company and is ideal from the point of view of IPO... the product line, reach, customer base and profitability and future projection, make it most favourable,"" he added.The second would be Patanjali Medicine, which owns Divya Pharmacy, and then Patanjali Wellness which runs chains of OPD and hospitals in India.

Exclusive | SBI’s largest BC partner SAVE Solutions eyes IPO in FY25,16 September,"SAVE Solutions, the largest business correspondent (BC) partner of State Bank of India (SBI), plans to go public in fiscal 2025, its top official said.“We are planning to launch an IPO (initial public offering) in the 2024-25 financial year which will totally depend on the situation of the market sentiments,” the company’s managing director and chief executive officer (MD & CEO) Ajeet Kumar Singh told Moneycontrol on Friday, September 16.Business correspondents act as a last-mile touchpoint for banks that are unable to set up branches in remote areas. These touchpoints allow bank customers to undertake various banking transactions including withdrawal of cash and money transfer.In exchange for providing banks’ services to its customers, BCs charge a predetermined minimum fee per transaction to the respective lender.SAVE solutions, based out of Gaya, Bihar, started operations in 2009. In FY21, SAVE Solutions’ BC business clocked in a total transaction value of Rs 41,000 crore, Singh said. According to him, for SBI, SAVE Solutions undertakes about 500,000-600,000 transactions per day amounting to nearly Rs 200 crore.Per the Indian Banks’ Association (IBA) website, there are a total of 285 registered corporate BCs in India.Further, the firm also plans to go for another round of equity capital raising from institutional investors, Singh said.“We are also planning to raise the third round of equity and we have already started the process. Microfinance portfolios will definitely grow very fast… Other portfolios will also grow as per the business plans. So this is a good trend,” Singh added.As per Singh, SAVE Solutions works with banks including SBI, Bank of India (BOI), Bank of Baroda (BoB) and Punjab National Bank (PNB) as their BC partner, and serves about 4 lakh customers on a daily basis.“We are the largest business correspondent of the State Bank of India having 9,000 CSPs (customer service points), and are present pan-India. We have a presence of like 1,200 CSPs for BOI. We have 500 CSPs for BoB. We have just started with PNB six months back, so have 300 CSPs for them and are also working with the two RRBs (regional rural banks),” Singh said.According to Singh, state-run banks now want to use the BC network in not just banking transactions but also to source loans.“BCs have a wide scope because banks nowadays are looking at BCs in a different way. Banks like SBI have tied up with us for loan sourcing, loan collections, from agriculture to sales and agriproducts and loan products through our CSP network,” Singh said.When asked whether digitisation of banking services poses a threat to the BC model, Singh said that even though online transactions are increasing, digital platforms have a higher presence and are more widely used in urban areas but 95 percent CSPs are in rural areas.“The rural area users are not very friendly with digital payment methods.

MC Exclusive | Mankind Pharma files papers for $700 million plus IPO,16 September,"Private equity firm ChrysCapital-backed Mankind Pharma, the maker of top selling condom brand Manforce Condoms, has filed its DRHP ( draft red herring prospectus ) with market regulator Sebi with plans to raise upwards of $700 mn via an IPO , one of the biggest ever attempted by a player in the segment, multiple industry sources with knowledge of the matter told Moneycontrol.The current record in the sector is held by Gland Pharma which launched an $869 million IPO in November 2020. Mankind Pharma is India’s fourth largest pharmaceutical company in terms of domestic sales and second largest in terms of sales volume for FY22.Moneycontrol was the first to report the listing plans of the company on 28th April, 2022.“ Mankind Pharma has done the e-filing of its draft papers. It is cash rich and has been trying to expand its OTC products vertical for better margins, so there is a strong consumer angle. The IPO will consist of solely an OFS or offer for sale component of 10 per cent ,” said one of the persons above.Two other persons confirmed the filing of papers with the market regulator with one of them adding that since Mankind Pharma largely has a domestic business, it would resonate far more with investors than those pharma firms which have more overseas exposure.A fourth person said that Mankind Pharma was targeting a valuation between $7bn and $8bn which could be revised upwards later depending on market conditions and that the selling shareholders eyeing a partial exit would include the likes of key investors like ChrysCapital and Capital International. The promoter family was also likely to dilute some stake, this person added.JP Morgan, Jefferies, IIFL Capital,  Axis Capital and Kotak Mahindra Capital are the investment banks working on the IPO, sources added. Shardul Amarchand Mangaldas, Cyril Amarchand Mangaldas and Sidley are the law firms on the dealAll the four persons above spoke to Moneycontrol on the condition of anonymity.Moneycontrol has sent email queries to Mankind Pharma, ChrysCapital and Capital International but could not elicit an immediate comment from them. The IPO advisors couldn’t be reached immediately at the time of going to presss.In 2015, Capital International had purchased a 11 percent stake in Mankind Pharma from ChrysCapital for $200 million. In April 2018, a ChrysCapital-led consortium, which included GIC and CPPPIB, made a stunning comeback and bought a 10 percent stake again for around $350 million.Earlier in the year, Mankind Pharma had acquired the formulations brands of listed player Panacea Biotec in India and Nepal for  Rs 1,872 crore to explore new therapeutic areas.The DRHP filing by Mankind Pharma comes at a time when there is uncertainty about the roadmap of two other large sized IPOs by pharma peers. Macleods Pharma has deferred its listing plans following a valuation mismatch with investors.In August 2021, Bain Capital-backed Emcure Pharma had also filed papers with the regulator for a proposed Rs 4,500–Rs 5,000-crore IPO and got the go ahead from Sebi, but the issue hasn’t been launched yet.MANKIND PHARMA: THE FOOTPRINT AND STATSThe Delhi-based Mankind Pharma was founded by Ramesh Juneja and the firm became a fully integrated pharmaceutical company in 1995. The firm is engaged in developing, manufacturing and marketing a diverse range of pharmaceutical formulations across various acute and chronic therapeutic areas, as well as several consumer healthcare products.The company is focused on the domestic market, as a result of which its revenue from operations in India contributed to 97.60% of its total revenue from operations for the Financial Year 2022, which was one of the highest among peers identified by IQVIA.Kaloree 1, Prega News Unwanted-21 (oral contraceptive), AcneStar, Gas-O-Fast and KabzEnd (Ayurvedic product which treats constipation) are some of the other brands in the Mankind Pharma portfolio.According to its website, it has an employee base of 14,000 and is present in 34 overseas destinations including the US, Sri Lanka, Cambodia, Kenya, Cameroon, Myanmar, and the Philippines.Mankind Pharma had earlier joined hands with BDR Pharma to launch the anti-COVID-19 pill Molulife in India. For FY21, the firm clocked revenues of around Rs 6,385 crore, EBITDA of Rs 1,657 crore and PAT of Rs 1,293 crore.  The firm has 21 manufacturing units in various locations such as Paonta Sahib, Himachal Pradesh, Sikkim, Vizag and Rajasthan, its website says.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/ipo/manforce-condoms-maker-mankind-pharma-files-papers-for-700-mn-plus-ipo-one-of-the-biggest-ever-in-sector-9187321.html,IPO,"The IPO will consist of solely an OFS or offer for sale component of 10 per cent ,” said one of the persons above.Two other persons confirmed the filing of papers with the market regulator with one of them adding that since Mankind Pharma largely has a domestic business, it would resonate far more with investors than those pharma firms which have more overseas exposure.A fourth person said that Mankind Pharma was targeting a valuation between $7bn and $8bn which could be revised upwards later depending on market conditions and that the selling shareholders eyeing a partial exit would include the likes of key investors like ChrysCapital and Capital International.The firm is engaged in developing, manufacturing and marketing a diverse range of pharmaceutical formulations across various acute and chronic therapeutic areas, as well as several consumer healthcare products.The company is focused on the domestic market, as a result of which its revenue from operations in India contributed to 97.60% of its total revenue from operations for the Financial Year 2022, which was one of the highest among peers identified by IQVIA.Kaloree 1, Prega News Unwanted-21 (oral contraceptive), AcneStar, Gas-O-Fast and KabzEnd (Ayurvedic product which treats constipation) are some of the other brands in the Mankind Pharma portfolio.According to its website, it has an employee base of 14,000 and is present in 34 overseas destinations including the US, Sri Lanka, Cambodia, Kenya, Cameroon, Myanmar, and the Philippines.Mankind Pharma had earlier joined hands with BDR Pharma to launch the anti-COVID-19 pill Molulife in India.","['IPO', 'OFS', 'ChrysCapital', 'Capital International']","['700', '$869\xa0million', '10 per cent', 'between $7bn', '8bn', '$200 million', 'around $350 million']"
What should you do with Tamilnad Mercantile Bank shares after lacklustre listing?,15 September,"Tamilnad Mercantile Bank (TMB), a private sector lender focussed on South India, made a lacklustre debut on September 15 amid concerns over legal challenges and a lack of sufficient clarity on management’s long-term performance.The bank listed at a minor discount of 2.94 percent to issue price. The stock listed at Rs 510 on the BSE, and the opening tick on the NSE was Rs 495 against its issue price of Rs 510 per share.Most analysts tracking the issue say that if you had been looking for listing gains, you should exit the stock if it falls a bit more. Long-term investors can wait and watch.“Those who applied for listing gains can maintain a stop-loss of Rs. 470,” said Santosh Meena, Head of Research, Swastika Investmart. “Long-term investors should wait for some quarters to let the dust settle, and in the meanwhile, we suggest investors go for the existing listed banks where the management’s track record and performance during multiple credit cycles are visible.”Manoj Dalmia, founder and director, Proficient Equities, said long-term investors can wait for the stock to gain because the Nifty Bank index looks bullish.Even those looking for listing gains can hold on for a few weeks, but with a stop-loss in place based on their risk appetite, he added.The initial public offering (IPO) received a ‘subscribe’ rating from analysts at securities firm, given its strong financials, improving asset quality with declining non-performing assets and growing deposits.The IPO was subscribed 2.86 times, with qualified institutional investors buying 1.62 times the allotted quota, non-institutional investors 2.94 times and retail investors 6.48 times. The response was much lower than had been expected.Given the muted overall response of investors, a flat to moderate listing gain had been in store for TMB, said Prashanth Tapse, Research Analyst and Senior Vice President (Research), Mehta Equities.“We advise allotted investors to think of booking whatever marginal profits are generated,” he added.Tamilnad Mercantile Bank's 37.73 percent paid-up equity share capital or 53.76 million equity shares is subject to outstanding legal proceedings at various forums, in connection with which proceedings against the bank have been initiated by various regulatory authorities.They include the Reserve Bank of India and the Directorate of Enforcement; some of the regulators have imposed or sought to impose penalties on the bank in the past.The bank cannot assure investors that these matters will be resolved in a timely manner or at all. Any adverse developments in such proceedings may result in the imposition of injunctions or penalties and require it to incur significant costs to contest them, which could have a material impact on its reputation, business, finances and operations, Arihant Capital Markets said recentlt.To be sure, TMB is one of India’s oldest banks with a legacy of about 100 years. It is focussed on diversifying its product portfolio to access more clients and continues to expand relationship banking facilities to increase its network.The lender intends to focus more on fee-based products such as debit cards, credit cards, insurance and online bill payment.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

AIG unit Corebridge raises $1.68 bln in year's largest IPO,15 September,"AIG Inc's life insurance and retirement division Corebridge Financial Inc raised $1.68 billion on Wednesday in the biggest initial public offering (IPO) so far this year, braving market volatility and ending a seven-month lull in major listings.AIG said it sold 80 million Corebridge shares at $21 per share, which was at the lower end of their indicated target range of $21 to $24 per share.The IPO values Corebridge at $13.6 billion.All proceeds of the IPO will go to AIG and the new company is not raising new capital, according to an earlier filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.Corebridge's share sale could help shake the IPO market out of its hibernation. Russia's invasion of Ukraine and rampant inflation triggering rises in interest rates have been driving stock market volatility since February, making it hard for companies to press ahead with listings.IPOs in the United States are on track for their worst year in over two decades, according to Dealogic, which tracks listing data going back to 1995. So far, companies have raised about $18 billion this year, compared to over $231 billion during the same period last year, according to the data provider.Other companies, including social media platform Reddit and software firm ServiceTitan, have been forced to delay their IPO plans this year in light of the volatility.With a raise of $1.7 billion, the Corebridge offering also marks the biggest U.S. IPO this year, topping private equity firm TPG Inc.'s $1.1 billion listing in January.BIGGEST IPO OF 2022AIG first announced it would separate its life and retirement unit and list it as a new public company in 2020, thereby allowing the insurance giant to focus on its property and casualty business.Such a move reflects a wider trend among insurers to focus on a single product offering, given their different return profiles to shareholders; a trend which AIG had successfully fought off for years, including a campaign by activist investors in the mid-2010s advocating such a separation.After divesting a 10% stake to private equity firm Blackstone Inc (BX.N) for $2.2 billion last year, AIG filed for the Corebridge offering in March. It had initially planned to complete the listing by the end of June, before postponing it due to market turbulence. read moreThe Houston-based AIG subsidiary provides retirement solutions and insurance products in the U.S.AIG will control almost 78% of the company's shares after the listing, with Corebridge trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “CRBG”.JPMorgan Chase & Co., Morgan Stanley and Piper Sandler Co. are the lead underwriters for the IPO.

BharatPe appoints former RBI Deputy Guv BP Kanungo and Zomato Chairman Kaushik Dutta to board,13 September,"Merchant payments and financial services player BharatPe has made two new board appointments in an attempt to grow the number of independent directors to prepare for its plans to go public.The startup has appointed former Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Deputy Governor BP Kanungo and Zomato Chairman Kaushik Dutta as independent directors, the company said on September 13.The company added that former Union Bank of India Chairman Kewal Handa stepped down from the board to align with the startup's plans to ensure that the board comprises one-third of Independent Directors. However, he will continue to support the board and the management in an advisory capacity, the company said.Speaking on the appointments, BharatPe's Chairman Rajnish Kumar said, ""Earlier this year, we had put in place a robust governance framework and were in the process of identifying the right leaders who could join the Board in building BharatPe 2.0. The recent important appointments are driven by this very thought and we hope that the composition of Board, processes and compliances in place will lead to best governance practices in the industry.""Kanungo served as RBI Deputy Governor from 2017-2021, while Dutta has experience in corporate governance, including in his leadership roles at PwC. BharatPe said that Dutta's guidance will be key for the company as it prepares to go public in the next two to three years.Suhail Sameer, CEO of BharatPe, said, ""It is my honor to welcome seasoned industry leaders - Shri Kanungo and Shri Dutta to the BharatPe Board. With them joining, BharatPe has one of the most admired Boards in the country, comprising highly respectable names from the banking and financial services industry.

The tussle became public with Grover questioning Chairman Kumar as well as Sameer. The incident ignited a debate about standards of corporate governance in startups and the role of investors in ensuring that proper standards are followed.Following Grover's exit, BharatPe said that the company was looking at an overhaul of its corporate governance framework and also sacked employees who were responsible for the misappropriation of funds after a corporate governance review was conducted.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/bharatpe-appoints-former-rbi-deputy-guv-bp-kanungo-and-zomato-chairman-kaushik-dutta-to-board-9172251.html,IPO,"Merchant payments and financial services player BharatPe has made two new board appointments in an attempt to grow the number of independent directors to prepare for its plans to go public.The startup has appointed former Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Deputy Governor BP Kanungo and Zomato Chairman Kaushik Dutta as independent directors, the company said on September 13.The company added that former Union Bank of India Chairman Kewal Handa stepped down from the board to align with the startup's plans to ensure that the board comprises one-third of Independent Directors.However, he will continue to support the board and the management in an advisory capacity, the company said.Speaking on the appointments, BharatPe's Chairman Rajnish Kumar said, ""Earlier this year, we had put in place a robust governance framework and were in the process of identifying the right leaders who could join the Board in building BharatPe 2.0.","['Reserve Bank of India', 'RBI', 'Union Bank of India', ""BharatPe's"", 'Board', 'BharatPe 2.0']",[]

IPOs give average 50% returns in 2022 despite fall in number,12 September,"Despite the fall in share sales through initial public offers so far this year, these issues have given a good 50 per cent average returns, while the Sensex gained only 1.6 per cent, shows an analysis. So far in 2022, 51 IPOs have raised Rs 38,155 crore, down from Rs 64,768 crore through 55 issues in the same period last year.There were only eight big-ticket issues -- with the over Rs 20,500-crore LIC being the biggest but one of the worst performers -- in 2022 compared to the last year, where 33 companies raised more than Rs 1,000 crore each, according to an analysis by Bank of Baroda house economist Dipanwita Mazumdar. Till September 2021, the IPOs gave a return of 74 per cent, whereas Sensex had risen by 20 per cent but 16 of those big-ticket IPOs with issue size of above Rs 1,000 crore are operating at a discount.In all of 2021, companies raised Rs 1,21,680 crore from the market and the boom can be attributed to the Sensex rally as the index jumped from 40,000 points to 60,000 points between April and October 2021. From the 2021 issues, 30 per cent listed at a premium of above 20 per cent, compared to 15 per cent in 2022, and 50 per cent of 2021 issues returned more than 20 per cent the same for 2022 is 43 per cent.As against this, Sensex saw considerable volatility in through 2022 trading in the range of 50,000-60,000. In 2022, the share of companies receiving negative return rose to 40 per cent, above 45 per cent companies gave over 20 per cent returns and only five issues returned more than 100 per cent from the issue price.The biggest losers are One97 Communications (Paytm) which is down 67 per cent from its issue price, LIC down 31.1 per cent, Zomato (down 20.7 per cent), PB Fintech (down 49.3 per cent) Star Health & Allied Insurance (down 18.2 per cent), CarTrade (60.1 per cent below issue price), Nuvoco Vistas Corporation (down 34.3 per cent), Indian Railway Finance (down 12.3 per cent) and Sanmar Chemicals is down 22.1 per cent from the issue price.

"Sachin Bansal-led Navi Technologies gets SEBI nod for Rs 3,350 crore IPO",12 September,"The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has approved Sachin Bansal's fintech startup Navi Technologies for an Initial Public Offering (IPO), providing the Flipkart co-founder a boost as he works to create a financial services conglomerate.In March of this year, Navi Technologies submitted draft papers to SEBI in order to raise up to Rs 3,350 crore through a fresh issue of shares. The IPO will not have an offer for sale (OFS) by shareholders, read Bansal who holds a 97.39 percent stake in the fintech.The fintech firm received an observation letter in response to its filings on September 5, according to the SEBI website.According to the DRHP, the fintech company plans to invest the proceeds of the IPO in Navi Finserv and Navi General Insurance companies in addition to general expansion goals.Bansal and Navi Technologies have been contacted by Moneycontrol regarding the approval; a comment is awaited.The approval is a relief for the fintech firm after the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) rejected its application for a banking licence through its wholly-owned subsidiary Chaitanya India Fin Credit as well as petitions from five other applicants.Navi Technologies is a tech-driven financial products and services company. Since the company's founding, it has increased its product offerings to include mutual funds, general insurance, house loans, and personal loans. Additionally, it provides microloans via Chaitanya India Fin Credit.While Navi registered a profit of Rs 71.1 crore in FY21, the company incurred losses to the tune of Rs 206.42 crore in the first nine months of FY22.Microfinance loans are Navi's largest market segment; in Q3 of FY22, the company had assets under management (AUM) worth Rs 1,808 crore. The vertical's gross non-performing assets (NPAs) were 3.83 percent in the same period. Gross NPAs for personal loans were 1.12 percent.Bansal stated in a September 2, 2021 interview with Moneycontrol that he likens Navi, which is short for ""navigator,"" to banks and NBFCs.“We are trying to work backwards and see what a bank for a billion people looks like. It has to be a lot more automated, things have to be a lot more simple, users should be able to help themselves. Banking should be as easy as going on Swiggy and ordering food,” he said.Bansal founded Navi Technologies in December 2018 just six months after quitting his first venture, Flipkart, which was snapped up by Walmart for $16 billion the same year.Incidentally, Bansal held only 5.5 percent stake in Flipkart before his exit. This stands in stark contrast to Navi, where Bansal holds a 97.39 percent stake, choosing to raise further funds through an IPO rather than through private investors.Go Digit General Insurance, led by veteran insurance executive Kamesh Goyal and backed by Prem Watsa's Fairfax Capital, is still awaiting approval. According to information on the market regulator's website, SEBI has not yet provided observations for the IPO of Go Digit.Go Digit General Insurance did not comment on the update.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/ipo/sachin-bansal-led-navi-technologies-gets-sebi-nod-for-3350-crore-ipo-9166441.html,IPO,"The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has approved Sachin Bansal's fintech startup Navi Technologies for an Initial Public Offering (IPO), providing the Flipkart co-founder a boost as he works to create a financial services conglomerate.In March of this year, Navi Technologies submitted draft papers to SEBI in order to raise up to Rs 3,350 crore through a fresh issue of shares.The IPO will not have an offer for sale (OFS) by shareholders, read Bansal who holds a 97.39 percent stake in the fintech.The fintech firm received an observation letter in response to its filings on September 5, according to the SEBI website.According to the DRHP, the fintech company plans to invest the proceeds of the IPO in Navi Finserv and Navi General Insurance companies in addition to general expansion goals.Bansal and Navi Technologies have been contacted by Moneycontrol regarding the approval; a comment is awaited.The approval is a relief for the fintech firm after the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) rejected its application for a banking licence through its wholly-owned subsidiary Chaitanya India Fin Credit as well as petitions from five other applicants.Navi Technologies is a tech-driven financial products and services company.","['The Securities and Exchange Board of India', 'Navi Technologies', 'Initial Public Offering', 'IPO', 'Flipkart', 'Navi Technologies', 'IPO', 'OFS', 'IPO', 'Navi Finserv', 'Navi General Insurance', 'Navi Technologies', 'Moneycontrol', 'the Reserve Bank of India', 'RBI', 'Chaitanya India Fin Credit', 'Navi Technologies']",['$16 billion']

The new ATF pricing mechanism is expected to boost sentiment in the aviation sector,"" a person aware of the airline’s plans said.ALSO READ: Price war in the sky: Airfares tumble after government lifts fare capsThe airline had planned to come out with its delayed IPO in the second quarter of this financial year, but will now wait for a couple of months before considering a launch.Another person said that while Go First was optimistic about its IPO on the back of a recovery in domestic and overseas air travel, a weak April-June quarter, accompanied by rising costs of aviation turbine fuel, have caused the airline to delay its IPO plans once again.COVID-19 VaccineFrequently Asked QuestionsA vaccine works by mimicking a natural infection. A vaccine not only induces immune response to protect people from any future COVID-19 infection, but also helps quickly build herd immunity to put an end to the pandemic. Herd immunity occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population becomes immune to a disease, making the spread of disease from person to person unlikely. The good news is that SARS-CoV-2 virus has been fairly stable, which increases the viability of a vaccine.There are broadly four types of vaccine — one, a vaccine based on the whole virus (this could be either inactivated, or an attenuated [weakened] virus vaccine); two, a non-replicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of SARS-CoV; three, nucleic-acid vaccines that have genetic material like DNA and RNA of antigens like spike protein given to a person, helping  human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine; and four, protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombinant proteins of SARS-COV-2 along with an adjuvant (booster) is given as a vaccine.Vaccine development is a long, complex process. Unlike drugs that are given to people with a diseased, vaccines are given to healthy people and also vulnerable sections such as children, pregnant women and the elderly. So rigorous tests are compulsory. History says that the fastest time it took to develop a vaccine is five years, but it usually takes double or sometimes triple that time.Go First's Draft Red Herring Prospectus has expired on August 26 and the airline will need to refile its IPO papers with the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI).A public issue or rights issue needs to be opened within 12 months of the date of issuance of observations, according to SEBI regulations. This period was extended by six months during the pandemic, but no longer.This is the third time Go First has delayed its IPO plans since last year. The airline had received approval from the market regulator for its IPO last year but had held back the share sale plan first in August 2021 after SEBI called the promoters, the Wadias, for a pending inquiry, and then in December 2021, Go First further delayed the offering due to the outbreak of the Omicron wave.The Russia-Ukraine war, which started in February, and the mega IPO of Life Insurance Corporation (LIC) also delayed the airline's IPO plans.Go First has been planning a listing since at least 2015 when it was known as GoAir.The IPO market has slowed this year after record funds were raised in FY22. Indian companies sold shares worth $995 million in the January-March quarter of 2022, compared to $2.57 billion during Q1 of 2021, according to EY Global IPO Trends. That was a decline of 60 percent in proceeds raised.The mega Rs 21,000-crore IPO of LIC made a tepid debut on the stock exchanges, listing at a discount to the issue price.Jet fuelAviation turbine fuel (ATF) prices have shot up almost 120 percent since May 2021, peaking at Rs 141,232.87 per kl in June.In order to reduce ATF prices in India, the government had asked oil marketing companies (OMCs) to switch to the MOPAG (Mean of Platts Arab Gulf)-based pricing system instead of the prevailing dual pricing mechanism to determine ATF prices.The new mechanism is expected to help airlines predict ATF price movements based on international prices and help them be better prepared in case global crude prices rise.Fuel costs now account for 50 percent of overall airline expenses for domestic airlines in India. Airlines in India had to find a way around rising ATF prices even as the industry was stepping up operations to cater to rising demand after two years of the COVID-19 pandemic and fare caps imposed by the government still in place.Go First plans to use Rs 2,200 crore to be raised from the IPO to reduce debt and repay lessors. The remaining Rs 1,600 crore will be deployed to expand the airline’s operations in India and internationally, including adding flights to Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Sri Lanka, and Nepal.The airline expects domestic passenger traffic to surpass pre-COVID-19 levels by 5-10 percent by the second quarter of 2022-23 in the absence of a new wave of COVID-19.The airline plans to convert its entire fleet of Airbus A320 Neos and Airbus A320 Ceos to Airbus A321 Neos. The airline currently has 52 A320 Neos and 6 A320 Ceos in its fleet.

"As Tamilnad Mercantile Bank IPO opens today, should you subscribe?",05 September,"The initial public offering (IPO) of Tamilnad Mercantile Bank (TMB), one of the oldest private sector banks in India, is set to open on September 5. The issue is generating positive responses from analysts and investors.Most analysts said retail investors should apply for the IPO citing consistent financial performance and healthy asset quality. At the same time, a few are cautious in the short term as they see a couple of risks.“At the upper end of the price band, the bank is valued at 1.35 times price to book value (after issue) as on 31 March 2022 which looks reasonable. However, a change in management and pending legal proceedings in relation to shareholding remain risks,” said Kajal Gandhi at ICICIdirect.The broker said investors can apply for the IPO with a long term view. As much as 37.7 percent of equity share capital is subject to legal proceedings, which ICICI Securities said is a key risk. Besides, significant regional concentration in southern India also poses a risk.The company has set a price band for the IPO at Rs 500-525 a share. The offering is a fresh issue of shares worth Rs 832 crore. An investor can apply for a minimum 28 shares and in multiples thereof.Meanwhile, the firm issued 71,28,000 shares at Rs 510 apiece to raise Rs 363.53 crore from 10 anchor investors ahead of its IPO. Anchors are Nomura, Societe Generale, Max Life Insurance, Kotak Mahindra Life Insurance, Bajaj Allianz Life Insurance, Cholamandalam General Insurance, Authum Investment, Alchemie Ventures, Moneywise Financial Services, and Blend Fund.YES Securities rated the issue ‘subscribe’ as it sees stable and benign asset quality, reasonable loan growth and operating expense control, and healthy net interest margin.“At the upper end of the price band, TMB would trade at an FY22 P/B of 1.4 times. For FY22, it has delivered a return on assets of 1.7 percent and a return on equity of 16.6 percent. Importantly, given the business model of TMB, we do not see these return ratios as volatile going forward. Consequently, we find the IPO valuation for the bank as eminently attractive,” said Shivaji Thapliyal of YES Securities.The lender offers a wide range of banking and financial services primarily to micro, small and medium enterprises, agricultural and retail customers. It has 509 branches, of which 106 are in rural, 247 in semi-urban, 80 in urban and 76 in metropolitan centres. Its overall customer base was 50.8 lakh as of FY22-end and 80 percent of its customers have been associated with the bank for more than five years.Religare Broking also has a favourable view on the stock. It said the bank is well placed to capitalise on growing industry trends given the strong growth potential in geographies where the company is present.“Moreover, the firm would focus on improving technology which would help them achieve higher operational efficiency and improved drive customer experience,” it said.Others that advise subscribing to the issue include Ventura Securities and Nirmal Bang.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

MC Exclusive | PE Fund True North launches sale process to exit Kerala’s KIMSHEALTH; IPO plans on hold,03 September,"More than five years after investing in Kerala’s largest corporate hospital chain KIMSHEALTH, home grown private equity investor True North is now in exit mode and has launched a process to sell its stake in the firm which has put its IPO plans on the backburner, multiple industry sources with knowledge of the matter told Moneycontrol.“The original plan was to go down the listing route but the firm has shelved the IPO plans for the time being due to unfavourable market conditions and macro-economic factors. Teasers have been sent out and True North is keen to unlock value and monetize its investment,” said one of the persons above.In March 2017, True North invested $200 mn in the erstwhile KIMS ( Kerala Institute of Medical Sciences) Group as part of an exit to Ascent Capital Advisors India Pvt Ltd and OrbiMed Advisors Llc along with primary capital infusion to fund the growth plans of the hospital chain across India and the Middle East. The private equity firm had picked up around a 40 per cent stake as part of the deal.A second person told Moneycontrol that investment bank ICICI Securities (which had been roped in earlier for the IPO , fund raising and capital structuring process) was handling the sale process for the proposed transaction.A majority stake in KIMSHEALTH may also be up for grabs if the founder group led by Founder Chairman and Managing Director Dr MI Sahadulla opts to dilute stake.“ Depending on the valuations , the founders may also explore a small secondary stake sake,” the second person added.To be sure, KIMSHEALTH has a holding company and an operating company and an internal restructuring exercise was conducted in preparation for a potential listing. True North holds around 70 per cent in the holding company and the holding company owns around 60 per cent of the operating company.A third person told Moneycontrol that both strategic and private equity players would be tapped for the proposed transaction and that if the process did not yield the desired results, then the hospital chain would revert to the original listing plansA fourth person also confirmed the exit plans of True North from the KIMSHEALTH  and said players like Max Healthcare and Manipal Hospitals were likely to express preliminary interest in the sale process if a controlling stake was in play.“ The asset has scale and a good brand and would be attractive for a player who wants to enter the Kerala market,” he elaborated , adding that since the KIMSHEALTH had an India business as well as a Middle East business, a key factor would be if suitors would opt to invest in both verticals or pick one.All the four persons above spoke to Moneycontrol on the condition of anonymity.In response to a detailed email query from Moneycontrol, True North and ICICI Securities declined to comment.Responding to his firm’s likely interest in the proposed deal, Abhay Soi , Chairman and MD , Max Healthcare said,” This is market speculation. There has been no engagement on our part with ICICI Securities.”Email queries sent to KIMSHEALTH , the Founder Chairman and Managing Director Dr MI Sahadulla , Manipal Group and Dr Ranjan Pai ( Chairman of Manipal Group) were left unanswered at the time of going to press.True North, which also invests in segments like consumer, financial services and technology products and services, has been an early and active investor in healthcare and life sciences companies in India, including branded and generic pharmaceuticals, biotech, CDMO, API.

"RBI prodded bank for IPO, will apply for new branches post- share sale: Tamilnad Mercantile Bank MD says",01 September,"Prodding by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and stakeholders prompted the  101-year-old Tamilnad Mercantile Bank (TMB) to opt for an initial public offering (IPO) this year, Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer K.V. Rama Moorthy said.TMB’s IPO, aimed at raising in excess of Rs. 830 crore, will open on September 5 and close on September 7.“On one side, the prodding by the regulator has been happening. On the other side, in 2016 there was an effort in AGM (Annual General Meeting) to go for IPO, it was not passed with required majority at that point of time,” Moorthy said in an interview on September 1.“In 2020 when the AGM was held, it was taken up. Resolutions (for IPO) were voted in favour of. RBI was also asking to get ourselves listed. For opening a few branches, I think they advised us to get ourselves listed and then approach them for opening new branches,” he added.TMB faces restrictions on opening new branches for failing to raise its subscribed capital to at least half of its authorised share capital line with requirements.When asked whether the bank will approach the RBI after the share sale for expansion of its network, Moorthy said the bank will approach the regulator, but did not share details on the expansion plan.“We will be able to give a guidance (on expansion) post-IPO once we finalise our strategy with board-approved policies in place,” Moorthy said.TMB has a branch network of over 500 branches in both rural and urban areas, with a majority located in southern states.Experts said the regulator does not issue instructions pertaining to IPOs to lenders until it finds material concerns at a bank.“This is a bank-specific restriction. This bank was under some cloud for different reasons, it was having issues and it was not a general instruction that the RBI gave, it is very bank- specific. We don’t know under what circumstances they were imposed,” a senior banker said requesting anonymity.The Thoothukudi-based bank has set a price band of Rs 500-525 a share for the IPO, which consists of a fresh issue of 15.8 million shares.At the upper end of the price band, TMB will raise around Rs 831.60 crore from the share sale. Axis Capital, Motilal Oswal and SBI Capital Markets are the lead managers to the IPO.TMB is  “confident” that the public issue will be well received by investors, the MD said.“We are confident about the public issue and the performance of the bank. Hundred years of a live organisation with good distinction of continuous profits, and decent dividends, including during the toughest periods of time. At this point of time, I think we are one of the better players in the market as compared to our peers as of now,” Moorthy said.According to the bank’s FY22 annual report, as of March-end, TMB’s total advances stood at Rs 33,491.54 crore, up 8% Year-on-Year (Y-o-Y).Some 87% of the lender’s total advances were in the retail, agriculture and micro, small and medium enterprises segments (RAM), the MD said without giving any guidance on credit growth.“Post-Covid-19, everyone is euphoric about the GDP of the country. Naturally, when the GDP of the country is going to be a little euphoric, I think there will be several factors which will be working in favour of bank loans and GDP growth rate,” Moorthy said.Total deposits of TMB Bank, as of March 31, stood at Rs 44,933.1 crore, up 9.7% YoY.“We would like to continue to sharpen our strength, continue to hover around RAM portfolio. There are a lot of opportunities we are able to see with a network of semi-urban and urban areas in the system,” Moorthy said.Moorthy said that going ahead the bank will only have  “decent” gross bad loan figures to show. The gross non-performing asset ratio (GNPAs) of TMB Bank stood at 1.69% as of March 31, lower than 3.44% a year ago. Net NPAs, too, were lower at 0.95% as of March end.“With our loan book predominantly lopsided towards secured portion, and on account of small ticket size of loans, risk is getting distributed with some collaterals in place. We should have decent gross NPAs only in the future,” Moorthy said.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/banks/rbi-prodded-bank-for-ipo-will-apply-for-new-branches-post-share-sale-tamilnad-mercantile-bank-md-says-9116381.html,IPO,"For opening a few branches, I think they advised us to get ourselves listed and then approach them for opening new branches,” he added.TMB faces restrictions on opening new branches for failing to raise its subscribed capital to at least half of its authorised share capital line with requirements.When asked whether the bank will approach the RBI after the share sale for expansion of its network, Moorthy said the bank will approach the regulator, but did not share details on the expansion plan.“We will be able to give a guidance (on expansion) post-IPO once we finalise our strategy with board-approved policies in place,” Moorthy said.TMB has a branch network of over 500 branches in both rural and urban areas, with a majority located in southern states.Experts said the regulator does not issue instructions pertaining to IPOs to lenders until it finds material concerns at a bank.“This is a bank-specific restriction.At this point of time, I think we are one of the better players in the market as compared to our peers as of now,” Moorthy said.According to the bank’s FY22 annual report, as of March-end, TMB’s total advances stood at Rs 33,491.54 crore, up 8% Year-on-Year (Y-o-Y).Some 87% of the lender’s total advances were in the retail, agriculture and micro, small and medium enterprises segments (RAM), the MD said without giving any guidance on credit growth.“Post-Covid-19, everyone is euphoric about the GDP of the country.","['RBI', 'Moorthy', 'Moorthy', 'TMB', 'Moorthy', 'TMB', 'Rs', 'RAM']",[]

SoftBank-backed OfBusiness defers IPO plans by 3 months on weak market cues,08 August,"SoftBank-backed OfBusiness, which runs an online marketplace for construction materials and financing for small and medium enterprises, has put off by at least three months its plans to go public following the global market meltdown, CEO Asish Mohapatra has said.OfBusiness, which also counts Matrix Partners and Falcon Edge among its backers, had planned an initial public offering (IPO) by the end of 2022 but may now get listed in the first quarter of the calendar year 2023, he said.“Had the recent meltdown not happened, I think we were hoping to see ourselves on the public bourses in about six to nine months, and I think that has got extended by three to four months,” Mohapatra said during CNN-News18's Bits to Billions show.“It (the original deadline for an IPO) would have been December (2022) or January (2023), that’s when we were thinking, now may be add a quarter to it. I think at our scale, we can’t stay away (from public markets) for too long now,” Mohapatra added.He also said the round raised in December 2021 was OfBusiness’s last private market fundraise.OfBusiness raised $325 million as a part of its Series G funding round led by Falcon Edge, Tiger Global, SoftBank, Norwest Venture Partners, and Matrix Partners, among others. The round valued the company at close to $5 billion.Mohapatra said Oxyzo Financial Services, a company that started as a lending arm of OfBusiness and is promoted by his wife Ruchi Kalra, would go for an IPO six to 12 months after OfBusiness gets listed.The husband-wife duo created history by promoting two unicorns—OfBusiness and Oxyzo—when Oxyzo pocketed $200 million at $1 billion valuation in its Series A round earlier this year. It was one of India’s largest Series A rounds that saw participation from Tiger Global and Falcon Edge among others.“Both companies will independently go (for) IPO and the process of demerging out Oxyzo on a standalone basis will be there.

Together, these firms are expected to mop up Rs 45,000 crore. So far in current fiscal year, 11 companies have gone public to garner Rs 33,254 crore. Of these, a lion's share (Rs 20,557 crore) was raised by the public issue of Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC).All these companies hit the primary market during April-May and not a single public issue was launched after May, suggesting a dry spell in the IPO market. This came after as many as 52 companies tapped the primary market to raise a record Rs 1.11 lakh crore in the entire 2021-22.The impressive fundraising could be due to a slew of public issues from new age loss-making technology startups, strong retail participation and huge listing gains.The lack of appetite for the IPO in current fiscal year could be attributed to sharp correction in the secondary market, disastrous performance of new digital companies, like Paytm and Zomato, and poor post listing performance of LIC negatively impacting the sentiments, VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Financial Services, said.Anand Rathi Investment Banking's Rao also said that due to the volatility in the markets and certain issues facing pricing performance, investors were wary of new issuances.However, Abhijit Tare, MD and CEO, Motilal Oswal Investment Advisors, is of the view that markets have just recovered from mathematical low and more importantly a sentimental low seen in the last quarter and few companies will try to approach markets.A few of the IPOs will get through in the next 2-3 months based on the merit of their proposals, Tare said adding that a good amount of fundraising is expected to happen in the remaining part of the fiscal year.""With good quarter results and some favourable economic data, we feel the second half of this fiscal year might give a few windows for issues to happen and may present an opportunity for good quality companies that have been priced reasonably to launch their IPOs,"" Rao said.Interestingly, there is a sudden rush among companies for filing preliminary IPO papers with Sebi in the last two months.

"Interview: PSU banks out of the woods; IndiaFirst Life Insurance IPO likely by March, says Union Bank MD",01 August,"India’s public sector banks (PSBs) are out of the woods with better earnings momentum and cleaning up of the non-performing assets (NPAs) book, Union Bank of India’s newly appointed managing director and chief executive Officer (MD & CEO) A. Manimekhalai told Moneycontrol in an interaction Monday, August 1.“If you see, PSU banks were always industry leaders, we had lost out somewhere. So now we are picking up, all of them. We were bogged down by NPAs, NPAs are getting cleaned up and our people are working and we are showing the results…,” Manimekhalai said.Seated in her posh corner office at the top floor of historic Union Bank Bhavan building in Mumbai, overlooking Mumbai’s heritage buildings such as Mantralaya and Taj Hotel, Manimekhalai is Union Bank’s first woman MD and CEO, Moneycontrol reported in June.“Hard work and commitment have no gender,” the MD said when asked about the lack of female leaders at India’s premier banks. In this interview, she shared her outlook on Union Bank’s business growth and asset quality for the current fiscal, and also said that IndiaFirst Life Insurance Company (a joint venture where Union Bank holds 9 percent stake), will likely hit the public markets by March. Edited excerpts:What are the key retail loan products you will push for growth in the current year?RAM (retail, agriculture and MSME loans), asset quality, CASA (current account and savings account), and earnings—these are my four major focus areas for the bank. We want to keep the RAM and corporate loan ratio at 56:44, in favour of retail loans...Within RAM loans, housing loans remain our focus area and we also want to extend many education loans. That is another area we are really looking at, we would like to increase those numbers. Presently, total education loans are around Rs 7,000 crore, so we would like to at least double these numbers by March-end.Have you partnered with educational institutes?We are doing a lot of activities for education loans and have talked to all the IIMs (Indian Institutes of Management) and IITs (Indian Institutes of Technology). We have launched two new products for the premier institutes in India and foreign countries, about a month back. We have seen good traction in our IIM education loans. Now IIT admissions will also start, I think, in the next 15-20 days. It will start so we will try to push those numbers also.Will RAM advances maintain double-digit growth?Yes, they will surely do this. We also have a digital product of personal loans for our customers. Our own customers, who have a specific number of CASA balances, we give them a pre-approved loan. We launched this product at the end of May, and we have done close to Rs 300 crore… We also have a subsidiary named UBISL, that is, Union Bank of India Subsidiaries Ltd. We are going to engage people with UBISL who will also act as a DSA (direct selling agents) for the bank and they will also do home loans and others.Vehicle loans we have done very well during the previous quarter, we did about 36 percent growth (year-on-year) and that trajectory will always remain. In home loans, we have seen almost 12 percent growth. So all the areas of retail we will do well. We are looking at the same kind of growth in agricultural loans also. We did around 14 percent (year-on-year growth in Q1), we may not be at 14 percent but we are looking at double-digit growth. We are looking at KCC (Kisan Credit Card scheme), because now is the season for it and we are looking at increasing gold loan advances.There are schemes of the government of India for dairy finance, AIF (agricultural infra financing facility). There are various other products (schemes) of the government that have been launched… We actually have not given it proper thought yet so those numbers will also increase.Will you be doing co-lending of loans with non-banking financial companies?We are aiming Rs 2,000 crore in co-lending this fiscal. Focus areas for co-lending will be RAM products and MSME (micro, small and medium enterprises) loans...Are there any big-ticket loans in the pipeline for Q2FY23?We have done a lot of HAM (hybrid annuity model) projects (for highways), that is what we are aiming at this fiscal. We are also looking at chemical industries, hospital projects, agriculture-processing units.We have done a Rs 2,000 crore loan for the Ganga Expressway… All our projects are mostly less than Rs 1,000 crore. This is a new project.In road projects, it (loan ticket size) is less than Rs 1,000 crore. It is at about Rs 800-900 crore each. We are not looking to tie up with other banks for it.How much will Union Bank’s loan rates rise if the Reserve Bank of India hikes the repo rate?The RBI has already raised it by 90 bps (basis points). We feel that the RBI may line up another 25 bps in the next MPC (monetary policy committee meeting scheduled on Friday)…and this will, of course, be passed on to the customer.And how much will deposit rates rise?We have already raised the deposit rate. The bank’s next ALCO (asset-liability committee) is on August 11, and by that time rates (RBI repo rate) will come. We will have to (increase deposit rates). My deposits growth will be something around 9.5 percent to 10 percent (year-on-year).Will you launch a repo-linked deposit product?As of now, we are not looking at those kinds of rates (offered in repo-lined deposits). We will see how the market behaves… We are now comfortable with our total deposits, if we need more deposits then probably we will come out with these new products.What is the CD ratio that the bank will maintain this fiscal?We are looking at 69 percent to 70 percent CD ratio (credit-deposit ratio).Will NIM improve from 3 percent as of June end?We are expecting NIM (net interest margin) to be around 3.1 percent by March.Your guidance on asset quality?We are targeting up to Rs 13,000 crore in slippages and below 9 percent GNPA (gross NPA) in FY23. Net NPA, about 3 percent is my target. Credit cost will be around that percent (2.02 percent in Q1). Further, we are targeting Rs 14,000-15,000 crore of recoveries this fiscal.How is the restructured pool of assets performing?We did have a bit of stress in large corporate…and some stress in MSME and retail advances. Retail advances, though they show signs of stress, we are able to get them back to the standard assets (category). But MSME advances are little on the stressed side, so that we will have to work out.Will treasury income improve going ahead?We have other sources of income, and we feel that the markets will correct themselves and we may see an upward trend in treasury income at least in September (quarter).Can you provide business growth guidance for your subsidiaries?All of them (subsidiaries) have promised me a number of 2x (business growth). Mutual fund, insurance businesses and others have promised a number of 2x. The last two years were impacted due to Covid-19, and everybody feels they can do much better in the current year…As of now we do not have any monetisation plan. The monetisation was last done in March 2022, and after that we do not have a plan.I think one of our subsidiaries may come out with an IPO (initial public offering) by March 2023, that is IndiaFirst Life Insurance. Now, our stake is reduced to 9 percent in IndiaFirst Life Insurance.Have you appointed merchant bankers for the bank’s planned QIP?We have not started yet… We have received board approval to raise up to Rs 8,100 crore (in FY23) and we have already Rs 1,300 crore, and we will come out with the QIP (qualified institutional placement of shares) in a phased manner.Will the bank be looking at reducing the government’s stake to 75 percent this fiscal?We are looking at that. That is my aspiration, so that I can have a better float and a better market capitalisation.Do you think that asset quality pains are behind PSU banks?We are working hard. PSU banks have also become very aggressive and competitive. Look at them (bank team sitting in office), we have the best of the talents. Digitisation is on the move, we will build on it. We have brought out so many products.If you see, PSU banks were always industry leaders, we had lost out somewhere. So now we are picking up, all of them. We were bogged down by NPAs, NPAs are getting cleaned up and our people are working, and we are showing the results…Can you comment on lack of representation of female leaders in banking sector top roles?Now we have got two appointments in the insurance space, two women have already been appointed. So we will see more women leaders, possibly in the next one or two years.I have always been saying that leadership and competency has got no gender. Hard work and commitment have no gender. One has to work hard to get to wherever you want to get.It is not about, you know, being a women leader or male leader. It is about your competency, whether you can rise to that level.

"Shriram Group may sell minor stake in housing finance arm in next fiscal, says Shriram City Union Finance MD",28 July,"The Shriram Group may sell a part of its 85.02 percent stake in home loan arm Shriram Housing Finance in the next financial year, managing director and chief executive officer (MD & CEO) of Shriram City Union Finance (SCUF) YS Chakravarti told Moneycontrol on July 28.But the sale is unlikely until the mortgage lender reaches assets under management (AUM) size of Rs 8,000 crore to Rs 10,000 crore, he said.“Probably a year from now (the AUM will rise)…There are a lot of options on table, one would be to divest a small portion and then go for an IPO (initial public offering)…,” Chakravarti said.On December 13, the Shriram Group approved the long-anticipated merger of its lending subsidiaries Shriram Capital (SCL) and SCUF with Shriram Transport Finance Co (STFC). The merged entity would be known as Shriram Finance. While STFC Vice-Chairman Umesh Revankar would be the vice-chairman of the merged entity, Chakravarti will be the MD and CEO of Shriram Finance. Shriram Housing Finance is the mortgage lending arm of Shriram Group, promoted by SCUF with 85 percent shareholding as on June end.As of June 30, the housing finance company’s AUM were Rs 5,803 crore, up 48 percent year-on-year (YoY), with total disbursements rising manifold year-on-year to Rs 795 crore during April-June (Q1FY23).“I think there is still time, the first objective is they (Shriram Housing Finance) need to cross Rs 8,000 crore (of AUM). So we will look at something between Rs 8,000 crore to Rs 10,000 crore in AUM. Till such time, we wouldn’t be looking at anything,” the MD said.Merger Moneycontrol on July 28 first reported that the Group has received approval from the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI) for the proposed merger of group companies.Following the approval, Shriram Group companies now require regulatory approvals from the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) and the Competition Commission of India (CCI), Chakravarti told Moneycontrol, adding that the merger will likely be completed by September-end.The merged entity would have a combined AUM of over Rs. 1.5 lakh crore, over 20 million customers served till date and a distribution network of over 3,500 branches. All of these would be serviced by a team of over 50,000 employees.Q1 results Chakravarty’s comments come on the heels of SCUF reporting its April-June (Q1FY23) net profit at Rs 323 crore, up 55 percent year-on-year (YoY) on the back of higher loan disbursements and stable asset quality.SCUF’s total disbursement rose 82 percent YoY to Rs 8,726 crore during April-June, as per its Q1 investor presentation. AUM grew to Rs 40,414 crore as of June-end, up 21 percent YoY and 5 percent sequentially.“The demand across products has revived..

Paytm CEO Vijay Shekhar Sharma seeks to reset fintech pioneer after IPO fiasco,28 July,"Paytm was the poster boy for India’s tech startups, only to lose two-thirds of its value since its IPO and become a symbol of the industry’s crash. Now its founder promises a sharpened focus on financial performance to convince investors of the money-losing company’s prospects.The digital-payments provider is set to become India’s first internet company to hit $1 billion in annual revenue by the end of this fiscal year in March, said Vijay Shekhar Sharma, 44. The brand, known formally as One97 Communications Ltd., is also shifting its attention from growth toward profitability, Sharma said in his first extensive interview following the high-profile public debut in November.“We’re earnestly chasing the $1 billion goal,” he said during an hours-long conversation last week at Paytm’s new chrome-and-glass headquarters in Noida, outside New Delhi, in a vast green expanse filled with wandering cattle. “For me, the public listing was a sort of graduation, and taking Paytm to break-even and to profits gives me a clarity of purpose.”Paytm’s stock-price collapse exacerbated a crisis for India’s startups, sending valuations plummeting as investors began to grow cautious about their earnings potential. Young firms -- dozens of which had hit unicorn status as capital flowed to everything from online retail to digital learning in the country of 1.4 billion -- suddenly saw their fundraising plans grind to a halt. To make matters worse, the war in Ukraine and fears of a global recession further clouded the picture for startups worldwide in 2022.Describing his approach as a rewind-and-reset, Sharma is on a mission to win back investors. And he’ll have his hands full: Paytm’s operating losses widened over the past year to about $350 million, competition is intensifying and investors have lambasted the lack of clarity in the company’s business model.One step toward regaining trust is a demystifying of Paytm’s revenue structure, said the founder, who is also the company’s chief executive officer. He said its work can be simplified to two short lines: Paytm is in the business of payments, and it sells loans.India’s payments market differs from that of more developed countries, as it bypassed card-based systems popular in regions such as Europe and the US to jump directly from cash to mobile device payments. While that’s attracted droves of contenders like Alphabet Inc.’s Google Pay, Amazon.com Inc.’s Amazon Pay and Walmart Inc.’s PhonePe, Sharma is confident Paytm’s products -- some modeled on success cases in other markets -- will help it retain its leadership position.Its Sound Box, for instance, is a $2-a-month subscription which instantly reconciles payments and announces a successful purchase via a speaker at the merchant’s counter. Another product generates a unique QR code for each transaction and lets shoppers pay swiftly through Paytm’s smartphone application as well as other apps -- a model already prevalent in China.“I want to make Paytm the most relevant payments company of our times,” he said, dressed in a checked shirt and blue jeans, seated in a conference room framed against a distant backdrop of high rises.To expand Paytm’s reach, Sharma has steadily ramped up its lending business. While taking on traditional banks is a challenge, Paytm is convinced it’ll win over users in what is currently a credit-starved market.In both payments and lending, Paytm has started to publish more metrics. It’s revealed more data on users, revenue streams and loan disbursals, treating investors on par with board members -- and so far, the numbers have been beating internal expectations, Sharma said.Sharma, who grew up the son of a teacher in the small town of Aligarh in central India, founded Paytm parent One97 Communications over two decades ago. The company began offering digital payments in 2014, and has since snared a who’s who of global investors including Masayoshi Son’s SoftBank Group Corp., Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. and Jack Ma’s Ant Group Co., growing into the country’s most ubiquitous payments brand.If the early years were challenging, this has been Paytm’s most grueling phase ever. The IPO shone light on Paytm’s business model, allowing investors to more closely scrutinize the company’s earnings logic and valuation. The founder defended both, citing the successful listings of internet peers like Nykaa and Zomato Ltd. and bankers’ advice on the maturity of Paytm’s revenue model. Paytm plunged 27% on the first day and is currently down more than 60% from its IPO price.“On hindsight, the pricing and the timing look haywire,” said Sharma. “Used to private exits where things are a lot more under control, we weren’t prepared for this.”In the past months, Sharma has told investors that his strategy will allow Paytm to reach operational break-even by September 2023. The company has slashed spending and is considering an exit from a pricey cricket sponsorship and terminating an agreement to acquire insurer Raheja QBE General Insurance.“Earlier the team used to be like, ‘Cricket sponsorship? that’s so cool!’ to now, ‘How much money can we save if we gave that up?’” the CEO said.Skeptics say profitability will remain an uphill battle. Analysts at Macquarie Capital Securities (India) Pvt., who were early to predict Paytm’s stock decline, said in March that the shares would plummet further to 450 rupees. Sharma said board member and early investor Ravi Adusumalli, founder of Elevation Capital, recently told him he’d prefer $1 billion in profit over $1 billion in revenue.Putting his money where his mouth is, Sharma said his personal stock grants will vest only after the shares stay sustainably above the IPO offer price.“I’m going to be the last person to be paid in this company,” he said. “One day soon, we will get our due.”",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/paytm-ceo-vijay-shekhar-sharma-seeks-to-reset-fintech-pioneer-after-ipo-fiasco-8907311.html,IPO,"And he’ll have his hands full: Paytm’s operating losses widened over the past year to about $350 million, competition is intensifying and investors have lambasted the lack of clarity in the company’s business model.One step toward regaining trust is a demystifying of Paytm’s revenue structure, said the founder, who is also the company’s chief executive officer.Another product generates a unique QR code for each transaction and lets shoppers pay swiftly through Paytm’s smartphone application as well as other apps -- a model already prevalent in China.“I want to make Paytm the most relevant payments company of our times,” he said, dressed in a checked shirt and blue jeans, seated in a conference room framed against a distant backdrop of high rises.To expand Paytm’s reach, Sharma has steadily ramped up its lending business.",[],"['$1 billion', '$1 billion', '1.4 billion', 'about $350 million', '2', '$1 billion', '$1 billion']"
ECGC IPO likely to hit market in fourth quarter of FY23: CMD,26 July,"ECGC Ltd’s Chairman-cum-Managing Director (CMD) M Senthilnathan on July 26 said the listing of the export credit agency on the stock exchange is likely to happen in the last quarter of the current fiscal.Last year, the government had said that it would start the process to list the state-owned entity soon, and the Initial Public Offering (IPO) would hit the market during the next financial year.According to Senthilnathan, the Department of Investment and Public Asset Management (DIPAM) had mentioned that the listing of ECGC will happen after the IPO of Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC).

The state-owned entity on July 26 introduced a new scheme to provide enhanced export credit risk insurance cover to the extent of 90 per cent to support small exporters under the Export Credit Insurance for Banks Whole Turnover Packaging Credit and Post Shipment (ECIB-WTPC & PS).The scheme is expected to benefit a number of small-scale exporters availing of export credit with banks which hold the ECGC WT-ECIB covers. It will enable the small exporters to explore new markets/new buyers and diversify their existing product portfolio competitively. ""We expect this to bring up the percentage of accounts with up to Rs 20 crore, thereby lending further stability to the ECGC portfolio,"" Senthilnathan said. ""By giving 90 per cent cover to banks, we expect more small companies to get export credit from banks, benefiting these industries greatly. We expect banks to provide more concessions. The net effect will be a benefit to exporters, involving a reduction in interest rate,"" he said.This new scheme will enable the banks holding ECGC’s WT-ECIB cover to explore the possibility of reducing interest rates further. This new scheme will enable the banks holding ECGC’s WT-ECIB cover to explore the possibility of reducing interest rates further.The enhanced cover percentage shall be made available to State Bank of India as per the previous year’s premium rate in view of its favourable claim premium ratio, a release said. However, for other banks there may be a moderate increase in the prevailing premium rates, it said.The enhanced cover shall be available for manufacturer-exporters availing fund-based export credit working capital limit up to Rs 20 crore, excluding the gems, jewellery and diamond sector and merchant exporters, the release said.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/ipo/ecgc-ipo-likely-to-hit-market-in-fourth-quarter-of-fy23-cmd-8894211.html,IPO,"ECGC Ltd’s Chairman-cum-Managing Director (CMD) M Senthilnathan on July 26 said the listing of the export credit agency on the stock exchange is likely to happen in the last quarter of the current fiscal.Last year, the government had said that it would start the process to list the state-owned entity soon, and the Initial Public Offering (IPO) would hit the market during the next financial year.According to Senthilnathan, the Department of Investment and Public Asset Management (DIPAM) had mentioned that the listing of ECGC will happen after the IPO of Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC).The state-owned entity on July 26 introduced a new scheme to provide enhanced export credit risk insurance cover to the extent of 90 per cent to support small exporters under the Export Credit Insurance for Banks Whole Turnover Packaging Credit and Post Shipment (ECIB-WTPC & PS).The scheme is expected to benefit a number of small-scale exporters availing of export credit with banks which hold the ECGC WT-ECIB covers.","['ECGC Ltd’s', 'the Initial Public Offering', 'IPO', 'Senthilnathan', 'the Department of Investment and Public Asset Management', 'DIPAM', 'Life Insurance Corporation of India', 'the Export Credit Insurance for Banks Whole Turnover Packaging Credit and Post Shipment', 'ECIB-WTPC & PS).The']","['90 per cent', '90 per cent']"

"Porsche IPO, Tesla chase, software fix: What awaits VW’s new CEO",25 July,"As much of Volkswagen AG takes a summer break the next few weeks, Oliver Blume, the carmaker’s designated chief executive officer, will be staring down an extensive to-do list.A diverse set of pressing issues await the 53-year-old ascending to the job Herbert Diess has been ousted from. Lead among them will be listing Porsche AG -- VW’s most prized asset -- amid the worst climate for initial public offerings in years, and fixing protracted problems at the software division postponing new electric Porsches and Audis.Diess’s aggressive strategies for EVs, software and new-mobility offerings set VW on a path the company’s billionaire owners praised even as they pushed him out of the CEO role. It’s now up to Blume to follow through in transforming the world’s second-biggest carmaker to better contend with up-and-coming Tesla Inc. and incumbents Toyota Motor Corp. and Stellantis NV.Here are some of the challenges awaiting Blume:Taking Porsche PublicThe industrial logic behind listing a minority stake in VW group’s most profitable major brand is sound. The IPO, which could be Europe’s largest ever, must succeed to finally boost VW’s languishing valuation.But in addition to governance concerns, there’s growing fear that recession risks, surging energy costs and geopolitical tension ultimately will drag on Porsche’s valuation. In 2019, VW’s listing of its truck unit Traton SE was a disappointment.Harnessing SoftwareVW’s efforts to build its own software operation has been a bruising experience of strategy shifts, executive purges and product delays.Tesla is way ahead in regularly deploying over-the-air updates that add capabilities and improve the performance of its EVs after they leave the showroom, and attempts by traditional rivals like Toyota to replicate this have been less messy. Seizing the opportunities software brings, including new forms of revenue, will be the industry’s next frontier.Keeping US Growth GoingVW has finally stopped losing money in America, but the company remains a long way from closing the gap to Toyota, General Motors Co. or Ford Motor Co. To better compete with those market leaders and upstarts like Rivian Automotive Inc., the automaker is reviving the off-road brand Scout that will offer an electric pickup and rugged SUV.As for the luxury segment, Audi has long sought to take on Mercedes-Benz AG and BMW AG on a global scale, but has no production footprint in the US.Turning China AroundVW has been losing share in its biggest market due to poor handling of the chip shortage and a dearth of digital features that China’s tech-savvy drivers have increasingly come to expect.Tesla’s new Shanghai factory isn’t the only thorn in VW’s side, as local manufacturers’ products also are catching on. VW can’t afford dwindling profits from the Chinese ventures it’s counting on to finance its EV ambitions.Challenging TeslaWhereas VW has flailed during the chip crisis and struggled to keep production lines running, the US electric-car maker has maintained steady growth through the supply-chain turmoil.After quickly turning the Shanghai plant into its most productive globally, CEO Elon Musk has added factories in Austin, Texas, and near Berlin this year. Tesla’s aggressive expansion is making VW’s electric-car project Trinity, which includes a 2 billion-euro ($2 billion) German factory, look all the more critical.Containing ControversyWithin days of being named the new CEO, Blume apologized for comments he made during an internal event last month about Christian Lindner, Germany’s finance minister.Blume boasted that he had been constantly exchanging messages with Lindner months ago when the government was negotiating a coalition agreement allowing for new vehicles in the coming years to be powered by synthetic fuels, which aren’t as clean as EVs.

A 79-year-old tech pioneer Ashok Soota aims for his third startup IPO,22 July,"Ashok Soota has spent four decades in India’s technology industry, headed three prominent IT companies and taken two of them public. Now, the 79-year-old is getting his newest venture off the ground with a goal to take it to IPO in five years.When Soota turns 80 in November, Happiest Health will be a rare Indian technology startup with an octogenarian founder. He is basing the startup on his holistic view on health and wellbeing, while drawing inspiration from Berkshire Hathaway Inc.’s Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger -- who are plowing ahead in their nineties.“They embody the canon that work is exercise for the mind,” Soota said in an interview this week on the roof garden of his sweeping Bangalore home, seated amid flowering orchids and a large aquarium full of fish.Located in the viridescent Koramangala neighborhood, the residence isn’t far from where India’s IT outsourcing businesses first set up decades ago. Soota played key roles in building what’s become a $227 billion industry.He was brought in to steer Wipro Ltd. in 1984 and went on to make a success of its outsourcing business while largely staying in the shadow of its charismatic chairman, billionaire Azim Premji. Soota quit in 1999 to co-found rival IT services company Mindtree Ltd., bringing it to an initial public offering in 2007.He then did a repeat by founding digital services-focused outsourcer Happiest Minds Technologies Ltd. in 2011. As executive chairman, he led it to a public debut in 2020 amid the pandemic, entering billionaire ranks when its market value surpassed $2.5 billion last year.Soota-founded ventures have recently faced headwinds along with the broader tech sector. Happiest Minds, of which Soota owns about 53%, has lost a quarter of its value this year for a current market capitalization of $1.8 billion. Mindtree is down about a third.On the surface, Soota isn’t perturbed. His latest startup, Happiest Health, aspires to be a Google-meets-WebMD-meets-Mayo Clinic venture that helps people navigate mental and physical health. It lets customers access health information that has thus far been hard to find, particularly on treatments and therapies melding Western and Eastern practices.Happiest Health aims to eventually combine modern medicine and research with gentler therapies like Ayurveda, naturopathy, yoga and meditation via short videos, newsletters, webinars and paid-for events.Bootstrapped by Soota, the company has 90 employees, including doctors, scientists and writers. Soota is building the business based on his background in overseeing hundreds of thousands of employees and his experiences with their wellbeing, work-life balance and relationship issues.“For decades, Ashok Soota spotted IT services trends and figured out how to stay ahead,” said Thomas George, president of researcher CyberMedia Research. “He’s now chasing a new challenge.”Soota walks about five miles every morning followed by 30 minutes of laps in his pool. He also practices yoga a couple of times a week.The serial entrepreneur hinted he may still have a startup idea or two up his sleeve. “The median age of India’s technology workforce is 26 or 27 years,” said Soota. “Being around them keeps me young and full of plans.”",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/world/a-79-year-old-tech-pioneer-ashok-soota-aims-for-his-third-startup-ipo-8867521.html,IPO,"He is basing the startup on his holistic view on health and wellbeing, while drawing inspiration from Berkshire Hathaway Inc.’s Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger -- who are plowing ahead in their nineties.“They embody the canon that work is exercise for the mind,” Soota said in an interview this week on the roof garden of his sweeping Bangalore home, seated amid flowering orchids and a large aquarium full of fish.Located in the viridescent Koramangala neighborhood, the residence isn’t far from where India’s IT outsourcing businesses first set up decades ago.Soota played key roles in building what’s become a $227 billion industry.He was brought in to steer Wipro Ltd. in 1984 and went on to make a success of its outsourcing business while largely staying in the shadow of its charismatic chairman, billionaire Azim Premji.","['Berkshire Hathaway Inc.’s', 'Wipro Ltd.', 'Azim Premji']","['$227 billion', '$2.5 billion', '$1.8 billion']"
India's PharmEasy plans $200 million fund raising at lower valuation: sources,19 July,"Indian drug and medical services startup PharmEasy is in talks with investors to raise $200 million, but at a valuation that could be 15% or even 25% lower than last year's $5.1 billion, two people with direct knowledge of deal talks told Reuters.Signalling growing stress in India's startup ecosystem, one source said PharmEasy, backed by big-name investors such as Prosus, TPG and Temasek, is in talks to secure the new funds at a valuation as much as 15% below last year's.A second source said the company, which offers online medicine deliveries and diagnostic test services, has told its bankers to consider even a 25% reduction if needed to close the deal. That could cut PharmEasy's valuation for the new funding round to $3.8 billion, and the sources said an initial public offering (IPO) first targeted for 2022 has been delayed.Indian startups have been jolted by uncertain global and domestic stock markets, and growing investor scepticism over what they say are sky-high valuations, making it difficult for PharmEasy to raise funds at same or a higher valuation, the sources said. They declined to be named as the talks on raising funds were private.PharmEasy's planned fund raising is set to see participation from some existing investors, who have indicated they will commit about $115 million in the new round, said the first source involved in the talks.API Holdings, PharmEasy's parent company which is looking to raise the funds, declined to comment. API owns other businesses including diagnostic test provider Thyrocare.The company had seen its valuation jump in recent years in a boom moment for India's startups in general and a growth surge in its own sector, where rivals include Reliance's Netmeds, Tata's 1mg and Walmart's Flipkart.Last year, Indian startups raised a record $35 billion in private funding and many internet companies went public. PharmEasy, too, cashed in on the boom raised a total of $1.89 billion since 2015, with most of it coming in the last two years, data from Pitchbook shows.Among high-profile Indian startups, a 'down round' deal by PharmEasy's - when a firm sells shares at a lower valuation than before - will be the first in recent times.Bank of America Securities and Morgan Stanley are working on the deal, said the sources. Morgan Stanley declined comment, while Bank of America did not respond.IPO on hold, mounting lossesBetting on higher healthcare spends and growing use of online ordering, API Holdings last year filed a prospectus to raise 62.5 billion rupees ($782 million) in an IPO, hoping to list in 2022. The sources confirmed that plan is now delayed.One concern among investors before the market debut is mounting losses of the digital pharmacy, the sources said.PharmEasy's parent saw its total income more than double to $714 million in the fiscal year to March 2022.But total expenses for the period amounted to $1.06 billion, partly due to a one-time employee stock benefits outlay, according to a document viewed by Reuters that listed PharmEasy's latest unaudited financials.The net loss for the year quadrupled to $334 million, the document stated.PharmEasy is currently in a ""wait and watch"" mode and considering listing next year, the first source said. A third person with knowledge of the matter also said the IPO may only take place late in 2023, and PharmEasy's parent may be required to refile IPO regulatory papers.The IPO delay comes as stocks of prominent Indian listings of last year, such as digital payments firm Paytm and food-delivery firm Zomato, have fallen more than 60% from their peaks.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/indias-pharmeasy-plans-200-million-fund-raising-at-lower-valuationsources-8849971.html,IPO,"Indian drug and medical services startup PharmEasy is in talks with investors to raise $200 million, but at a valuation that could be 15% or even 25% lower than last year's $5.1 billion, two people with direct knowledge of deal talks told Reuters.Signalling growing stress in India's startup ecosystem, one source said PharmEasy, backed by big-name investors such as Prosus, TPG and Temasek, is in talks to secure the new funds at a valuation as much as 15% below last year's.A second source said the company, which offers online medicine deliveries and diagnostic test services, has told its bankers to consider even a 25% reduction if needed to close the deal.The sources confirmed that plan is now delayed.One concern among investors before the market debut is mounting losses of the digital pharmacy, the sources said.PharmEasy's parent saw its total income more than double to $714 million in the fiscal year to March 2022.But total expenses for the period amounted to $1.06 billion, partly due to a one-time employee stock benefits outlay, according to a document viewed by Reuters that listed PharmEasy's latest unaudited financials.The net loss for the year quadrupled to $334 million, the document stated.PharmEasy is currently in a ""wait and watch"" mode and considering listing next year, the first source said.","['PharmEasy', 'Reuters', 'PharmEasy', 'Prosus', 'TPG', 'PharmEasy', 'Reuters', 'PharmEasy', 'PharmEasy']","['$200 million', '$5.1 billion', '$3.8 billion', 'about $115 million', 'a record $35 billion', '$1.89 billion', '62.5 billion', '$782 million', '$714 million', '$1.06 billion', '$334 million']"

"Will think on IPOs of HDFC Securities, HDB Financial Services after merger with HDFC: HDFC MD",16 July,"HDFC Bank will be looking at the public listing of its brokerage and non-bank finance company subsidiaries only after its merger with parent HDFC Ltd goes through, a top official said on July 16.Answering shareholder queries at the 28th annual general meeting of the largest private sector lender, its chief executive and managing director Sashidhar Jagdishan said the initial public offering (IPO) plans for HDFC Securities and HDB Financial Services depends on the merger process.HDFC Bank and HDFC in April announced the USD 40 billion merger, touted as the largest such transaction in corporate history, saying that it will take up to 18 months to end. ""The IPO plans (of HDFC Securities and HDB Financial Services) are something that we will contemplate after we have absorbed (the merger) we’ve got directions from the regulator, after we absorb as and when the merger happens. And then we will think about"", Jagdishan said.Earlier, he said that on HDB Financial Services, the bank is still awaiting directions from the regulator to ascertain a glide path for the way ahead for the company, which reported a huge jump in post-tax net at Rs 441.3 crore for June quarter. In the case of HDFC Securities, the bank would like to maintain a majority stake given the complementarity in business offerings with the brokerage whose customers are the same as the bank’s, the CEO said.The decision on whether to keep the stake at the current 95 per cent or dilute it will be taken in due course of time, Jagdishan said. Despite approval from the RBI, the bank has shelved its plans to invest more in HDFC Ergo General Insurance, pending the merger with HDFC, after which the insurer will become a subsidiary of the bank itself, Jagdishan said.Once the merger goes through, the bank will also have to look at increasing the maturity profile of its liabilities which are currently below three years, Jagdishan said, explaining that the mortgage assets are typically longer term in nature due to which the bank’s asset liability committee will have to take the appropriate calls. He said the overall composition of housing loans of the merged entity will be 35 per cent and hinted at doing more of the same product as well by stating that it does not see this as concentration risk. On one side, the under-penetration presents an opportunity, while on the other side, other loan products of the bank will also be growing, he underlined.The bank is also keen to patronize the deposit agents of HDFC after the merger, but will await regulatory clarity on the same, he said. The bank, which had to face slaps from the regulator in the recent past because of outages faced by customers, is planning to soon launch a payments app which will be better than its current offering called Payzapp and include features including instant credit of cashbacks, Jagdishan said.He said from July or August onward, it plans to launch one new digital offering every three to four weeks, which will also include a new mobile app for corporate and small business clients, and added that it has already soft-launched a customer experience hub sans much of fanfare. On the credit card front, the bank has made sizeable progress since being allowed to sell new cards after the ban, the CEO said.The overall number of cards stands at 17-18 million and HDFC Bank’s market share in the overall receivables has gone up to 47-48 percent, he said, adding that from a profitability perspective, it will be back at the pre-COVID levels in the next 6-8 months. The bank is also cognizant of data privacy issues and has recently appointed a chief data officer, who will be working along with a chief data security officer, Jagdishan said, adding that its entire data mining operation starts with getting consent from the customer first, and it will be compliant with Indian regulations on this front as and when they come in.From the perspective of minimising the downtimes, the bank will be investing more on the technology front going ahead, he said, without giving details on the quantum of the money to be invested. In the last two years, the bank has seen an increase in the corporate loans in the overall loan book, which has led to a dip in the net interest margins to 4 percent levels, Jagdishan said, adding that the crucial number influencing profitability to go up to 4.2 percent once the share of retail advances goes up.There have been higher loan losses on the retail loans front during the last two years of the pandemic, he said, adding that similar trends were observed after the global financial crisis in FY09 and also after demonetization as individuals faced difficulties in their financial situations. The bank’s attrition has gone up to 19 per cent with the reopening of the economy post the pandemic-induced slowdown, Jagdsihan said, adding that the number is embarrassingly: higher among the youngsters and efforts will be made to reduce the same.The bank has the approval to open a branch in Singapore and after the merger with HDFC, the number of foreign branches may go up, he said, stressing that it sees India as a key opportunity and does not see a significant increase in its global footprint, which currently consists of branches in Bahrain, Hong Kong, Dubai and Gift City. Meanwhile, the bank’s non-executive chairman Atanu Chakraborty said it is looking at doubling its branch network to over 12,000 over the next 3-5 years, and the sizes of branches may reduce over time.Typically, it takes two years for a branch in a metro city to break even, while the same for other pockets is around three years, he said.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/banks/will-think-on-ipos-of-hdfc-securities-hdb-financial-services-after-merger-with-hdfc-hdfc-md-8838351.html,IPO,"Despite approval from the RBI, the bank has shelved its plans to invest more in HDFC Ergo General Insurance, pending the merger with HDFC, after which the insurer will become a subsidiary of the bank itself, Jagdishan said.Once the merger goes through, the bank will also have to look at increasing the maturity profile of its liabilities which are currently below three years, Jagdishan said, explaining that the mortgage assets are typically longer term in nature due to which the bank’s asset liability committee will have to take the appropriate calls.In the last two years, the bank has seen an increase in the corporate loans in the overall loan book, which has led to a dip in the net interest margins to 4 percent levels, Jagdishan said, adding that the crucial number influencing profitability to go up to 4.2 percent once the share of retail advances goes up.There have been higher loan losses on the retail loans front during the last two years of the pandemic, he said, adding that similar trends were observed after the global financial crisis in FY09 and also after demonetization as individuals faced difficulties in their financial situations.","['RBI', 'HDFC Ergo General Insurance', 'HDFC']","['95 per cent', '35 per cent', '19 per cent']"

"No free meals for employees, founders and management to take salary cuts: Unacademy's path to profitability",11 July,"In a bid to prioritise profitability over growth ahead of a potential initial public offering (IPO) in two years, edtech unicorn Unacademy has taken steps such as paycuts for founders and management, put travel restrictions on employees and stopped complimentary meals and snacks at their offices.Employees, including CXOs (top management) will not be provided business class treatment for travel and anyone who wants an upgrade can pay from their own pocket, Gaurav Munjal, Unacademy's co-founder and chief executive officer, said in an internal note to employees, a copy of which was viewed by Moneycontrol.Munjal further said that certain privileges such as dedicated drivers for CXOs will also be removed. Founders have already taken a salary cut and management will also take a salary cut, he added.""We will be shutting down certain businesses that have failed to find PMF (product market fit) like Global Test Prep,"" Munjal said.Munjal also said that the company should embrace 'frugality' as a core value from now.""Until now we have never had frugality as one of our core values. Honestly, since we were focused on growth and the fact that we had raised millions of dollars of capital it (frugality) wasn’t a priority,"" Munjal said in the internal note.""But now the goal has changed. We have to do an IPO (initial public offering) in the next two years. And we have to turn cashflow positive. For that we must embrace frugality as a core value,"" Munjal added.Munjal further said that Unacademy is 'not efficient' at all, as it spends crores on travel for employees and educators. Munjal claimed that the company had more than Rs 2,800 crore in the bank as of this morning.""Sometimes it’s (travel is) needed, sometimes it’s not. There are a lot of unnecessary expenses that we do. We must cut all these expenses. We have a strong core business. We must turn profitable asap,"" Munjal said.Unacademy declined to comment.This is Munjal's second message to employees in the last two months. In May, Munjal had warned employees of a potential 'funding winter' and had asked them to work under 'constraints.'“We are looking at a time where funding will dry up for at least 12-18 months. Some people are predicting that this might last 24 months,” Munjal had said on May 26.“We have a different Iconic Goal this time. The Goal is of Profitability.

Overall profitability, however, is expected to remain steady cushioned by a reduction in credit costs, it said.In terms of asset growth, Muthoottu Mini is expecting to reach total assets under management (AUM) of up to Rs 8,000 crore by 2027, Managing Director Mathew Muthoottu, said. As on March end, the NBFC’s total AUM stood at Rs 2,499 crore.Further, during the current fiscal, the NBFC will increase its presence in central and northern regions, opening a total of 130 new branches, the MD said.“We will open 130 branches, various territories including Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Mumbai, Delhi-NCR, Uttar Pradesh, Haryana…north and central is where we are trying to expand,” he added.As on March 31, 2022, the gross NPA and net NPA of Muthoottu Mini stood at 0.61 per cent and 0.52 per cent, respectively.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/banks/will-borrow-up-to-rs-3200-crore-from-banks-ncds-in-fy23-aim-for-ipo-post-2027-say-muthoottu-mini-officials-8800081.html,IPO,"Earlier, we had seven bank partners, but now we have 19-20 banks supporting us, and that really is cheaper also…What we are looking at is Rs 1,600 crore in NCDs and Rs 1,600 crore through bank loans this fiscal,” said the NBFC’s Chief Executive Officer PE Mathai.As per rating agency CRISIL, borrowing costs for NBFCs will likely rise 85-105 basis points (bps) this fiscal.As on March end, the NBFC’s total AUM stood at Rs 2,499 crore.Further, during the current fiscal, the NBFC will increase its presence in central and northern regions, opening a total of 130 new branches, the MD said.“We will open 130 branches, various territories including Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Mumbai, Delhi-NCR, Uttar Pradesh, Haryana…north and central is where we are trying to expand,” he added.As on March 31, 2022, the gross NPA and net NPA of Muthoottu Mini stood at 0.61 per cent and 0.52 per cent, respectively.","['CRISIL', 'AUM', 'Andhra Pradesh', 'Delhi-NCR', 'Uttar Pradesh', 'NPA']","['0.61 per cent', '0.52 per cent']"
Here are Asia’s biggest IPOs to watch for the second half,07 July,"It’s been a rather quiet first six months of the year for initial public offerings in Asia, as the region got swept up in the market rout caused by raging inflation and hawkish monetary policies. But with green shoots starting to sprout in some markets, there are some large deals on the horizon.Share sales globally plummeted some 70% from a year ago in the first half, to levels not seen in almost two decades, as investors and issuers shied away from volatile markets. IPOs in Asia fared better than in regions such as Europe and the US, with large deals in China and South Korea helping listings here account for almost 60% of global volumes, data compiled by Bloomberg show.Now, a world-beating rally in Chinese and Hong Kong stocks has brightened the outlook for the second half, while large listings are being readied from Japan to South Korea and Southeast Asia.Here are among the largest potential Asian listings for the second half of 2022:1. Syngenta GroupThe seed and fertilizer giant owned by China National Chemical Corp. is considering launching its mega IPO in Shanghai before the end of the year, paving the way for what would be one of the world’s biggest listings this year. Syngenta could seek to raise 65 billion yuan ($9.7 billion) on the Nasdaq-style Star Board. At that size, it would rank as second-largest globally behind South Korea’s LG Energy Solution’s $10.7 billion IPO in January.2. OfBusinessIndian startup OfBusiness, founded by a husband and wife, is in discussions about raising $2 billion in an IPO that would be the nation’s biggest tech debut since fintech giant Paytm went public last year, Bloomberg News has reported. The company, which helps Indian enterprises buy bulk raw materials, could go public in six months to a year, one of the co-founders said in April. It doesn’t help that Paytm’s debut was a disaster, with the company shedding more than 60% of its market value since November and clouding the outlook for future startup IPOs in India.3. BeerCoThai Beverage Pcl’s brewery unit, which has twice tried to go public in Singapore, is going for third time lucky. BeerCo started gauging investor demand for its potential IPO last month which could raise $800 million to $1 billion, Bloomberg News has reported. The maker of Chang beer has had to pause its listings plans twice over the past two years due to the pandemic, with lockdowns affecting its business. It had originally been seeking to raise $2 billion, but has had to temper its fundraising ambitions.4. K BankSouth Korean online-only bank K Bank has applied for preliminary approval for a domestic IPO that could raise about $1 billion, IFR reported, citing unidentified people with the matter. The company is planning to bring the deal as early as this year, which would make it the biggest offering since LG Energy Solution. South Korea hasn’t seen an IPO larger than $100 million since then, while foreign investors have been exiting the market en masse, selling $9.6 billion during the second quarter. The country’s stocks are now this year’s worst performers among Asia’s major markets.5. Rakuten BankThe banking arm of Japanese online retailer Rakuten Group Inc. applied this week to list on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. IFR reported that the IPO could raise about $1 billion. Japan has not seen a $1 billion-plus offering in more than three years, when SoftBank Group Corp.’s telecommunications business raised $21.1 billion in December 2018.6. China Tourism Group Duty Free Corp.The world’s largest travel retailer could relaunch its planned Hong Kong listing as early as August or September after it refiled its application last week, Bloomberg News reported. CTG Duty Free -- already traded in Shanghai -- could raise around $2 billion to $3 billion which would make it the city’s biggest offering of the year.7. Ant Group Co.What would potentially be the most high-profile IPO -- if it comes to pass -- is a comeback of Jack Ma’s Ant Group listing, almost two years after it was abruptly pulled. Chinese financial regulators have started early stage discussions on a potential revival of the listing, Bloomberg News reported last month, which would mark a major dialing back of a crackdown on the country’s tech industry. To be sure, Ant would require a lot of regulatory approvals to resurrect its IPO -- which had been set to be the world’s largest ever -- and China’s securities regulator said it isn’t conducting work on reviving the share sale.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/world/here-are-asias-biggest-ipos-to-watch-for-the-second-half-8792971.html,IPO,"IPOs in Asia fared better than in regions such as Europe and the US, with large deals in China and South Korea helping listings here account for almost 60% of global volumes, data compiled by Bloomberg show.Now, a world-beating rally in Chinese and Hong Kong stocks has brightened the outlook for the second half, while large listings are being readied from Japan to South Korea and Southeast Asia.Here are among the largest potential Asian listings for the second half of 2022:1.Syngenta GroupThe seed and fertilizer giant owned by China National Chemical Corp. is considering launching its mega IPO in Shanghai before the end of the year, paving the way for what would be one of the world’s biggest listings this year.","['GroupThe', 'China National Chemical Corp.', 'IPO']","['65 billion yuan', '$9.7 billion', '$10.7 billion', '$2 billion', '$800 million to $1 billion', '$2 billion', 'about $1 billion', '$9.6 billion', 'about $1 billion', '$1 billion', '$21.1 billion', 'around $2 billion to $3 billion']"
Media tech unicorn Amagi aims to IPO in India: Co-founder Baskar Subramanian,08 July,"Media-tech software-as-a-service (SaaS) startup Amagi aims to IPO in India whenever it plans to make its public market debut, says cofounder Baskar Subramanian.""India's become a very robust economy. I'm sure all of us have seen the IPOs and hopefully, this downturn comes back eventually. But we think there's a lot more understanding of these business models that's starting to happen,"" Subramanian said in an episode of CNN-News18's Bits to Billions.""The sophistication of the retail investors as well as the availability of FIIs (Foreign institutional investors) from across the globe in India right now is as good as NASDAQ to an extent. So we see that the robustness of the market exists here to go for a public listing in India itself,"" he said.This remark comes at a time when several Indian startups, especially those in the SaaS industry, are flipping to the United States with an ambition to eventually list in the United States. Flipping refers to domestic startups transferring their intellectual properties (IP) and other assets to an overseas entity and relegating its local entity into a subsidiary.For most of the startups, this is a matter of convenience, since the United States tends to be their primary market and most of their investors are also based in the same region, making it easier for future fundraises. However, this also means a huge loss in IP and overall wealth creation for investors in India as well as loss of tax to the government.Over the past year, India has also seen a wave of domestic public market debuts from tech unicorns including Zomato, Nykaa, Delhivery, and Paytm among others.While the United States is the biggest market for Amagi, accounting for about 74 percent of its revenues and the company is also headquartered in New York, Subramanian says the domicile of the company is an India-based entity and every other overseas entity is a subsidiary of the Indian company as of today.Read: India is 18 months away from fundamental change in online video advertising: Amagi co-founderAmagi, which enables content owners to launch, distribute and monetise live linear channels on free-ad-supported television and video services platforms through a suite of solutions, entered the startup unicorn club with a $95 million fundraise led by Accel in March 2022. Unicorns are companies with a valuation of $1 billion or more.'Profitability is an addictive phenomenon'The Bengaluru-based startup, which was founded by Subramanian, Srinivasan KA and Srividhya Srinivasan in 2008, is among the few unicorns which is profitable while clocking a significant revenue growth in the past year, driven by a 59% surge in new customers in 2021.Amagi saw its revenue from operations grow more than two-fold to Rs 219.3 crore during FY21 from Rs 96.1 crore in FY20. It posted a net profit of Rs 20.7 crore for FY21.""Profitability is an addictive phenomenon. Once you become profitable, you want to be profitable because that gives a lot of freedom from an entrepreneur standpoint, you don't need to be worried about other people's money and how you use them"" Subramanian said.He also mentioned that innovation actually happens when one is frugal in a lot of cases. ""I think that helped us a lot. Maybe, we are one of the few startups that have raised the least amount of money we've raised in terms of the overall money that we've raised and what we spent from a company standpoint. Even today, all the money that we have raised is in the bank, we're not spending the money, because the company is profitable and we don't have burn in the company"" Subramanian said.The company plans to use the funds raised largely for the potential acquisitions it intends to do in the future.""We were starting to disrupt the market about five, six years back in this business, I'm sure there's yet another 24 year old sitting somewhere else figuring out the next best thing to happen. So our paranoia is somebody's going to disrupt us"" Subramanian said.""How do we kind of get to acquire and get to learn from new entrepreneurs coming on board and be able to be part of this whole equation, and then build it together because we are trying to build something sustainably for a 25-30 year period. So for that reason, we are actually raising money largely to acquire talent, new thought processes, innovations, and new gaps that we cannot accomplish"" he added.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/media-tech-unicorn-amagi-aims-to-ipo-in-india-co-founder-baskar-subramanian-8776391.html,IPO,"However, this also means a huge loss in IP and overall wealth creation for investors in India as well as loss of tax to the government.Over the past year, India has also seen a wave of domestic public market debuts from tech unicorns including Zomato, Nykaa, Delhivery, and Paytm among others.While the United States is the biggest market for Amagi, accounting for about 74 percent of its revenues and the company is also headquartered in New York, Subramanian says the domicile of the company is an India-based entity and every other overseas entity is a subsidiary of the Indian company as of today.Read: India is 18 months away from fundamental change in online video advertising: Amagi co-founderAmagi, which enables content owners to launch, distribute and monetise live linear channels on free-ad-supported television and video services platforms through a suite of solutions, entered the startup unicorn club with a $95 million fundraise led by Accel in March 2022.Even today, all the money that we have raised is in the bank, we're not spending the money, because the company is profitable and we don't have burn in the company"" Subramanian said.The company plans to use the funds raised largely for the potential acquisitions it intends to do in the future.","['IP', 'Nykaa', 'Amagi']","['$95 million', '$1 billion']"

"Profitability first, then IPO, so you don’t have to sell your story much to the public: Meesho’s Vidit Aatrey",29 June,"Meesho will look to do a public listing only once it achieves company-level profitability as selling a story to public market investors becomes easier if a company has profit on its books, according to the social-commerce unicorn’s co-founder and chief executive officer Vidit Aatrey.“We have taken a goal and that’s profitability, and only after that we will be doing an IPO,” Aatrey told Moneycontrol, speaking on the sidelines of T-Hub Innovation Summit.“It’s not like we have to do it before it and then sell the story to the public. Our plan is to do it at the right time. Our goal is to still do it within the next two years, end of next year maybe, but that will depend on the market. No point in doing one if the market is not big, right? But our goal is to be ready (for IPO) by then as a company, we can be ready by the middle of next year or the end of next year,” he added.Aatrey’s comments come at a time when high-growth tech companies, which got listed on the bourses last year, including unicorns such as Paytm, Zomato, and PolicyBazaar, among others have been dumped by public market investors as these companies have never managed to show a company-level profit.Aatrey also said that the company is currently focusing aggressively on conserving cash. Meesho is confident of having a positive cash flow by early next year, and doesn’t have to pivot to save costs, he said. To be sure, Meesho had laid off about 150 employees earlier this year, in what the company called was a part of a ‘restructuring exercise.’ Aatrey also said that competition is lesser in the social commerce space.“If you look at last year, we raised close to a billion dollars. And we raised that so that we can be very aggressive in our business. Knowing what the environment is, we have scaled down our burn massively and we don’t need to spend as much as our competition,” said Aatrey.“Competition is much lesser, people are not spending much in marketing online, so competition is lesser.

Indian skincare startup Mamaearth eyes $3 billion valuation in 2023 IPO - sources,21 June,"Sequoia Capital-backed Indian skincare startup Mamaearth is in talks to raise at least $300 million in a planned IPO next year and is seeking a valuation of around $3 billion, three people with direct knowledge of the company's plans told ReutersFounded in 2016, Mamaearth has become popular in India with its range of ""toxin-free"" products such as face washes, shampoos and hair oils. It competes with Unilever's India unit, Hindustan Unilever, and Procter & Gamble Co in the booming personal care industry.The company was last valued at $1.2 billion in January this year when it raised fresh funds from investors including Sequoia and Belgium's Sofina.Mamaearth is targetting a valuation of around $3 billion – 10-12 times forward earnings based on sales growth and future revenue potential, a person briefed on the discussions said. It plans to file draft regulatory papers by the end of this year, said sources, who declined to be named as the plan is private.Two of those sources said Mamaearth is in early-stage discussions to raise at least $300 million in its IPO, with a third source pegging the number at $350 million.A Mamaearth spokesperson declined to comment on its IPO plans. The company's target valuation for the IPO, and the funds it plans to raise, have not been previously reported.The company is in talks with JP Morgan Chase, India's JM Financial and Kotak Mahindra Capital to appoint them as bookrunners to the deal, the sources addedJP Morgan Chase declined to comment. JM Financial and Kotak did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Mamaearth's IPO plans come during a broader rout in capital markets and a slowdown in India's booming startup ecosystem that recorded a steller $35 billion in record fundraising last year. Now, some startups are cutting back on staff and finding it difficult to raise funds, Reuters has reported.Mamaearth was co-founded by Varun Alagh, a former Hindustan Unilever executive, and his wife Ghazal. With the brand endorsed by popular Bollywood celebrities, the duo has cashed in on growing e-commerce adoption in India by offering its products on platforms such as Amazon and Walmart's Flipkart.India's beauty and personal care industry is expected to grow to $27.5 billion by 2025, from $17.8 billion in 2020, Indian financial services firm Avendus estimates. The number of online shoppers for beauty products is also projected to rise to 135 million from 25 million during that period, it added.One equity research analyst, however, said the success of Mamaearth's IPO could hinge on how it plans to rapidly expand into offline sales. Most Indians still go to retail outlets to shop, with e-commerce accounting for just 5-6% of spending.CEO Alagh told the Business Standard newspaper in January that 70% of Mamaearth's sales come from online platforms, but it was targetting a bigger offline presence and aiming to reach 40,000 retail outlets in 100 cities this year.For the fiscal year ended in March 2022, Mamaearth's parent, Honasa Consumer Pvt Ltd, registered a revenue of $130 million, with a small profit, said one of the three sources.The company recorded a post-tax profit of 246 million Indian rupees ($3.15 million) for the year ended March 2021.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/companies/indian-skincare-startup-mamaearth-eyes-3-billion-valuation-in-2023-ipo-sources-8717711.html,IPO,"It plans to file draft regulatory papers by the end of this year, said sources, who declined to be named as the plan is private.Two of those sources said Mamaearth is in early-stage discussions to raise at least $300 million in its IPO, with a third source pegging the number at $350 million.A Mamaearth spokesperson declined to comment on its IPO plans.Most Indians still go to retail outlets to shop, with e-commerce accounting for just 5-6% of spending.CEO Alagh told the Business Standard newspaper in January that 70% of Mamaearth's sales come from online platforms, but it was targetting a bigger offline presence and aiming to reach 40,000 retail outlets in 100 cities this year.For the fiscal year ended in March 2022, Mamaearth's parent, Honasa Consumer Pvt Ltd, registered a revenue of $130 million, with a small profit, said one of the three sources.The company recorded a post-tax profit of 246 million Indian rupees ($3.15 million) for the year ended March 2021.","['IPO', 'IPO', 'Business Standard', 'Mamaearth', 'Mamaearth', 'Honasa Consumer Pvt Ltd']","['at least $300 million', 'around $3 billion', '$1.2 billion', 'around $3 billion', 'at least $300 million', '$350 million', '$35 billion', '$27.5 billion', '$17.8 billion', '$130 million', '$3.15 million']"

Embedded value determination expected to be completed by June end: LIC Chairman MR Kumar,15 June,"The initial public offering of Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC) on May 17 came against the backdrop of a roughly 8 percent fall in benchmark equity indices in April and May. Rising inflation and the spectre of policy rate hikes had also triggered concerns over corporate profitability and dampened market sentiment.The stock tanked over 25 percent from the issue price. It hit a fresh record low of Rs 691.20 on the NSE and Rs 691.55 on the BSE in the intraday session on June 15.Speaking to CNBC-TV18 about the company's underperformance and the many worries raised by investors and analysts, LIC Chairman MR Kumar said that the stock market's downturn is causing fear, which is affecting the stock price.Talking about the delay in declaring its embedded value (EV) - an important metric that indicates an insurance company’s performance - for the September-March period, Kumar said the delay is due to LIC implementing a new IT solution for the calculation of EV, and that exercise of determining its embedded value as on March 31, 2022, is likely to be completed by the end of June.Kumar further said the insurance major is recording a robust growth compared with its private peers. Edited excerpts:LIC IPO has remained in the spotlight even many days after its listing. The reasons are different. The stock is down about 25 percent from its IPO price. The uncertainties have kept investors looking for answers. I want to talk about the stock and the business and how they correlate. The equity markets have been down. Your embedded value is closely linked to the performance of the equity markets. A lot of analysts are concerned. Are these concerns justified according to you?Not really (the concerns are not justified). I think the market down is itself a concern, and in the background of this, the stock has not done very well. I don't see why there should be concerns around its business, because LIC has been doing strong business in the last couple of months. We are going at the same rate as much as the private industry is. In some metrics, even more than what private businesses are doing. We have started an internal transformation. This will take some time. I am seeing the stock bucking up in the last couple of days. So, I think investors should remain patient and see the good signs that are about to come.The embedded value calculated as of September was 5.39 lakh crore. Since then, we don't have an update on how the EVs move. But, if we take the Nifty as a benchmark, it has corrected about 12 percent. Is it fair to assume that your embedded value would have also seen a similar sort of correction?We are still working out on the EV. So, I won't be able to comment on it. But I can say by the end of June, we will have our EV in place.The markets have seen some sort of correction. How much it will have an impact on the EV? Is it going to be higher than what was last reported? Or, investors could expect a lower EV for the transient phase of the market?Markets have corrected after March. The EV we are talking about is as of March 31. So people have to make assumptions as to how markets were as of March 31.EV calculations got delayed. Do you see such frequent delays in calculating EV? Or, do you expect them to be seamless?They (EV calculations) will be seamless. We had to model our EV based on the 250 products we have. So, it took some time for EV calculations in September. Now, we have all the infrastructure in place. Hope to report EVs along with the financials in the future.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/embedded-value-determination-expected-to-be-completed-by-june-end-lic-chairman-mr-kumar-8689651.html,IPO,"It hit a fresh record low of Rs 691.20 on the NSE and Rs 691.55 on the BSE in the intraday session on June 15.Speaking to CNBC-TV18 about the company's underperformance and the many worries raised by investors and analysts, LIC Chairman MR Kumar said that the stock market's downturn is causing fear, which is affecting the stock price.Talking about the delay in declaring its embedded value (EV) - an important metric that indicates an insurance company’s performance - for the September-March period, Kumar said the delay is due to LIC implementing a new IT solution for the calculation of EV, and that exercise of determining its embedded value as on March 31, 2022, is likely to be completed by the end of June.Kumar further said the insurance major is recording a robust growth compared with its private peers.I think the market down is itself a concern, and in the background of this, the stock has not done very well.","['NSE', 'BSE', 'CNBC', 'LIC', 'EV', 'LIC', 'EV']",[]

Exclusive-Beijing gives initial nod to revive Ant IPO after crackdown cools-sources,09 June,"China's central leadership has given billionaire Jack Ma's Ant Group a tentative green light to revive its initial public offering (IPO), two sources with knowledge of the matter said, in the clearest sign yet Beijing is easing its crackdown on the tech sector.Ant, an affiliate of Chinese e-commerce behemoth Alibaba Group Holding Ltd, aims to file a preliminary prospectus for the share offering in Shanghai and Hong Kong as early as next month, the sources said, declining to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter.The fintech giant will need to wait for guidance from the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) on the specific timing of the prospectus filing, said one of the sources.In a publicly released statement, Ant said there was no plan to relaunch its IPO, without elaborating. It did not respond to Reuters request for comment on whether it had received a green light from Beijing.The company's stock market listing was hastily shelved at the behest of Beijing in November 2020. At the time, it was slated to be valued at around $315 billion and planned to raise $37 billion, which would have been a world record.""Under the guidance of regulators, we are focused on steadily moving forward with our rectification work and do not have any plan to initiate an IPO,"" Ant said on its WeChat account late on Thursday.Neither the CSRC nor China's State Council Information Office, which handles media queries for central leaders, responded to Reuters' request for comment.Chinese authorities pulled the plug on the IPO and cracked down on Ma's business empire after he gave a speech in Shanghai in October 2020 accusing financial watchdogs of stifling innovation.The IPO's derailment marked the start of a regulatory crackdown to rein in China's huge homegrown technology sector, which spread to other industries, including property and private education, wiping billions off market capitalisations and triggering layoffs at some firms.With its economy slowing in a politically sensitive year when Xi Jinping is expected to secure an unprecedented third term as president, Beijing is looking to loosen it grip on private businesses including tech giants to help it meet a growth target of 5.5%, something economists have said will be hard to reach given COVID-19 lockdowns.""They are rolling back on their crackdown to counterbalance the lockdown they've had. Any data out of China lately has been dreadful because of lockdowns and the last thing they want to do is compound that issue. In the next three to six months we are likely to see China's crackdown unwound,"" said David Madden, market analyst at Equiti Capital in London.A revival of the IPO may also mark a rehabilitation of sorts for Ma, who has been maintaining a low public profile since Beijing swooped.Chinese Vice-Premier Liu He last month told tech executives the government supported the development of the sector and will back firms pursuing listings at home and abroad.In another sign of Beijing's softer stance, China's ride-hailer Didi Global, which has been under a cybersecurity probe since last year, is in advanced talks to buy a third of a state-backed electric-vehicle maker, Reuters reported on Wednesday.News of the talks comes after the Wall Street Journal reported on Monday that Chinese regulators are set to conclude their investigations into Didi, which could offer more hope to investors about its recovery.Bloomberg reported earlier on Thursday that Chinese financial regulators had started early stage talks on a potential revival of Ant's stock market debut, without mentioning a timeline.The regulator had established a team to reassess the share sale plans, Bloomberg reported.The CSRC later said in a statement it had not conducted any assessment or research work regarding an Ant IPO.The U.S. listed shares of Alibaba, which owns nearly one-third of Ant, were down 4% after earlier rising as much as 7% in pre-market trading on the Bloomberg report.U.S. private equity firm Warburg Pincus, a big investor in Ant's 2018 private fundraising, lowered its valuation of Ant to about $180 billion at end-March from $221 billion one year earlier, a separate source said.The regulatory clampdown meant Ant was restructured as a financial rather than tech firm and the financial sector typically carries lower valuations, sources and analysts said. Warburg Pincus declined to comment on Thursday.""The size of Ant and the IPO will have to be smaller than what was planned in 2020 because the market conditions have changed and cannot be compared to now,"" said Dickie Wong, executive director of Kingston Securities in Hong Kong.U.S.-listed shares of Chinese tech and e-commerce firms have gained this week on hints Beijing's one-and-a-half year long crackdown may be easing, with both ride-hailing firm Didi and Alibaba up by a third each.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/exclusive-beijing-gives-initial-nod-to-revive-ant-ipo-after-crackdown-cools-sources-8666551.html,IPO,"""Under the guidance of regulators, we are focused on steadily moving forward with our rectification work and do not have any plan to initiate an IPO,"" Ant said on its WeChat account late on Thursday.Neither the CSRC nor China's State Council Information Office, which handles media queries for central leaders, responded to Reuters' request for comment.Chinese authorities pulled the plug on the IPO and cracked down on Ma's business empire after he gave a speech in Shanghai in October 2020 accusing financial watchdogs of stifling innovation.The IPO's derailment marked the start of a regulatory crackdown to rein in China's huge homegrown technology sector, which spread to other industries, including property and private education, wiping billions off market capitalisations and triggering layoffs at some firms.With its economy slowing in a politically sensitive year when Xi Jinping is expected to secure an unprecedented third term as president, Beijing is looking to loosen it grip on private businesses including tech giants to help it meet a growth target of 5.5%, something economists have said will be hard to reach given COVID-19 lockdowns.In the next three to six months we are likely to see China's crackdown unwound,"" said David Madden, market analyst at Equiti Capital in London.A revival of the IPO may also mark a rehabilitation of sorts for Ma, who has been maintaining a low public profile since Beijing swooped.Chinese Vice-Premier Liu He last month told tech executives the government supported the development of the sector and will back firms pursuing listings at home and abroad.In another sign of Beijing's softer stance, China's ride-hailer Didi Global, which has been under a cybersecurity probe since last year, is in advanced talks to buy a third of a state-backed electric-vehicle maker, Reuters reported on Wednesday.News of the talks comes after the Wall Street Journal reported on Monday that Chinese regulators are set to conclude their investigations into Didi, which could offer more hope to investors about its recovery.Bloomberg reported earlier on Thursday that Chinese financial regulators had started early stage talks on a potential revival of Ant's stock market debut, without mentioning a timeline.The regulator had established a team to reassess the share sale plans, Bloomberg reported.The CSRC later said in a statement it had not conducted any assessment or research work regarding an Ant IPO.The U.S. listed shares of Alibaba, which owns nearly one-third of Ant, were down 4% after earlier rising as much as 7% in pre-market trading on the Bloomberg report.U.S.","['IPO', 'WeChat', 'State Council Information Office', 'Reuters', 'IPO', 'IPO', 'Equiti Capital', 'IPO', 'Reuters', 'the Wall Street Journal', 'Ant', 'Ant IPO.The']","['around $315 billion', '$37 billion', 'about $180 billion', '$221 billion']"

Delhivery CEO Sahil Barua navigates market meltdown in ‘nerve-wracking’ IPO,02 June,"Sahil Barua, chief executive officer of logistics startup Delhivery Ltd., minces no words about the process of going public in what’s shaping up to be an historic meltdown in the technology industry.“It was nerve-wracking,” said the 37-year-old, who is also a co-founder.The IPO last week came only after months of discussions with potential investors and investment bankers, Barua said. Executives paid multiple visits to would-be backers to explain the business models and numbers at the company, which is based in Gurgaon in the suburbs of New Delhi.Barua and his team slashed the size of the offering by about 30% at the beginning of May and then decided to price shares conservatively, essentially sacrificing some cash in the short-term to try to avoid a tumble for investors. Shares are now up 10% from Delhivery’s debut, which he thinks signals solid appetite for risk in India’s public markets despite a drop in financing from venture capital firms.“Technology stocks had corrected more than 20% in the period between filing our initial draft documents to our IPO so we modified our pricing,” Barua said. “We decided we’d rather have modestly-priced shares which rise rather than tumble on listing.”That the founders weren’t selling any shares in the company sent the right signal to the market, he said. Although retail investors bid for only about half the shares that were on sale, institutional investors flocked to the stock, resulting in an oversubscription.“Retail investors have a hard time understanding why new-age technology companies make losses,” he said.A rout in technology stocks is resetting expectations for the venture capital ecosystem, which has grown dependent on a flood of cash from privately held funds to finance money-losing operations. Delhivery -- which provides last-mile delivery, warehousing and cross-border logistics support to a variety of companies -- has been grabbing market share by spending its cash on buying smaller rivals. It’ll continue to chase acquisitions with the proceeds of the IPO, Barua said.Delhivery’s decision to stick to its IPO plans despite the market turmoil may stem in part from the need to replenish its reserves. Its cash hoard had shrunk to just over 3.6 billion rupees ($46 million) at the end of 2021 from more than 16 billion rupees at end-March 2019, while total expenses almost doubled in the nine months to December 2021 from a year earlier. Losses almost tripled over the same period.Delhivery’s backers include SoftBank Group Corp., Tiger Global LP, the Carlyle Group Inc. and FedEx Corp. Following a historic loss on its Vision Fund, SoftBank has said it plans to cut startup investment by 50% or more this year. The average monthly value of deals led by Tiger Global has also slowed to less than half what it was a year ago, according to PitchBook.Founded in 2011 as a food delivery service, Delhivery provides warehousing for Xiaomi Corp. and Lenovo Group Ltd., shipment tracking for Inditex SA’s Zara and Hennes & Mauritz AB, deliveries for Amazon.com Inc. and Walmart Inc.-owned Flipkart and logistics for India’s largest automakers, appliance manufacturers, and consumer goods makers. The company plans to expand overseas by partnering with minority shareholder FedEx Corp. to sell its technology services.Delhivery posted a fourth quarter loss of 1.2 billion rupees on revenue of 20.7 billion rupees earlier this week.Founders Barua, Kapil Bharati and Suraj Saharan spent years building their own maps, designing ways for freelance delivery staff to handle large amounts of cash, and expanding its reach beyond big cities in India’s fragmented logistics market spanning thousands of mom & pop logistics operators.While rising fuel prices and shortage of skilled labor are headwinds, companies like Delhivery are betting that scale will help them succeed.“Logistics is not a discretionary expenditure so there’s no softening of demand despite the Ukraine war and macro-economic shocks,” said Barua. “The intersection of logistics and infrastructure is at the heart of the India story.”",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/delhivery-ceo-sahil-barua-navigates-market-meltdown-in-nerve-wracking-ipo-8626071.html,IPO,"Executives paid multiple visits to would-be backers to explain the business models and numbers at the company, which is based in Gurgaon in the suburbs of New Delhi.Barua and his team slashed the size of the offering by about 30% at the beginning of May and then decided to price shares conservatively, essentially sacrificing some cash in the short-term to try to avoid a tumble for investors.The company plans to expand overseas by partnering with minority shareholder FedEx Corp. to sell its technology services.Delhivery posted a fourth quarter loss of 1.2 billion rupees on revenue of 20.7 billion rupees earlier this week.Founders Barua, Kapil Bharati and Suraj Saharan spent years building their own maps, designing ways for freelance delivery staff to handle large amounts of cash, and expanding its reach beyond big cities in India’s fragmented logistics market spanning thousands of mom & pop logistics operators.While rising fuel prices and shortage of skilled labor are headwinds, companies like Delhivery are betting that scale will help them succeed.“Logistics is not a discretionary expenditure so there’s no softening of demand despite the Ukraine war and macro-economic shocks,” said Barua.","['FedEx Corp.', 'mom & pop logistics']","['$46 million', 'more than 16 billion', '20.7 billion']"

Retail investors can hop and skip initial share sales,26 May,"The much awaited public listing of Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC) finally took place last week. The fanfare that marked the opening of the initial public offering (IPO), India’s biggest, was conspicuously missing at the time of listing.Retail investors, more prominently policyholders, had been gung ho about the prospects of stock in LIC, their most familiar personal finance companion.None of the optimism salvaged the day for LIC’s shares, which listed at a discount of around 9%; the price only trended lower for the day.The average investor hadn’t expected such a debut. LIC had revised its IPO pricing and almost halved its valuation in a period of two months. Many experts said this brought the valuation of the insurer to a reasonable level, leaving potential for listing gains.IPOs are heavily marketed to investors, both retail and institutional, but recent experience with new-age businesses shows that IPO pricing may not always leave room for long-term gains.It’s not just the pricing, but market sentiment also makes a difference. The euphoria around recent e-commerce IPOs has also shown that immediate listing gains do not necessarily mean the gains can be sustained.FY 2020-21 was the best year for IPOs in India; as many as 76 companies went public and raised over Rs 1.3 lakh crore, according to Prime Database. For the retail investor, the buzz was attractive because of the marketing rather than any substantial financial value to be derived from the IPOs. Here is why retail investors can safely avoid IPOs and save their time and energy for the secondary market after the stock lists.1. IPO pricing is a mysteryThe price of a stock going public is set in consultation with one or more investment banks. These investment banks work for the company that is listing and are paid by that company. Ideally, the offer price is based on the company’s valuation, arrived at by estimating the future financial prospects of the company. Whether this valuation is reasonable and an accurate representation of the future growth of the company is hard to judge for individual investors who are unaware of its future plans.“Usually I recommend that clients avoid IPOs as the secondary market is a much more efficient way for long-term investors to create wealth,” said Kavitha Menon, a Mumbai-based Certified Financial Planner,“The allotment in IPOs is uncertain and typically even if you get an allotment, the number of shares is very less. Plus, you could make money on some IPOs but there are others which are overpriced and on the whole, retail investors don’t end up making much this way.”How the final IPO price has been arrived at is not a process made public to investors, to whom it is a mystery. If you are unable to analyse the basis of IPO pricing, then why assume that it is accurate?2. External factors like grey market and market mood matterEven before the public issue is open for subscription, shares are available through private placement. Based on the over-the-counter price of these shares, there is a ‘grey market’ or active trade based on the listing prospects of a stock. Grey market prices are indicative, but they do show the direction of demand for subscription in the IPO. If demand is high, chances are that the grey market price trades at a premium and the listing takes place with a bang.Even so, the grey market can distract investors and the premium can well get eroded ahead of listing if market sentiment turns negative. This is the opposite of what happened in case of the listing of Zomato Inc, which listed at a 52% premium to its offer price. Unfortunately, in case of LIC’s listing, the grey market premium fell substantially and the listing was at a discount.Can retail investors track this sentiment effectively?“The market mood is very important; in a bull market, many people get carried away by greed to make quick gains,” said an Ahemdabad-based broker and mutual fund distributor. “Previously, it used to take months for a stock to list post the offer, but now it’s a matter of putting money in for just 15 days which is not a long time. If there is allotment and listing gains, then for an investor it is immediate gratification, which is what they are looking for.”Anup Bhaiya, founder of Mumbai-based Money Honey Financial Services, said: “Chasing momentum in stock markets is risky. Most individual investors come with speculative instincts, hoping for some quick gains on listing in a bull phase. But if the sentiment turns for worse, then the businesses with bad fundamentals or businesses asking for rich valuations tend to list below the IPO price and subsequently go down.”3. Information is limitedEven if you were to scour the IPO prospectus, information about the company is limited because most brokerages and analysts are yet to begin in-depth coverage of the company’s business. Most recommendations of buy or sell for the IPO itself are based on the information given in the prospectus rather than on ground research.Bhaiya said: “Promoters or existing investors who know everything about the business are offering their stock in the IPO. And a layman is trying to make money out of the IPO. The odds are clearly stacked against the retail investors in most cases.”Given that there is still a lot to learn about the company’s business, rushing in to subscribe to the public offer may work counter to your expectations. Moreover, a lot of the recent IPOs were just a vehicle for older investors to exit their positions rather than the company raising money for growth and expansion.“IPO pricing comes with very little value where it is about giving an exit to promoters and early-stage investors,” said Menon. “You have to be aware that money is not being raised to create new value in the business, then why pay a higher price? Companies do not have to be profitable before an IPO, but investing in a loss-making company with the expectation of unmatched execution capability is a big risk.”4. Secondary market investment“There is an opinion among retail investors that the primary market pricing is going to be the cheapest as it is first hand, but this is not the case,” said the Ahemedabad-based broker quoted above.Investors always have the option of waiting for the listing to happen and give it 6-9 month, by which time 2-3 quarters of earnings would have been published and analysts would have started deep coverage of the company. Investors will have more information not just about the financial health of the company, but also about how the management makes important decisions and its communication with shareholders.Experts say that insights come with time and are important in understanding the future value of the company on the basis of which you may want to invest for the long term.If you are investing in IPOs under peer pressure or in the fear of missing out, then you must also understand the risks involved and the fact that every IPO is not going to make you money. Moreover, after listing, the shares are freely available in the secondary market to buy and sell. Why not just wait for that?.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/personal-finance/retail-investors-can-hop-and-skip-initial-share-sales-8575571.html,IPO,"The fanfare that marked the opening of the initial public offering (IPO), India’s biggest, was conspicuously missing at the time of listing.Retail investors, more prominently policyholders, had been gung ho about the prospects of stock in LIC, their most familiar personal finance companion.None of the optimism salvaged the day for LIC’s shares, which listed at a discount of around 9%; the price only trended lower for the day.The average investor hadn’t expected such a debut.Investors will have more information not just about the financial health of the company, but also about how the management makes important decisions and its communication with shareholders.Experts say that insights come with time and are important in understanding the future value of the company on the basis of which you may want to invest for the long term.If you are investing in IPOs under peer pressure or in the fear of missing out, then you must also understand the risks involved and the fact that every IPO is not going to make you money.","['IPO', 'LIC', 'LIC', 'IPO']",[]

"OYO plans IPO after September, may settle for lower valuation",24 May,"Hospitality and travel-tech firm OYO is looking to launch its initial public offer after September and has written to stock market regulator Sebi, seeking to file updated and restated consolidated financial information.The company, which had filed preliminary papers with Sebi to raise Rs 8,430 crore through an initial share sale in October last year, is now prepared to settle for a lower valuation of around USD 7-8 billion against the USD 11 billion it was targeting initially, according to people in the know of the development.OYO's move to launch the IPO after the September quarter is mainly driven by the expectation of improvement in its financial performance and the current volatile nature of the market, they said.It is understood that in a letter to Sebi, Oravel Stays Ltd, which runs OYO, has sought permission to include restated financial statements for the six-month periods ending September 30, 2022, September 30, 2021, and September 30, 2020.""Price swings in a newly listed stock create concern among the public. Amongst such sentiments, it will be best to be able to first show to the investors that the business revival is real, it is strong and is leading to much higher bookings and perhaps, the first sign of a positive bottom line. Hence, OYO will likely wait for a quarter,"" said a person aware of the company's plans. When reached out for comments, OYO declined to comment. When reached out for comments, OYO declined to comment.As per the company's DRHP (draft red herring prospectus), OYO had incurred a Rs 1,744.7 crore loss in FY21. The company's proposed IPO comprised a fresh issue of equity shares aggregating up to Rs 7,000 crore and an offer for sale to the tune of Rs 1,430 crore, as per its DRHP.However, it has been reported that OYO now wants to go ahead only with the Rs 7,000 crore primary issue, doing away with the Rs 1,430 crore offer for sale (OFS) component, and has reached out to Sebi for approval.An OFS allows promoters of a company to sell their shares to the public through the stock exchange. OYO's OFS would have seen its largest investor Softbank Group selling around 2 per cent of its stake and other investors Grab Holdings, Huazhu Hotels and the family office of Sunil Munjal of the Hero Group diluting their stakes as well.Also, when OYO goes for listing in the markets, it will settle for a more reasonable valuation of around USD 7-8 billion, below the USD 11 billion it was targeting initially, considering how the stock markets have changed in the past few months, said a source. When the company filed its DRHP with Sebi in October 2021, the markets were buoyant and IPOs were getting high valuations and oversubscription with both global and domestic capital flowing into the stock market.However, the scenario has altered since then, with geopolitical unrest, rising inflation and interest rate hike cycle.

Why I gave the LIC IPO a miss,26 May,"Did you know that the more powerful and much faster tiger succeeds only in one out of every 10 deer hunts? In nine out of 10 times, the slower and much less powerful deer escapes. Why? The deer is running for its life whereas the tiger is only running for its dinner.The much-awaited and talked-about event in the Indian stock markets lived up to its billing. The LIC IPO broke all records for retail investor participation with the retail segment getting oversubscribed 2.95 times, and a record 7.3 million applications being received.The earlier record had stood for 14 years when the now much-maligned IPO of Reliance Power Ltd had received around 4.8 million applications.I consciously stayed away from investing in the LIC IPO as I have done for all the IPOs for over a decade now. The possibility of listing gains has never made me rethink on my approach. The reasons:IncentivesIn 1995, investment guru Charlie Munger gave a speech on ‘The psychology of human misjudgement’ at Harvard, where he listed 24 possible causes of human misjudgements. The first among these and the one that immediately shook me is the human tendency to under-estimate “the power of incentives” to shape our behaviour.Show me the incentive and I will show you the outcome - Charlie Munger.Munger in that speech gave two examples -- of FedEx and Xerox -- to drive home the point.In FedEx, the executives faced a curious problem of the night shift not turning over the dispatches fast enough from the warehouses. All attempts to speed up the shift failed until someone realised that the workers were paid by the hour.They immediately changed the payment to a shift basis from the hourly basis formula. Instantly, and as if on cue, the shifts got over a lot faster with workers vying to get home early. In simple words, if you are paid for an entire shift, the incentive is to finish the job early. But if a worker gets paid on an hourly basis, he tends to work for as many hours as he can, thereby leading to unnecessary delays.In the second example of Xerox, it was observed that a copier which was much inferior to Xerox was selling more pieces to the government. Upon analysing the problem, it was found that the incentives were structured in such a way that the salesmen received higher incentives to push inferior copiers over the better Xerox machines.For me this was a Eureka moment.I suddenly could see why people behave in a particular way. Whenever I must decide -- financial or otherwise -- I pause to reflect what is in it for the other party? I try to understand their incentives and objectives. Then decision-making becomes much easier.Let us now look at the recent LIC IPO through this lens of incentives.Incentives and IPOSo, what happens in an IPO?The promoters, who are privy to all information related to the company, floats an IPO at a time of their choice through the book-building process with the help of one or a team of top-notch Book Running Lead Managers (BRLM).The lead managers advice the promoters on the best time, issue size and issue price to help raise the maximum amount of money from the capital markets. Hence, it’s unlikely that the issue will be under-priced. The key parties involved in the IPO -- the promoters and the lead managers -- are incentivised to get the highest possible price and there are specific disincentives for getting a lower price.In the case of LIC of India, the promoter is the Government of India, which acts through a separate department specifically carved out under the Finance Ministry called Department of Investment and Public Asset Management (DIPAM) to keep a laser-like focus on the equity investments of the central government with one of the key responsibilities being to meet the disinvestment target of the central government.Lead managers are incentivised to set the highest possible issue price for subscription of the IPO, and the Finance Ministry and DIPAM are incentivised to meet the disinvestment target by getting maximum value as mentioned in their tender documents.I have not even spelt out the incentives of the other parties involved in the IPO transaction -- underwriters, stockbrokers, depository participants, banks, and other financial institutions. Their objectives include increase in revenue (commission, brokerage), market share and profits. None of them have investor wealth creation or helping investors find a bargain as their objective. On the contrary, many of them are incentivised to do the exact opposite.In such a scenario, for an individual investor it is more preferable and profitable to watch the IPO show from the sidelines, rather than actively participate in it. Yes, some listing gains may be lost, but it is always better to see the track record of the company for a few quarters or even a few years before parting with our hard-earned money.Not just LIC IPOSimply put, in our daily lives and investments, incentives matter a lot. It has great powers to distort human behaviour. Underestimating or ignoring the effects of incentives will lead to human misjudgement, which can be detrimental to our financial health.Look again now through this lens of incentives and some of you will agree with me on why I gave the LIC IPO a miss. When the next hot IPO hits town, hopefully at least some of you will remember this view.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/personal-finance/why-i-gave-the-lic-ipo-a-miss-8561511.html,IPO,"The first among these and the one that immediately shook me is the human tendency to under-estimate “the power of incentives” to shape our behaviour.Show me the incentive and I will show you the outcome - Charlie Munger.Munger in that speech gave two examples -- of FedEx and Xerox -- to drive home the point.In FedEx, the executives faced a curious problem of the night shift not turning over the dispatches fast enough from the warehouses.The key parties involved in the IPO -- the promoters and the lead managers -- are incentivised to get the highest possible price and there are specific disincentives for getting a lower price.In the case of LIC of India, the promoter is the Government of India, which acts through a separate department specifically carved out under the Finance Ministry called Department of Investment and Public Asset Management (DIPAM) to keep a laser-like focus on the equity investments of the central government with one of the key responsibilities being to meet the disinvestment target of the central government.Lead managers are incentivised to set the highest possible issue price for subscription of the IPO, and the Finance Ministry and DIPAM are incentivised to meet the disinvestment target by getting maximum value as mentioned in their tender documents.I have not even spelt out the incentives of the other parties involved in the IPO transaction -- underwriters, stockbrokers, depository participants, banks, and other financial institutions.","['Xerox', 'IPO', 'LIC', 'the Government of India', 'the Finance Ministry', 'Department of Investment and Public Asset Management', 'IPO', 'the Finance Ministry', 'DIPAM', 'IPO']",[]

Delhivery slides below IPO price in grey market ahead of Tuesday listing,20 May,"Shares of logistics and supply chain startup Delhivery have slid below the IPO price in the grey market ahead of listing on May 24.The stock was already seeing muted volumes in the grey market after the IPO saw a dull response from retail and high net worth investors. The stock hit peak premium of Rs 7-8 on May 1. The premium fell to Rs 3-4 on Wednesday. On Thursday, it turned minus Rs 3-6, a dealer said.The tepid response in the grey market was also due to continued losses reported by the firm with weak cash flows. Its IPO price band was set at Rs 462-487 a share.The company made a loss of Rs 891.14 crore for the nine months ended December 2021 and in FY21 it posted a Rs 416 crore loss. Revenue in the nine months ended December was Rs 4,911 crore; FY21 revenue was Rs 3,838 crore.In FY21, it reported a negative free cash flow of Rs 246 crore versus Rs 848 crore in FY20. At the same time, freight, handling and servicing cost has gone up from Rs 2,026 crore in FY21 to Rs 3,480 crore in the first nine months of FY22 (Rs 4,000 crore in FY22A).""The firm is demanding 5.5x price to sales. All other logistics players are making profits. Given fuel cost increases, supply chain and logistics issues, the costs for fulfilment will keep pinching them more.

GoFirst may launch IPO in July-September as sentiment improves over aviation stocks,19 May,"GoFirst, the budget airline previously known as GoAir, plans to launch its delayed initial public offering to raise Rs 3,600 crore in the second quarter of this financial year following a revival in market sentiment over aviation stocks.“Over 27 investors have shown positive interest. The company will make a fresh presentation soon,” a person aware of the airline’s plans said.Another person said GoFirst is optimistic about its IPO as domestic and overseas air travel opens up with no expectations of another Covid-19 wave.“Domestic air traffic rising to above the pre-Covid-19 levels, coupled with a recovery in the stocks of aviation companies, has once again increased the appetite of bankers,” another person said.Shares of InterGlobe Aviation, the operator of IndiGo, the country’s biggest airline, have jumped 8.1 percent over the past three days, while stocks of SpiceJet have rallied 7 percent in the same period.COVID-19 VaccineFrequently Asked QuestionsA vaccine works by mimicking a natural infection. A vaccine not only induces immune response to protect people from any future COVID-19 infection, but also helps quickly build herd immunity to put an end to the pandemic. Herd immunity occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population becomes immune to a disease, making the spread of disease from person to person unlikely. The good news is that SARS-CoV-2 virus has been fairly stable, which increases the viability of a vaccine.There are broadly four types of vaccine — one, a vaccine based on the whole virus (this could be either inactivated, or an attenuated [weakened] virus vaccine); two, a non-replicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of SARS-CoV; three, nucleic-acid vaccines that have genetic material like DNA and RNA of antigens like spike protein given to a person, helping  human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine; and four, protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombinant proteins of SARS-COV-2 along with an adjuvant (booster) is given as a vaccine.Vaccine development is a long, complex process. Unlike drugs that are given to people with a diseased, vaccines are given to healthy people and also vulnerable sections such as children, pregnant women and the elderly. So rigorous tests are compulsory. History says that the fastest time it took to develop a vaccine is five years, but it usually takes double or sometimes triple that time.India’s aviation sector has been recovering as people resume leisure and official travel after over two years of pandemic-related restrictions. However, the price of aviation fuel, the biggest cost component for airlines, has risen sharply, and competition is set to intensify as two additional carriers take to the skies.Like other airlines, GoFirst is betting on rising demand for leisure travel during the summer vacation to combat rising fuel prices, people aware of the matter said. The carrier expects the government to lift fare caps and include aviation turbine fuel in the goods and services tax regime to help the aviation sector.Jet fuelAviation turbine fuel prices have shot up almost 90 percent since May 2021. Jet fuel prices were increased by 5.3 percent on May 16 – for the 10th straight time – and now costs Rs 1,23,039.71 per kilolitre in New Delhi.GoFirst plans to use Rs 2,200 crore to be raised from the IPO to reduce debt and repay lessors. The remaining Rs 1,600 crore will be deployed to increase the airline’s operations in India and internationally, including adding flights to Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Sri Lanka, and Nepal.The airline expects domestic passenger traffic to surpass pre-Covid levels by 5-10 percent by the second quarter of 2022-23 in the absence of a new wave of Covid-19.The airline plans to convert its entire fleet of Airbus A320 Neos and Airbus A320 Ceos to Airbus A321 Neos. The airline currently has 52 A320 Neos and 6 A320 Ceos in its fleet. GoFirst plans to take deliveries of 10 aircraft per year until 2023-24 and another 72 aircraft will be delivered between 2023-24 and 2026-27.The airline had delayed its IPO plans in August 2021 after the Securities and Exchange Board of India called the promoters, the Wadias, for a pending inquiry. In December 2021, GoFirst further delayed the offering due to the outbreak of the Omicron wave and then the Russia-Ukraine war that started in February.Meanwhile, competition is set to intensify in the aviation sector as one new airline and another grounded carrier start flying later this year. Rakesh Jhunjhunwala-backed Akasa Air is set to start commercial operations in July, CNBC-TV18 reported on May 6. The airline expects to receive its first aircraft by early June. Jet Airways, under its new owners, may start flying this year.The IPO markets have slowed this year after record funds were raised in FY22. Indian companies sold shares worth $995 million in the January-March quarter of 2022 compared to $2.57 billion during Q1 of 2021, according to EY Global IPO Trends.

Aramco-style dividend is what LIC investors seek post flop debut,18 May,"Disappointed by a 7.8% plunge that made for the world’s second-worst trading debut among large IPOs this year, shareholders of state-run Life Insurance Corp. of India will be counting on a bumper dividend if Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government wants them to stay put.The 65-year-old insurer, a household name in the country known as LIC, raised $2.7 billion last week in the country’s biggest initial public offering. After pricing at 949 rupees ($12.2) apiece, the top end of a marketed range, the stock plunged as much as 9.4% to 860 rupees in opening minutes on Tuesday, before paring losses. It was about 1% in early trading on Wednesday.Some investors and analysts are concerned that the price could drop even more because of little growth prospects for the legacy business, risks of further disinvestment by the government and the absence of major incentives for shareholders.The stock is a “good portfolio hedge against volatility,” said Jayesh Bhanushali, assistant vice president for research at IIFL Securities Ltd., but the shares could face headwinds in the medium term if the government decides to dilute its stake in LIC further, he added. A “3%-4% regular dividend could be a sweetener that will make shareholders stay put,” he said.With the demand for a handsome payout, LIC investors are taking a leaf out of Aramco’s playbook, when the Saudi Arabian behemoth in the world’s biggest-ever IPO assured investors of a minimum dividend of $75 billion a year until at least 2024. That partly helped Aramco’s stock soar in its 2019 debut.While LIC has made no such promises in its offer documents, it isn’t clear if or how soon the company will bow to investors’ wishes.A finance ministry spokesperson declined to comment while a LIC representative was not immediately available for comment.LIC’s poor first-day performance came even as stocks in India and the broader Asian market rallied on Tuesday. The nation’s benchmark S&P BSE Sensex index jumped 2.5%, the most in three months.Should the stock fail to recover, its poor listing is set to disappoint millions of small investors who bid enthusiastically for the issue because of their long and emotional association with the insurer and its products. A household name in India, the firm has almost $500 billion in assets, 250 million policies and makes up almost two-thirds of the market. Policy holders were offered a discount of 60 rupees.“LIC’s dividend payout needs to be attractive to keep investors’ faith in the stock,” said Chokkalingam G, a strategist at Equinomics Research & Advisory Pvt. “The stock has plunged below the price it was allotted to retail investors and if it falls further, there has to be something that makes investors hold it.”The firm’s IPO plans faced headwinds right from the start, with assessors coming up with varying estimates for its valuation. It was considering raising as much as 500 billion rupees ($6.5 billion), people familiar with the matter have said. But the global slowdown in fundraising, the war in Ukraine and rising interest rates prompted the government to slash the target. Modi’s administration decided to push ahead with the IPO despite the volatility that sapped investor appetite for equities.“It’s more a case of bad timing than anything else,” said Brian Freitas, an Auckland-based analyst for independent research platform Smartkarma.‘Not Comfortable’Freitas said guaranteeing a dividend would’ve made it more attractive to some investors, but that would also require them to hold the shares for a period of time in this volatile market. “A lot of investors would not be comfortable,” he added.Local investors have often dubbed LIC’s offering as India’s “Aramco moment” in reference to the Gulf oil giant’s listing in 2019 that raised $29.4 billion. Some have called it the “IPO of the decade,” seen as critical to bolstering government finances and narrowing the budget deficit as spending and subsidies increased during the pandemic.At the listing ceremony in Mumbai on Tuesday, Tuhin Kanta Pandey, secretary at the divestment department in the finance ministry said LIC’s headquarters is “only five minutes from this place and of course it has taken 65 years to get listed.”LIC’s is the fourth-largest deal among global IPOs priced this year, coming when there’s a dearth of large-size offerings in financial hubs from New York to London and Hong Kong. There hasn’t been any listing exceeding $1 billion in Hong Kong or Europe so far this year.Some investors are looking to hold LIC shares over the long term as part of their wealth portfolio once the price stabilizes.“Dividends will help,” said Debkumar Bandyopadhyay, 57, who works as a consultant in Bangalore. “State-run companies are slow performers. My investment has also been led by the value that LIC offers and not so much growth.”The plunge on the first day of trading also prompted a few investors to step in and buy.“As Warren Buffett says, if everybody is selling go ahead and buy,” said Rajendra Agarwal, 54, who runs an investment firm and bought 200 LIC shares after the tumble. “We expect the stock will have more upside than downside.”",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/aramco-style-dividend-is-what-lic-investors-seek-post-flop-debut-8528621.html,IPO,"It was about 1% in early trading on Wednesday.Some investors and analysts are concerned that the price could drop even more because of little growth prospects for the legacy business, risks of further disinvestment by the government and the absence of major incentives for shareholders.The stock is a “good portfolio hedge against volatility,” said Jayesh Bhanushali, assistant vice president for research at IIFL Securities Ltd., but the shares could face headwinds in the medium term if the government decides to dilute its stake in LIC further, he added.Some have called it the “IPO of the decade,” seen as critical to bolstering government finances and narrowing the budget deficit as spending and subsidies increased during the pandemic.At the listing ceremony in Mumbai on Tuesday, Tuhin Kanta Pandey, secretary at the divestment department in the finance ministry said LIC’s headquarters is “only five minutes from this place and of course it has taken 65 years to get listed.”LIC’s is the fourth-largest deal among global IPOs priced this year, coming when there’s a dearth of large-size offerings in financial hubs from New York to London and Hong Kong.","['IIFL Securities Ltd.', 'LIC', 'LIC']","['$2.7 billion', '12.2', '$75 billion', 'almost $500 billion', 'as much as 500 billion rupees', '$6.5 billion', '$29.4 billion', '$1 billion']"
LIC | Will shares catch up with its true valuation?,18 May,"In first trades on listing, shares of the Life Insurance Corporation (LIC) of India traded at Rs 872 against issue price of Rs 949. At this price, all investors — including policy holders, employees, and retail investors who got shares at a discount of Rs 40-60 per share — lost money.It would appear that someone started buying large quantities of LIC shares thereafter. It reached a high of almost Rs 919 per share. In the first 20 minutes, 20 million LIC shares, about 10 percent of IPO, got traded.Despite a firm market the entire day, LIC remained subdued trading at a near fixed price of Rs 875 for most of the day, and closed at Rs 875.25.Soon we will know details of who sold and bought during the day. It looks quite likely that a good chunk of policy-holders, employees, and retail investors used this opportunity to exit.Was It Enough?LIC’s paid up equity capital is Rs 6,325 crore. The Government of India initially wanted to sell 5 percent of LIC’s equity (316.2 million shares) at about Rs 2,000-2,250 per share with a valuation of about Rs 15 lakh-crore.Tepid feedback from foreign investors, brokerages, and other advisers made it scale-down the LIC IPO to 3.5 percent of its equity (approximately 220 million shares) at a valuation of about Rs 6 lakh-crore to raise about Rs 20,500 crore.There was not much enthusiasm for LIC’s offering. The anchor book was barely subscribed with foreign investors largely staying away. The LIC issue was kept open for five days with banks accepting bids even over the weekend. Yet, the issue got oversubscribed just 2.95 times.LIC’s Embedded Value LIC’ balance sheet exceeds Rs 40 lakh-crore, higher than the AUM of all the mutual funds of about Rs 38 lakh-crore, with assets attributable to the shareholders exceeding Rs 15 crore.The value attributable to shareholders is fundamentally assessed by the metric of the earnings per share (EPS). However, in the case of life insurers such as LIC, another method of valuation — the embedded value — is also used. The embedded value, a complex method based on various assumptions about future, equals the present value of future profits together with market value of net assets.Actuaries assessed LIC’s embedded value at about Rs 5.4 lakh-crore. LIC’s embedded value was only Rs 90,000 crore in FY2020-21.No one really understands embedded value well. LIC’s DHRP discloses many risk factors associated with its embedded value, giving an impression that even the LIC management was not fully confident about its assessed embedded value.How to Value LIC Right?LIC’s DHRP disclosed its EPS averaged Rs 4.47 in three preceding years. Further, the EPS was only Rs 2.38 in the six months of FY 2022.The Price-to-Earning (PE) ratio, the most trusted conventional measurement of value, for LIC earning Rs 4.47 per share, works out to 212.3 per share for price of Rs 949. The PE ratio of other life-insurers range from 81.46 (for SBI Life) to 94.26 (for HDFC Life). Though their PE ratios are also high, LIC’s was simply a huge leap of faith. At a PE ratio of 90, LIC’s share price would have had to be only about Rs 400 per share.LIC earned a net profit of Rs 2,971 crore for its shareholders in 2020-21. In 2021-22, it earned Rs 1,672 crore of profits in first nine months. LIC is unlikely to report profits exceeding Rs 3,500 crore for the year 2021-22.A profit of Rs 3,500 crore amounts to an EPS of Rs 5.54 per share. Even if 100 percent profits are distributed to shareholders, they will get an investment yield of only about 58 paise per share — which is hugely disappointing for any investor. For giving investors a modest dividend yield of 2 percent, LIC share price should be about Rs 275 per share.Profits To Justify High ValuationCan LIC generate super profits for shareholders in the future to justify higher valuation?The DHRP informs that LIC generates much lower returns on its AUM. In FY21, LIC’s gross yield on life fund at 8.3 percent was the lowest among the first six life-insurers with others earning 8.6-9.9 percent. Net returns, which is not publicly disclosed, might not be exceeding 1-2 percent.SBI Life earns a net interest margin exceeding 3 percent, and is still valued at 15 times the EPS. LIC’s investment record and policies does not inspire confidence that it would be able to earn such investment returns.A much lower market valuation is assigned to PSU shares. Looked at from any time-tested valuation methods, LIC’s right share value does not seem to be exceeding Rs 450-500 per share.Share Price Catch Up LIC share price is likely to drift lower to catch up with its fundamental value. How long does it take will depend upon whether free market operates or some institution(s) keep propping up the price.Subhash Chandra Garg, currently Chief Policy Adviser, Subhanjali, is former Union Finance Secretary, and author of The $10 Trillion Dream.

Saudi Aramco weighs IPO of trading unit amid oil boom,17 May,"Saudi Aramco is considering an initial public offering of its trading arm amid a boom in oil prices in what could be one of the world’s biggest listings this year, according to people with knowledge of the matter.The state-controlled oil major is working with banks including Goldman Sachs Group Inc., JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Morgan Stanley as it studies a potential listing of Aramco Trading Co., the people said, asking not to be identified as the information isn’t public.The trading unit could fetch a valuation of tens of billions of dollars, the people said, with two of them saying it could be potentially worth more than $30 billion.Aramco, which recently became the world’s most valuable company, could sell a 30% stake in the division, two of the people said, which would make it one of the world’s biggest IPOs this year. South Korea’s LG Energy Solution raised about $10.8 billion in January.Other major oil producers have mostly kept their trading units under wraps, wary of revealing the secrets of a major source of profit. Aramco is still debating the merits of the potential listing, and there’s no certainty it will proceed, the people said.Details of the offering, including size and timing, could still change. Representatives for Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley declined to comment, while spokespeople for Aramco and Aramco Trading didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.Energy companies in the Middle East have been taking advantage of a surge in oil prices to list assets as their governments seek to reduce their reliance on oil and draw in foreign investors. Aramco is considering listing its refining company Luberef, Bloomberg News reported last month.Saudi Arabia also started preliminary discussions on a fresh Aramco stock offering that could raise more money than its landmark listing two years ago, people familiar with the matter said in February.Other Aramco subsidiaries that are already listed include chemicals maker Saudi Basic Industries Corp., and Rabigh Refining & Petrochemical Co. The United Arab Emirates’ national oil company has followed a similar pattern, listing its drilling unit and fertilizer maker last year.Aramco established the trading unit in 2011 and now trades everything from crude oil to LNG, according to its website. National oil companies in the world’s biggest crude-producing region have added trading arms in a bid to squeeze more revenue from each barrel and expand from simply exporting the raw commodity.The Middle East has emerged as a bright spot for IPOs as oil prices above $100 a barrel fill energy companies’ coffers, while increased weighting in regional indexes has led to significant equity inflows.

It listed at Rs 867.20 per share, an over 8.5 percent discount to its issue price, after the firm's initial public offering was oversubscribed nearly three times last week.The firm raised around Rs 21,000 crore and was valued at Rs 6.01 trillion at its upper price band of the issue of Rs 949 a share.At close of trade on May 17, the stock settled at Rs 872.70 on the BSE, down 8.04 percent from its issue price, taking its market capitalisation to Rs 5.52 trillion. After opening at Rs 867.20, the stock touched a high and low of Rs 920 and Rs 860.10, respectively.With the listing, policyholders and employees also saw their investments turn negative. LIC had offered a discount of Rs 60 to eligible policyholders and a rebate of Rs 45 to retail investors and employees, translating into an issue price of Rs 889 a share for policyholders and Rs 904 for retail investors and employees.Brokerage firm Macquarie has initiated coverage on LIC with a neutral rating and kept its target price at Rs 1,000 a share.Also read: LIC stock lists at over 9% discount; what should investors do?Corrections in the equity markets globally seem to have hit the listing for the biggest public issue in Indian capital market history.The situation was worsened by mounting inflationary pressure in India, stricter lockdowns imposed in China to combat Covid outbreak leading to fears of its economy taking a blow and having a knock-on effect on the world economy and global supply chains, and an unabated war on Ukraine by Russian forces that has led to a spike in commodity prices.While a lower valuation compared to peers is positive for LIC, accumulated losses of Rs 6,028 crore, falling market share, weak digital presence and the perception that not all decisions taken by the largest life insurer in the country are in sync with shareholder interests are worrying analysts.Also  read: LIC to focus on boosting policyholders’ returns, says chairmanAnalysts point out that shares of public sector undertakings that are listed on stock exchanges by way of disinvestments have a perception problem to begin with. That’s because these companies are seen as having an objective of social good over wealth creation, which creates a negative impression in the minds of investors and in turn affects the valuation matrix. Hence, it is no surprise that PSU IPOs have historically been lacklustre and have not turned into blockbusters.According to Bloomberg research, LIC will become the second-worst listing among 11 firms that listed globally and which raised over $1 billion this year. ASR Microelectronics Co Ltd in Shanghai, which raised a little over $1 billion, listed on January 14 at a nearly 34 percent discount.Despite the fall on the listing day, some analysts are positive on the stock, saying LIC is a typical blue-chip company that is expected to give steady returns over a long period of time and, therefore, returns over a day are not relevant. It is expected to remain quite attractive for investors, they hold.“Investors should not look to exit at current levels and hold the stock from a medium- to long-term perspective. We believe LIC continues to be a solid bet in the long run as it is a play on the growth story of the underpenetrated life insurance industry. Its sustained market leadership position, robust pan-India distribution network, and shifting focus towards profitable products, thus supporting margins and improving persistency ratios, will collectively make LIC an attractive pick from a long-term perspective” said B Gopkumar, MD and CEO, Axis Securities.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

Avoid to Ethos: Choice Equity Broking,17 May,"Choice Equity Broking IPO report on EthosEthos Ltd. (Ethos), a luxury & premium watch retailer is coming up with an IPO to raise Rs. 375cr, which opens on 18th May and closes on 20th May 2022. The price band is Rs. 836 - 878 per share. The company on 28th Mar. 2022, executed a pre-IPO placement of 0.03cr shares at Rs. 826 per share. Amount raised from pre-IPO placement was Rs. 25cr. Consequently, it reduced the size of fresh issue from Rs. 400cr (as mentioned in the DRHP) to Rs. 375cr. The IPO is a combination of fresh issue and OFS portion. It will not receive any proceeds from the OFS part. Of the fresh issue net proceeds (from the pre-IPO placement and the fresh issue), Rs. 235cr will be used to fund the working capital requirement; Rs. 33.3cr will be utilized to finance the establishment of new stores & renovation of existing stores; Rs. 29.9cr to be used for the repayment/pre-payment of the debt and another Rs. 2cr will be utilized for upgrading the ERP system of the company. In the last one year, Ethos has executed couple of ESOPs allotments (of 0.01cr shares at Rs. 120 per shares) and right issue (of 0.046cr shares at Rs. 550 per share), both at significant discount to the IPO price band.Valuation and OutlookThere are no listed peers having business model similar to Ethos. Despite having dominant position in the retailing of luxury & premium watches, the company performance over FY19-21 is not encouraging. Sales volume and profitability are in declining trend. Performance over the 9M FY22, doesn’t seems to be sustainable in the medium term.

The grey market premium of LIC is currently in the negative territory, trading at a discount of nearly Rs 30 a share.In the last 10 years, initial public offerings (IPOs) of big state-run firms have not created any blockbusters as such and mostly traded below their respective offer price.Analysts say public sector utility (PSU) stocks by definition are listed due to divestment, and their objective of social good over wealth creation impacts the perception of investors, and in turn valuation matrix. Hence, it does not come as a surprise that PSU IPOs have historically remained lacklustre and have not turned into blockbusters.India's biggest PSU IPO was Coal India, which was listed in November 2010 with an issue price of Rs 245 a share. It currently trades over 42 percent lower than its issue price. The firm raised over Rs 15,000 crore through the IPO.The second largest PSU IPO was General Insurance Corp which listed in October 2017. The firm raised over Rs 11,000 crore through the share sale. Currently, it trades nearly 73 percent lower than its issue price.New India Assurance and NHPC ranked third and fourth and both were listed in November 2017 and September 2009 respectively.

Funnycontrol | High PO : How to avoid getting high on IPO fever,14 May,"As Covid recedes from a pandemic to an endemic, a new fever has unfortunately crept up the spines of intelligent investors. It is called IPO fever. Now this is of course selling old capital in a new prospectus. Selling IPO gains as a guaranteed way of earning short-term profits is a trick as old as the hills. A lot like the credit-card salesman at the airport who tells you “free ticket leke baad mein card cancel kardena” (cancel the card once you've got your free ticket).The typical operating model is to tell you the potential listing gains vis-à-vis the IPO price. But ask any girl who married her college boyfriend because his band was “going to make it”. She could tell you a lot more about IPO bands than I could. The other IPO bands of course are the lead managers blood pressure and cholesterol levels.Now, traditionally there used to be a fixed IPO price. A lot like arranged marriage in terms of the incredibly narrow bands you were allowed to operate on. And there was immense pressure on you from book managers that all eligible IPOs have already been oversubscribed by the age of 21. At 30 and unmarried, frankly it’s a disgrace they haven’t taken away your merchant banking licence.Now we have the reverse book building process where both parties can transparently troll each other on social media and arrive at a mutually acceptable valuation. The only thing everyone seems to care about is that the IPO should be a success, never mind where the stock goes and tanks eventually. In some cases, you end up with permanent royalty payments in the form of alimony aka TDS for life.There has been commotion in the markets in recent times with some big-name IPOs, especially in the tech and startup space, trading at a significant discount from their IPO prices. But if you paid 2400X the sales for a stock just because you thought anything that sounds like tomato is a good investment, then you are exactly the kind of audience this column is looking for before it goes for IPO.A lot of tech and VC investments in recent times have also been looking at the IPO route as a means to exit their investments. A lot like how the East India Company beat a hasty retreat when its valuations started dipping.IPOs usually have a red herring prospectus telling you about all the potential red herrings. This is wasted on the same population that ignores all the red herrings in a dating app bio. If the profile says “not looking for hiccups”, you know this is an IPO you must not subscribe to, no matter how much the discount being offered.VCs also need to consider whether pushing companies to IPO for billion dollar exits is a sane strategy when many of them are still figuring out why their own drivers are trying to cancel them. A market analyst commented: “In the cost at which you are being offered a loss-making logistics IPO play, you could buy every listed stock in the space”.  But then I wouldn’t have bragging rights on Twitter, motivational quotes on LinkedIn and emotional atyachaar on Instagram.Regular readers of this column (who have been added to the mailing list for our red herring prospectus) would remember the previous article where we discussed the Laugh Insurance Corporation IPO. And how laughter is the best investment in volatile times. But you have to remember there is limited allocation for retail investors.  Because if you were a Qualified Institutional Buyer, you would not be taking financial advice from this column. If you are an employee, then you should know there is not much to choose between Aesop’s fables and ESOP tables. If you are the government hoping to reduce your misgovernance, then frankly we have seen way too many IPOs soar on listing day only to disappoint in the quarters ahead. And if you are a policy holder like me, then you have an incentive to keep on living so that your death does not affect the stock price.Now because I am also a poet (in case I didn’t mention it earlier), you could ask me “What is the IPO of life?” Well the answer, my dear Funnycontrollers, is lost in the regulatory winds as we have a new MD and CEO being hunted for the National Spiritual Exchange of India. Who has been host to many an IPO but somehow got a little too caught up in its own spiritual fever.Remember that in the IPO prospectus and road shows, every stock is sold like a blue chip. And every blue tick is sold like a stock. But when it comes to the fundamentals of investing, a good stock is like a good joke. Only those who get it, get it. So don’t lose your chance to get it before anyone else does.

Govt raises $2.7 billion as LIC prices IPO at Rs 949; listing next week,13 May,"India raised 205.6 billion rupees ($2.7 billion) as its biggest ever initial public offering priced at the top of the range following strong demand from local investors and a last-minute dash by foreign funds.Life Insurance Corporation of India shares have been priced at 949 rupees each, the state-run firm said in a prospectus filed Friday. LIC shares were offered at 902 rupees to 949 rupees apiece. Trading on the stock exchange is due to begin May 17.Dubbed India’s “Aramco moment” in reference to Gulf oil giant Saudi Arabian Oil Co.’s $29.4 billion listing in 2019 -- the world’s largest -- the float of LIC has ended up resembling the Aramco IPO not just in scale but in its reliance on domestic investors after some foreign buyers deemed it too expensive. Foreign institutional investors stepped up their bids for the sale in the last hours before the close of subscription this week, shunning currency risks and global market uncertainties.Besides smashing India’s record as the country’s biggest IPO, LIC’s offering is also the world’s fourth-biggest this year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. LIC’s debut comes at a time when capital-market activities have significantly slowed globally as the war in Ukraine stokes market volatility and saps investor appetite.Shares of LIC are trading at a discount of about 30 rupees to its IPO price in the so-called gray market, traders told Bloomberg News. The expectation for a strong debut by LIC’s shares is waning as the demand in the unregulated market, where investors bet on listing day gains, has come down over the last few days.Retail investors and LIC policyholders were among the most enthusiastic for the offering, thanks to the discounts they were offered. The portion reserved for them was fully taken up days before the offering was closed. The anchor portion of the IPO drew in sovereign funds from Norway and Singapore while other foreign investors picked up pace only on the last day.Overall, the LIC offer was oversubscribed by nearly three times. The money will help the government bridge a budget deficit that’s expected to widen as commodity prices soar across the world.For the banks working on the IPO, the share sale might not give them large fees but offers glory in the league table rankings, Bloomberg News has reported. The 10 banks on the IPO received a total 118 million rupees as fees, according to the prospectus, a fraction of what they could have typically pocketed for an offering of this size.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/ipo/govt-raises-2-7-billion-as-lic-prices-ipo-at-rs-949-listing-next-week-8501921.html,IPO,"The expectation for a strong debut by LIC’s shares is waning as the demand in the unregulated market, where investors bet on listing day gains, has come down over the last few days.Retail investors and LIC policyholders were among the most enthusiastic for the offering, thanks to the discounts they were offered.The money will help the government bridge a budget deficit that’s expected to widen as commodity prices soar across the world.For the banks working on the IPO, the share sale might not give them large fees but offers glory in the league table rankings, Bloomberg News has reported.","['LIC', 'LIC', 'IPO', 'Bloomberg News']","['205.6 billion rupees', '$2.7 billion', '$29.4 billion']"

IPOs: Sebi mulls option for pre-filing of offer documents,12 May,"Sebi on Wednesday proposed introducing an alternative mechanism for regulatory review by permitting ""pre-filing"" of offer document for companies contemplating initial public offerings.Under the proposal, an issuer should make ""pre-filing"" of offer document with Sebi and stock exchanges without making it available for public for an initial scrutiny period only, according to a consultation paper.The document should contain all disclosures as required currently under the ICDR (Issue of Capital and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations.

Should you buy LIC shares in the mega-IPO?,04 May,"On Wednesday, May 4, the initial public offering (IPO) of Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC), the largest share sale in the history of Indian stock markets, opens for subscription. Should you invest?Listing gains or wealth creation?First and foremost, decide why you wish to invest in LIC’s IPO. Do you want listing gains or build wealth over time?Put aside the urge to make listing gains for a moment. LIC is one of India’s most trusted brands. Trust is the most important factor in purchasing insurance, and it carries a lot more weight when it comes from a government company. So apply for the shares, use multiple accounts, and you'll be fine. This is subject to your risk profile and assessment.Be prepared to invest more after the listing. How much to invest in the shares after listing depends on a number of factors. LIC has its own set of strengths and weaknesses.LICs will sell shares worth Rs 20,557 crore in a price range of Rs 902-949. Existing policyholders will receive a discount of Rs 60 per share; retail investors and employees will get a discount of Rs 45 per share. To secure an allotment of shares, investors should apply for the stock at the higher price band. The discount provides investors a safety net.Understand what works and what may continue to work in LIC's favour.Attractive valuation in comparison to its peersThe revised LIC IPO looks appealing because it is available at an embedded value per share of 1.1 times, which is at a discount of nearly 65 percent compared to its peers in the private life insurance space such as HDFC Life Insurance, SBI Life Insurance or ICICI Prudential Life Insurance.In fact, HDFC Life is trading at a price to embedded value of 4-times, SBI Life at 3-times, and ICICI Prudential Life at around 2-times. As a result, LIC offers investor an excellent opportunity at a reasonable price.LIC, alone, is larger than the overall Indian mutual funds industry. As of September 30, 2021, LIC had total assets under management (AUM) of approximately Rs 39 lakh crore, which is greater than the AUM of the entire mutual fund industry. In fact, LIC invests the majority of its debt instruments in sovereign and AAA-rated securities, while more than 90 percent of its equity investments are in stocks that are part of the Nifty 200 and BSE 200 indices.Largest market share, but is it losing ground?Based on total premiums received in financial year 2021-2022, LIC has a market share of more than 60 percent. That makes LIC the market leader. But, it has consistently lost market share.Yet, even though it is losing market share, it still has the largest share of the life insurance market, even when compared to international insurance market leaders. To reclaim its lost market share, it must mitigate risks by providing more robust product offerings and utilising channels such as Bancassurance (remember that a majority of life insurance business for SBI, HDFC and ICICI comes from their bancassurance channels), among other things.Strong agent network has led to penetrationLIC also has the largest network of life insurance agents, accounting for more than half of all individual agents in India.India is largely under-insured country, although after the COVID-19 pandemic, people have started taking insurance more seriously. This creates an opportunity for the sector to grow. India has the highest protection gap among Asia-Pacific (APAC) countries, at more than 80 percent. Given our size and under-penetration, it presents a good opportunity to continue generating a minimum of 15 percent new business profit (NBP) for a long time.A large-cap stock waiting to enter indicesAfter its listing, LIC will be a part of the NIFTY and SENSEX indices and may continue to be one of India's top companies, making it a stock to hold in your portfolio. The percentage of allocation is determined by your risk assessment.There are a few concerns which you need to be careful about:Lower profit margins than competitorsThe majority of LIC's revenue comes from savings plans, which have a higher operating cost than selling protection plans. LIC's VNB margin, or Value of New Business margin, is around 10 percent, which is very low when compared to SBI Life's 21 percent, HDFC Life's 26 percent, and ICICI Prudential Life's 27 percent.LIC has a lot of ground to make up here.Also, LIC must step up its game by utilising digital platforms and creating a robust digital experience similar to that offered by its competitors.The bailout kingThe government controls LIC, and in the past, LIC has bailed out many companies that were in trouble. Even the LIC's share sale prospectus states that it may be required to take certain actions with no guarantee that such actions will be beneficial. We can only hope that this changes after its listing.Stock price rise can be slow if supply is consistentThere is concern that LIC will continue to come out with offers for sale to raise more money, which may work against the stock price, as opposed to that of a company like Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS), which, rather than issuing more stock, ends up buying back its own. But, as long as you're invested in a solid company like LIC, you shouldn't be too concerned about supply; if there's a correction, you can always add more.Should you invest?Follow the 50-25-25 rule before you invest in LIC or any other stocks. You can follow my rule, which states that you should invest 50 percent of your equity allocation in top and emerging sectors such as banking and finance, auto, information technology, insurance, and so on, and invest in the top 2 or 3 companies from these sectors. The remaining 25 percent can be invested in any good mid-cap company, which means any company that is not in the top 100 by market capitalisation and is between the top 101 and 250 in India. The remaining 25 percent can be invested as you see fit, which means you can do whatever you want with it as long as you don't break the rules.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/personal-finance/should-you-buy-lic-shares-in-the-mega-ipo-8447381.html,IPO,"The discount provides investors a safety net.Understand what works and what may continue to work in LIC's favour.Attractive valuation in comparison to its peersThe revised LIC IPO looks appealing because it is available at an embedded value per share of 1.1 times, which is at a discount of nearly 65 percent compared to its peers in the private life insurance space such as HDFC Life Insurance, SBI Life Insurance or ICICI Prudential Life Insurance.In fact, HDFC Life is trading at a price to embedded value of 4-times, SBI Life at 3-times, and ICICI Prudential Life at around 2-times.LIC's VNB margin, or Value of New Business margin, is around 10 percent, which is very low when compared to SBI Life's 21 percent, HDFC Life's 26 percent, and ICICI Prudential Life's 27 percent.LIC has a lot of ground to make up here.Also, LIC must step up its game by utilising digital platforms and creating a robust digital experience similar to that offered by its competitors.The bailout kingThe government controls LIC, and in the past, LIC has bailed out many companies that were in trouble.","['LIC', 'IPO', 'HDFC Life Insurance', 'SBI Life Insurance', 'ICICI Prudential Life Insurance', 'HDFC Life', 'ICICI Prudential Life', 'LIC', 'VNB', 'Value of New Business', ""SBI Life's"", ""HDFC Life's"", ""ICICI Prudential Life's"", 'LIC', 'LIC', 'LIC']",[]

Here is what they have to say.'Fairly-valued IPO, but needs digital distribution'The LIC IPO has found takers among institutional investors due to valuation of the IPO, resizing of the issue and LCI's intent to become more digital-oriented, according to fund managers.“Initially, there was talk about two-times embedded value. Now, the IPO is getting priced at 1.1-times its embedded value. So, it is fairly priced. The share float has also been reduced to Rs 21,000 crore, with government selling 3.5 percent stake instead of 5 percent. Markets should be able to handle this kind of supply even in current global environment,” said a fund manager, whose schemes have participated in the anchor book.“But, at the same time, we don’t expect much accretion to the value, which comes from incremental business or growth. LIC’s stock will have a lot of linkage with the markets as well. Its embedded value is dependent on how the equity market behaves. There is lot of portion that is mark-to-market. Overall, the company has much higher investments in equity,” he added.Not all mutual funds think that LIC's growth will be a major problem for the stock.Also read: These mutual funds didn't participate in LIC anchor book“LIC is a dominant player in an emerging market. So, it will have a reasonable growth, even though it might not be as much as its private insurance counterparts. There is still under-penetration of insurance products in India.

Ahead of LIC IPO a look at some worrying spots,30 April,"Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC) will open its public issue for subscription next week with most analysts giving a ‘Subscribe’ rating to the issue, thanks to cheaper valuation compared to listed insurers. Anand Rathi, Religare Broking, Marwadi Financial Services and Samco Securities have given ‘Subscribe’ ratings.However, some analysts are also cautioning investors against the pitfalls of investing in the country's largest life insurer.LIC has been consistently losing market share to private peers. Currently, LIC holds 64 percent market share in terms of total life insurance premium. It grew at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 9 percent during FY16-21, while private insurers grew at 18 percent.LIC has admitted that at times its actions at the behest of the government could be contrary to shareholders’ interest. Previously, LIC has bailed out the initial public offerings (IPOs) of Bharat Dynamics Ltd and Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd in 2018. The firm also bought IDBI Bank, which was reporting losses continuously due to a surge in bad loans. LIC had infused Rs 21,600 crore for 51 percent stake in IDBI Bank. In 2019, another Rs 4,743 crore was infused in the bank.Another concern is that LIC doesn’t have a strong digital presence and 90 percent of its policies are sold by agents. The company’s draft papers showed that just 36 percent of individual renewal premiums were collected digitally, compared to over 90 percent for private players. Analysts said that if this trend continues, then total cost is likely to increase for LIC, going forward.Investing in digital collection systems is a one-time cost, whereas physically investing in branches and resources to collect actual cash will be more expensive. Analysts are worried that persistently weak digital presence could keep costs high as agents typically receive high commissions.Yet another worry is that LIC’s value of value of new business margin (VNB) as of September 2021 stood at 9.3 percent, whereas for the full FY21, it was 9.9 percent. However, other listed players like SBI Life, HDFC Life, ICICI Prudential Life, Max Life and Bajaj Allianz Life reported VNB margins of 11-27 percent. The VNB margin for all the players improved substantially during 2016 to 2021. Among the players in this set, HDFC Life reported the highest VNB margin of 26.1 percent in FY21, followed by Max Life with 25.2 percent.LIC is also sitting on a mark-to-market (MTM) loss of Rs 6,028 crore. LIC said in its draft papers that of the Rs 11,265 crore worth of debt papers of mispriced insurance policies, papers worth Rs 5,351 crore are non-performing assets (NPAs) for which full provisioning has been done at an amortised cost, and if this transaction is shown in the balance sheet, LIC would have to show a loss of Rs 6,028 crore. Analysts are now watching how LIC will adjust this MTM loss in its balance sheet.Aditya Kondawar, Chief Investment Officer at JST Investments said that despite the valuation being 1.1x price-to-embedded value, he would wait and watch on this IPO. LIC’s peers HDFC Life and SBI Life are trading at P/EV of 4.0x and 3.0x respectively.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/ipo/ahead-of-lic-ipo-a-look-at-some-worrying-spots-8432871.html,IPO,"Among the players in this set, HDFC Life reported the highest VNB margin of 26.1 percent in FY21, followed by Max Life with 25.2 percent.LIC is also sitting on a mark-to-market (MTM) loss of Rs 6,028 crore.LIC said in its draft papers that of the Rs 11,265 crore worth of debt papers of mispriced insurance policies, papers worth Rs 5,351 crore are non-performing assets (NPAs) for which full provisioning has been done at an amortised cost, and if this transaction is shown in the balance sheet, LIC would have to show a loss of Rs 6,028 crore.","['HDFC Life', 'LIC', 'MTM', 'LIC', 'LIC']",[]

Three points on which LIC IPO needs to be evaluated,29 April,"The government is making an offer for sale (OFS) for 3.5 percent stake in the Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC). At Rs 902, the lower point of the price band fixed for OFS, the LIC will be valued at Rs 5.7 trillion. At this valuation it will be the fifth-largest publicly-listed Indian entity.The OFS will yield Rs 199.7 billion to the government, about 30.6 percent of the total disinvestment target of Rs 650 billion fixed for FY23. The government has apparently cut the offer size from 5 percent announced in February to 3.5 percent, considering the jittery market conditions. We shall therefore see multiple follow-on offers from the government in the coming years.Ten percent of the shares offered for sale are reserved for LIC policyholders; and 0.7 percent shares are reserved for LIC employees; 31.25 percent of the offer is reserved for household (retail) investors. Applicants from these categories will get a discount of Rs 45 (Rs 60 for policyholders) on the actual offer price. For all these categories the maximum application is restricted to Rs 2 lakh; implying 230-odd shares at lower price band after discount.LIC is an important national institution. In fact, till 2000, it was the only life insurer in India. Even after 22 years of the entry of private players in the business, LIC enjoys over 60 percent market share in the life insurance business. On the basis of gross premium underwritten, LIC is the fifth-largest life insurer in the world. Over 1.3 million individuals work as LIC agents, making it one of the largest employment providers in the country. LIC manages over Rs 40 trillion in financial assets, which is more than the combined AUM of the entire asset management industry of India. LIC owns (on the behalf of its stakeholders) about 4 percent of NSE market capitalisation. Besides SBI, LIC is perhaps the only truly pan India financial services brand. LIC is used as a generic term for life insurance in India. No surprise that LIC has been widely recognised as one of the most-trusted Indian brands.Considering the magnitude of the proposition, the decision to invest in LIC looks pretty simple, and straightforward. Numerous reports have been published highlighting the large size, financial details, relatively cheaper valuations, and growth prospects of the LIC. However, the LIC OFS needs to be evaluated from the following three viewpoints:LIC is a statutory corporation established under the Life Insurance Corporation Act, 1956. Besides the nationalised banks, it will be the first non-company to be listed on the Indian stock exchanges. The financial market regulators RBI and SEBI have limited jurisdiction over LIC. It is also outside the purview of the registrar of companies and NCLT. The affairs of LIC may not be as transparent as other financial services companies. Besides, the accounting methods followed by LIC may or may not be fully compliant with the generally accepted accounting principles (GAAPs).Like all other public sector enterprises, LIC may also be subject to government intervention in routine affairs like appointment of key managerial personnel, investments, introduction and/or withdrawal of products, pricing of products, etc.Since 2000, when the private insurers were first allowed in India, LIC has been consistently losing market share. With the popularity of digital sales channels and expansion of bank branch networks of SBI, HDFC, ICICI, it is likely that this trend may continue for many more years.I would therefore recount my experiences of investment in Coal India (coal mining monopoly), ONGC (oil and gas exploration and production monopoly) and NTPC (power generation monopoly) at the time of listing; and also UTI (asset management monopoly) which went bankrupt due to government invention in its investment process and pricing of products.I shall not get influenced by the ‘cheaper valuation offered’ argument, because LIC deserves to be valued cheaply than professionally-managed, well-regulated, and transparent insurers; just like public sector enterprises (including banks).I will not regret if LIC gets listed at a significant premium to the OFS price, since many institutional investors will be compelled to include it in their portfolios due to sheer size of the corporation, and likelihood of inclusion in benchmark indices.Vijay Kumar Gaba is Director, Equal India Foundation.Views are personal and do not represent the stand of this publication.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/opinion/three-points-on-which-lic-ipo-needs-to-be-evaluated-8429571.html,IPO,"We shall therefore see multiple follow-on offers from the government in the coming years.Ten percent of the shares offered for sale are reserved for LIC policyholders; and 0.7 percent shares are reserved for LIC employees; 31.25 percent of the offer is reserved for household (retail) investors.With the popularity of digital sales channels and expansion of bank branch networks of SBI, HDFC, ICICI, it is likely that this trend may continue for many more years.I would therefore recount my experiences of investment in Coal India (coal mining monopoly), ONGC (oil and gas exploration and production monopoly) and NTPC (power generation monopoly) at the time of listing; and also UTI (asset management monopoly) which went bankrupt due to government invention in its investment process and pricing of products.I shall not get influenced by the ‘cheaper valuation offered’ argument, because LIC deserves to be valued cheaply than professionally-managed, well-regulated, and transparent insurers; just like public sector enterprises (including banks).I will not regret if LIC gets listed at a significant premium to the OFS price, since many institutional investors will be compelled to include it in their portfolios due to sheer size of the corporation, and likelihood of inclusion in benchmark indices.Vijay Kumar Gaba is Director, Equal India Foundation.Views are personal and do not represent the stand of this publication.","['LIC', 'LIC', 'HDFC', 'ICICI', 'ONGC', 'NTPC', 'UTI', 'LIC', 'LIC', 'OFS', 'Equal India Foundation']",[]
Market volatility may deter companies from launching IPOs after LIC share sale ends,29 April,"India’s stock markets are unlikely to face a flurry of initial public offerings after the Life Insurance Corporation of India share sale ends because volatility will keep most companies on the side-lines, analysts said.The LIC share sale on May 4-9 is expected to fetch the government Rs 21,000 crore, making it the country’s largest IPO. It will follow IPOS from Campus Activewear and Rainbow Children’s Medicare, which concluded this week.“The IPO line-up is bulky and strong, but there’s a wait-and-watch strategy by the issuers due to market conditions being dicey and the pending public offer of financial behemoth LIC,” said Manan Doshi, cofounder of UnlistedArena.com.India’s stock markets are under pressure due to the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict. Surging inflation globally, policy tightening by central banks, and continued selling of shares by foreign investors also worried investors. The key BSE Sensex and Nifty 50 indices have declined 1.8 percent each so far in April and 1.2 percent each this year.Once the LIC IPO concludes and equity market conditions improve, Delhivery, an Indian logistics and supply chain startup, and API Holdings, the parent company of online pharmacy PharmEasy, are likely to launch their share sales, said a banker who did not want to be identified.However, investors will remain cautious on IPO pricing and valuations after seeing many wealth destroyers. Paytm owner One97 Communications, CarTrade and Fino Payments Bank have declined 20-70 percent from their issue price. New-age listed firms Zomato and FSN E-Commerce Ventures are down over 50 percent from their recent highs.Cautious investors“In the ongoing IPOs, investor interest is not uniform. Investor interest will depend on two things – how much the QIB (qualified institutional buyer) portion is oversubscribed and the trend in the grey market premium,” said Deepak Jasani, head of retail research at HDFC Securities.After IPOs worth a record Rs 1.18 lakh crore in 2021, only six companies launched initial share sales this year, raising around Rs 8500 crore. These are Adani Wilmar, Vedant Fashions, AGS Transact Technologies, Veranda Learning Solutions, Campus Activewear and Rainbow Children’s Medicare.According to analysts, over 54 companies have approval from the Securities and Exchange Board of India to raise about Rs 75,000 crore. Another 50 companies planning IPOs for about Rs 80,000 crore are awaiting the regulator’s approvals.Doshi said companies preparing to sell shares will likely price them reasonably and keep value on the table for investors.According to analysts, the LIC IPO will get a good response from retail and institutional investors. There has been a rise in the number of accounts opened to hold shares in dematerialised (demat) or digital form, a requisite for investing in the stock market.“A recent sharp rise in retail participation in the country’s stock markets can be gauged from the 289 lakh new demat accounts opened from April 2021 to January 2022 and the IPO offers a fresh chance to deepen the equity markets further,” said Mohit Nigam, head - PMS, at Hem Securities. “The insurance giant’s huge policyholder base has the potential to bring a large number of new investors, who have historically relied on traditional saving products, to the capital market.”",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/ipo/market-volatility-may-deter-companies-from-launching-ipos-after-lic-share-sale-ends-8428301.html,IPO,"The key BSE Sensex and Nifty 50 indices have declined 1.8 percent each so far in April and 1.2 percent each this year.Once the LIC IPO concludes and equity market conditions improve, Delhivery, an Indian logistics and supply chain startup, and API Holdings, the parent company of online pharmacy PharmEasy, are likely to launch their share sales, said a banker who did not want to be identified.However, investors will remain cautious on IPO pricing and valuations after seeing many wealth destroyers.There has been a rise in the number of accounts opened to hold shares in dematerialised (demat) or digital form, a requisite for investing in the stock market.“A recent sharp rise in retail participation in the country’s stock markets can be gauged from the 289 lakh new demat accounts opened from April 2021 to January 2022 and the IPO offers a fresh chance to deepen the equity markets further,” said Mohit Nigam, head - PMS, at Hem Securities.","['IPO', 'API Holdings', 'PharmEasy', 'IPO', 'IPO', 'PMS', 'Hem Securities']",[]
"Left opposes LIC IPO, alleges 'scam', 'sell off'",29 April,"Left parties on Thursday attacked the government over its move to float the LIC IPO alleging that it was a “scam” and a “sell-off”.The CPI in a statement said it was a part of the “privatisation spree” of the government.Communist Party of India (CPI) general secretary D Raja said it was a “matter of regret” that the BJP-led NDA government is selling off all national assets through monetisation policy and privatisation of public sector units.He said it was a “tragedy” that those long-term assets are being sold to collect revenue to meet the current expenditure.Raja said the move was also the failure of the government to secure enough finances through either retaining the earlier higher corporate taxes or hiking them further, if necessary, to offset the heavy losses caused by “rightist US-model economic policies”.The “sell-offs” are bound to affect the sovereignty and economic independence of country which in contrast will benefit the corporates, both domestic and foreign, he said.“Continuing with retrograde right-wing measures, the Modi government has announced that its share capital in the country’s flagship financial institution, LIC will be sold off. With such sale, 22 crore of LIC’s shares are being given in private hands which will fetch about Rs 20,000 crore of revenue to the central government.“The move is totally a retrograde one, which is against the national interests and against the interest of LIC’s policy holders. The Party calls upon the government to immediately halt its privatisation spree as well as sell-off of its national assets,” Raja said.CPI-Marxist general secretary Sitaram Yechury called the move a “Scam of gigantic proportions”, and a “mega plunder of people’s resources”.“LIC has been the biggest contributor funding the development of India’s infrastructure.

Nomura expects Indian IPO market to pick up in second half,25 April,"Nomura Holdings Ltd. expects initial public offerings in India will regain momentum in the second half of this year as indicated by increasing activity in secondary share sales.“The capital markets on the secondary side which is on the block and QIPs have started to pick up,” Amit Thawani, head of India coverage investment banking at Nomura, said in an interview with Bloomberg Television on Tuesday. “We expect a constructive environment especially in the second half of the year for IPOs.”Global IPO activity has slowed down recently as the Russian invasion of Ukraine and rising interest rates spurred market volatility. Companies have raised around $1.1 billion through first-time share sales in India so far this year, down from $2.6 billion from the same period in 2021, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.India’s capital market fundraising will remain robust in the next six to 12 months as companies such as state-owned Life Insurance Corp. and some technology companies are still looking to list in Mumbai, Thawani said. Most of the firms will seek domestic listings instead of going overseas, he added.Private equity funds will continue to boost mergers and acquisitions volume in India and conglomerates consolidating their domestic businesses is also a driving factor, Thawani said.HDFC Bank Ltd., India’s most valuable bank, this month agreed to take over the country’s largest mortgage lender Housing Development Finance Corp. in a deal valued at about $60 billion. The merger does create a benchmark for some of the larger financial institutions to think about what their game plan should be for the coming years, Thawani said, adding there could be more consolidation in the sector.Nomura expects fair amount of activities related to the environmental, social and governance theme in India.“I would say in the next 12 months you should expect maybe one or two capital market listings from the renewable sector,” Thawani said.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/ipo/nomura-expects-indian-ipo-market-to-pick-up-in-second-half-8406561.html,IPO,"Nomura Holdings Ltd. expects initial public offerings in India will regain momentum in the second half of this year as indicated by increasing activity in secondary share sales.“The capital markets on the secondary side which is on the block and QIPs have started to pick up,” Amit Thawani, head of India coverage investment banking at Nomura, said in an interview with Bloomberg Television on Tuesday.The merger does create a benchmark for some of the larger financial institutions to think about what their game plan should be for the coming years, Thawani said, adding there could be more consolidation in the sector.Nomura expects fair amount of activities related to the environmental, social and governance theme in India.“I would say in the next 12 months you should expect maybe one or two capital market listings from the renewable sector,” Thawani said.","['Nomura Holdings Ltd.', 'Amit Thawani', 'Nomura', 'Bloomberg Television', 'Nomura']","['around $1.1 billion', '$2.6 billion', 'about $60 billion']"
Waning demand for LIC IPO highlights fiscal challenges for Modi,25 April,"India’s decision to go ahead with a much-reduced target for its vaunted life insurer’s initial public offering, as skittish investors continue to pull money from the South Asian nation, is adding to the risks threatening the nation’s fiscal deficit target.Life Insurance Corporation of India’s board on Saturday approved selling a 3.5% stake for about 210 billion rupees ($2.8 billion), far lower than the 500 billion rupees estimated before Russia invaded Ukraine. Anchor investors had been reluctant to commit as the war eroded demand for equities, according to people with knowledge of the matter, with foreign funds withdrawing more than $16 billion from Indian stocks this year.Prime Minister Narendra Modi needs inflows because crude oil prices -- one of India’s largest imports -- have surged. Costs have risen so much that it’s becoming unsustainable for the administration to keep charging taxes on fuel that have been key to bridging a budget deficit. Leaving pump prices high risks stoking inflation and potential social unrest that is already roiling neighboring nations as the region emerges from the pandemic.“I am absolutely grateful to the people of India,” Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said in an interview in Washington last week, while outlining some of her government’s welfare programs. “Unless the people are going to stand up and say ‘right, we have to survive this,’ it’s not going to be easy.”State-run LIC is seeking a 6 trillion rupee valuation and could open the offer in the first week of May, officials told reporters, asking not to be identified, citing rules on speaking with the media. Details such as issue price and dates will be known around Wednesday, pending regulatory clearances, they added.Missing TargetsThe finance ministry had missed Modi’s huge asset-sale target of 1.75 trillion rupees for the previous financial year by a wide margin after monetization plans, including LIC’s listing, got delayed. The goal is 650 billion rupees for the current year, which will feed into containing the overall budget deficit at 6.4% of gross domestic product.“It will be difficult for the government to meet its deficit targets given that the IPO size is now much smaller,” said Kranthi Bathini, a strategist at Mumbai-based WealthMills Securities Pvt. “The war in Ukraine has completely changed the mood of foreign investors who are now skittish to invest. LIC IPO has already been delayed, first due to Covid, then this war. It’s difficult for the government to delay it further.”The government’s main challenge is that while it has pared down the size of LIC IPO, the sale will still be India’s biggest, surpassing the listing of One 97 Communications Ltd., which raised about 183 billion rupees in November. Finding buyers for such a large offering could be a challenge in the current economic environment.India’s benchmark index, one of the world’s best performers last year, has lost 1.8% in 2022. The nation’s inflation rate has breached the central bank’s tolerance band for three straight months, and swap markets are pricing in the most aggressive monetary tightening among major central banks in the region. The rupee is approaching a fresh record low too.However, the finance minister remains confident about completing the sale. The markets in India are maintaining a “positive spirit,” and LIC share sale should go through comfortably, Sitharaman had said last week, before the board’s clearance.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/waning-demand-for-lic-ipo-highlights-fiscal-challenges-for-modi-8406521.html,IPO,"India’s decision to go ahead with a much-reduced target for its vaunted life insurer’s initial public offering, as skittish investors continue to pull money from the South Asian nation, is adding to the risks threatening the nation’s fiscal deficit target.Life Insurance Corporation of India’s board on Saturday approved selling a 3.5% stake for about 210 billion rupees ($2.8 billion), far lower than the 500 billion rupees estimated before Russia invaded Ukraine.It’s difficult for the government to delay it further.”The government’s main challenge is that while it has pared down the size of LIC IPO, the sale will still be India’s biggest, surpassing the listing of One 97 Communications Ltd., which raised about 183 billion rupees in November.",['Life Insurance Corporation'],"['about 210 billion rupees', '$2.8 billion', '500 billion', 'more than $16 billion', '6 trillion', '650 billion', 'One 97 Communications Ltd.', 'about 183 billion rupees']"
Sebi considers exempting LIC from mandatory 5% float in IPO,25 April,"The government, which has time till May 12 to launch the LIC IPO without filing fresh papers with the market regulator, will not launch a follow on public offering (FPO) for a year after listing even as the watchdog considers exemption sought from compulsory five percent listing on float, sources told CNBC-TV18.Under the current rules, if the post-issue capital of a company calculated at the offer price is above Rs 1 lakh crore, it's required to issue shares worth Rs 5,000 crore and five percent of equity.If the offer is less than that calculated under this norm for large companies, the government will need exemption from the watchdog.The five percent IPO norm could result in a Rs 35,000 crore issue, and it is unlikely that the market would have the appetite for a public issue of that size.This comes after Bloomberg reported on April 22 the size of the IPO may be slashed by 40 percent from Rs 55,000-60,000 crore to Rs 30,000 crore.Typically, firms can't do an FPO for six months after float.LIC had filed its draft papers for IPO on February 13.

"MC Interview | $200 mn ARR is when we shall look to float an IPO, says Vedantu co-founder Vamsi Krishna",21 April,"Vamsi Krishna, co-founder and chief executive of edtech unicorn Vedantu says his firm grew more than 8X in terms of revenue in past two years. In an Interview with Moneycontrol, Krishna, said the company is targeting a $200 million ARR (annual recurring revenue) within next 18 months, and that’s when Vedantu will look to float an IPO.He said, the company will be happy to achieve a 25 percent margin by then, and the edtech will continue to invest more for market penetration.Krishna, clarified that while hybrid model has a future potential, Vedantu is not immediately going for opening physical centres, or offer hybrid education.He said while in last two years, his firm and the edtech sector saw some hyper growth (10X to 12X), this will taper to a good growth phase (4X to 5X) this year. Edited excerpts:Is Vedantu set to open physical centres like few other peers?As of now, we are not doing hybrid; no plans of it. What we spoke is a future potential.When will Vendantu do it exhaustively and formally? Unfortunately, we don’t have a timeline. It’s a long way before we seriously attempt it. Me and the other co-founders believe that there are possibilities of innovation in those models, and I believe some great models can come out of it.What is the growth chart of Vedantu for the for next two to three years?The immediate target, we have taken, and we should reach there is in about 18 months. We are targeting a $200 million ARR. That’s a zone, where we can think of getting listed, it’s a zone for potential IPO. Had it been last year, it would have happened in 12 months’ time.Many sectors including ours that got a good traction in past two years, will shift from a hyper growth stage to growth stage. From almost a 10-12x kind of growth to around 4X to 5X kind of growth is what I am foreseeing.From the numbers you are speaking, will be it safe to say you are at a $40mn to $50mn ARR now? I cannot share the exact numbers, but it’s much more than that. I think last June-July-August-- we were probably at that level. Now we are much higher.How was the past year from revenue point of view?It was very good. Obviously the year before was even crazy. In past two years (April 2020-March 2022), we grew between 8X to 12x depending on which number one talks about.Our paid students base grew by almost 11.5X to 12X in the same time frame. In terms of revenue, we grew almost 4 to 4.5X in the first year and doubled last fiscal (which means, it is over 8X growth in 2 years).Before IPO, you mentioned an 18 month timeline and $200 million ARR. Are you also looking to become profitable before that?Why $200mn – because we believe it’s a good number to target. It won’t stop there; it will only grow. Inherent to this is profit profile. I told you that last fiscal we grew 2X, but our profitability must have grown 3X during the same period. When we are targeting the number, we are contemplating whether it will lead to 25% margin or 30% margin. Anywhere above 25%, we shall be super happy.Since 95% of the market is yet to be penetrated, and (we are expanding) …these need a lot of investment. As a CEO, I am not really (worried), as long as we have investment budgets. Our investments will continue. If that puts us in ebidta negative, then be it. We are making calculated investments.  Yes, all businesses are running on a profitable mode and cash generation is important. We believe that investments are important for market penetration.What has changed for Vedantu after turning a Unicorn ?Nothing for us, to be honest.

Govt to take call on LIC IPO timing this week,21 April,"The government is likely to take a call on the timing of LIC initial public offering within this week, a senior official said.The sale of 5 per cent stake or 31.6 crore shares in the country's largest insurer was originally planned for in March, but was postponed in view of the geopolitical tension.The government has time till May 12 to launch the IPO without filing fresh papers with markets regulator Sebi.The official said it would be a tough call to decide whether to go ahead with the retail and domestic investor demand or to wait for geopolitical tension to ease and FIIs to return to market.''A decision on timing the IPO would be taken this week,'' the official told PTI.LIC's embedded value, which is a measure of the consolidated shareholders' value in an insurance company, was pegged at about Rs 5.4 lakh crore as of September 30, 2021, by international actuarial firm Milliman Advisors.There were estimates made in certain quarters that LIC's market valuation would be about 2-3 times its embedded value. The official said that for a company of the magnitude of LIC, such high multiplier to embedded value may not be correct.The official further said the IPO price would have to be fixed in a way that on the listing day there is an upside to the stock and investors get rewarded.“LIC is already a matured company and has seen business growth since its inception. The market valuation would have to be done keeping in mind its growth potential here-on,” the official added.If the IPO is not launched now then it would have to be deferred till August or September since fresh papers with updated quarterly results and valuations would have to be filed with Sebi.If the government decides to go ahead with the initial public offering by May 12 then the life insurer will have to file the red herring prospectus with Sebi by next week.The official also said that under the present market condition the government is unlikely to offload more than 5 per cent stake in the life insurance behemoth. “When we are already facing headwinds, we cannot test waters with higher IPO size.” The finance ministry did not respond to the e-mail seeking comments for the story.The government is planning to sell about 31.6 crore or 5 per cent stake in the life insurance behemoth.LIC IPO would contribute a major chunk to the budgeted disinvestment proceeds in the current fiscal year.

Dubai utility surges after pulling off year’s second-biggest IPO,12 April,"Dubai Electricity & Water Authority jumped in its trading debut after raising $6.1 billion in the world’s second-biggest initial public offering this year.Shares of Dubai’s main utility rose 20% to 2.98 dirhams from the offer price of 2.48 dirhams, which was the top end of the marketed range. The IPO valued DEWA at $33.8 billion.The deal is the latest sign of feverish appetite for IPOs from the Arab Gulf. DEWA almost tripled the size of its offer to 18% in the face of huge demand, drawing orders worth $86 billion, excluding cornerstone and strategic investors.Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has shuttered global IPO markets, already buckling under the weight of surging inflation and monetary policy tightening. The Middle East sidestepped the worst of the volatility, while soaring energy prices boosted cash reserves for local investors, who have been keen to put the money to work.DEWA priced its IPO for an implied dividend yield of 5%, a boon as rising interest rates make companies that provide steady income more attractive.

Glencore regains IPO price after 11 years on commodity rally,11 April,"Glencore Plc traded above its IPO price for the first time since 2011 as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine continues to drive up commodity prices.The shares breached 530 pence in London on Monday after surging 42% this year. It’s a level Glencore, the world’s biggest commodities trader, had at times looked unlikely to ever regain.Nearly all the company’s most important commodities are trading at or near record levels. Markets from metals to oil and gas have been upended by the war in Ukraine as big corporates withdraw from Russia, lenders pull back from financing deals and the threat of new sanctions deters buyers. The Bloomberg Commodity Spot Index has surged 26% this year.The milestone also caps a strong 12 months for Glencore itself. The company in February reported record earnings, announcing $4 billion in dividends and buybacks, and said it expects to resolve long-running corruption probes by U.S., U.K. and Brazilian authorities this year.Glencore first sold shares in 2011 at the height of the last commodity super cycle, and hit an all-time high of 547.209 pence soon after. Since then, its stock has remained well below those levels, trading as low as 66.67 pence during the 2015 commodity crash.For years, Glencore’s shares also underperformed many of its biggest rivals, as the company missed out on rising prices for iron ore -- which it doesn’t produce -- and investors were deterred by sprawling anti-corruption investigations.However, the commodities giant has positioned itself to be one of the biggest winners from what some analysts see as a new commodity supercycle, with a sprawling suite of mines producing many of the materials needed for the energy transition.

"Primary Market in FY23: A repeat of FY22 likely, could be even better",06 April,"India saw a frenetic rush for floating public issues with 53 companies mopping up Rs 1.18 lakh crore from the primary market in the fiscal year ended March 31. The momentum will sustain this year as well, according to experts.The companies that went public in FY22 raised 3.7 times more than Rs 31,268 crore raised a year back when about 30 companies had launched their IPOs.The data shows that the previous best year for the primary markets in terms of total funds raised in a financial year was FY18 when close to Rs 81,500 crore were raised by the listing corporates.The new-age digital players that went listed on stock exchanges in FY22 included Paytm, Nykaa, Policy Bazaar and Zomato. These companies defied the traditional valuation matrices and attracted many investors, especially the first-time retail investors, with lucrative growth stories despite their hefty valuations.In fact, these new-age digital firms raised the highest fresh capital during the year with public issues like Paytm garnering Rs 18,300 crore and Zomato Rs 9,375 crore. Paytm, in the process, became the biggest IPO ever, as it surpassed Rs 15,200 crore raised by Coal India in 2010.Barring a few, most of these companies that were backed by private equity or venture capital firms, received tremendous response from investors and went listed at substantial premiums. They traded with good positive momentum in 2021 but fate turned sour from the start of 2022 as the secondary market turned volatile on concerns surrounding the potential interest rate hike by US Fed.“This led to a sharp correction in the share price of these new tech companies and dried up IPOs in the fourth quarter,” said Sneha Poddar, AVP Research, Broking and Distribution, Motilal Oswal Financial Services.As bulls began raging the secondary market from the start of 2022, a strong ripple effect reached the simmering primary market, making a strong case for promoters and PE/VC investors to demand the highest valuations for their companies. Retail investors flock to these offers in hoards throwing caution and rationality to the wind.“Despite a lacklustre fourth quarter, we believe the primary market would continue with its buoyancy in FY23 as well, as good economic recovery, de-escalation of tensions between Russia and Ukraine and return of FII inflows have improved the investor sentiments once again,” Poddar said. Good listing by many IPOs in FY22 has also instilled confidence in investors.The PE/VC investors made a killing through these IPOs during the strong bull run. Data shows that PE/VC investors managed to take home a mammoth Rs 82,700 crore from the Indian primary markets which is more than four times the amount they made in FY21.What the retail investors fail to understand is the fact that when market sentiments change, these companies which were commanding hefty valuations, underperform considerably. Although the BSE IPO index beat the Sensex in FY22, it has underperformed by 17 percent over the last six months.National markets regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) has already given its observations and approvals to 56 companies seeking to go listed. The companies aim to mop up a massive Rs 1.4 lakh crore in FY23.The year is also likely to see the biggest public issue in the history of the Indian primary market with the Life Insurance Corporation of India aiming to raise around  Rs 65,000-70,000 crore from dilution of 5 percent government holding. The company's 31.60 crore shares are expected to hit the market in May.“The Centre fell far short of its initial disinvestment objective of Rs 1.75 lakh crore for FY22, receiving only Rs 13,531 crore,” said Mohit Nigam, Head of PMS at Hem Securities. In FY23, it may set a new high on this front. “According to the present plan, thanks to the projected LIC IPO, the Centre's disinvestment revenues could exceed the annual disinvestment target of Rs 65,000 crore for the current fiscal in Q1 itself.”While 56 companies have got the Sebi green light to float their public issues, 41 more are in the queue. Approvals to these companies will add another Rs 81,000 crore to the fund-raise pipeline.“Apart from LIC, many more new age companies are likely to come up with IPOs in the coming months. These include the likes of Oyo, Ola, Pharmeasy, Delhivery, Byjus, MobiKwik, Snapdeal, FLipkart, Swiggy and Ixigo,” said Poddar. It could push the FY23 fund-raising through IPO beyond the FY22 figure.IPOs of FY22—a mix of outperformers and underperformersA word of cautionWhile the markets are largely in control of bulls, there are certain fundamentals that trigger a cause for concern for investors as well as policymakers.“Rise in developed market interest rates normally affects flows in emerging market equities, so there will be some impact on the markets - secondary markets, more than the primary markets,” said Venkatraghavan S, Managing Director and Head of Equity Capital Markets, Equirus.Domestic inflation risk is there, and along with increasing global interest rates, domestic interest rates will also rise. However, domestic liquidity continues to be robust.“IPOs in new sectors, or differentiated companies will still see good interest, however, me-too companies will have to have attractive valuations to be successful,” Venkatraghavan said. “In summary, I expect the primary markets to still be reasonable, if not as robust as the previous year.”It is of utmost importance for investors to analyse each IPO based on its strength and should not get affected by the ‘fear of missing out’ (FOMO). The markets are known for bringing the correct valuations to the fore and overpriced companies are bound to come down to their actual value once the initial euphoria wanes off, as cane be seen in 38 percent of the total IPOs in FY22 which declined between 8-76 percent compared to their issue price.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips of investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

14 Times the market fooled investors,01 April,"We’ve all been fooled by some prank on April Fools’ day or for that matter on any random given day. And as tempting, as it can get to fool readers, the folks at smallcase decided to change the game and help investors debunk pranks by the market this year.Atanuu Agarrwal, Co-Founder and CEO of Upside AI along with Srikanth Meenakshi, Co-Founder, PrimeInvestor and Arvind Kothari, Founder and CEO of Niveshaay have taken it upon themselves to talk about 14 times the market fooled investors.Atanuu Agarrwal, Co-Founder, UpsideAI “Modern humanity is sick with FOMO – Fear of Missing Out – and though we have more choice than ever before, we have lost the ability to really pay attention to whatever we choose.” – Yuval Noah Harari. Markets often fool us when we fall prey to FOMO.One of the most famous examples is of course when Isaac Newton, lost a fortune on a “hot” stock (South Sea) bubble.But this happens very often in modern times as well. Look at Sensex’s behaviour between 2006-and 2008. In 2006, the Sensex went up 47%. I am sure a lot of folks were expecting the market to correct but next year, in 2007, the Sensex went up another 47%. Now there was a ton of irrational exuberance around and bullish investors probably felt invincible. However, in 2008, the Sensex went DOWN 51%! and the tables turned.Most times when investors are “fooled” by the markets it results from the inability to accept that they are wrong. On average we don’t seem to be able to learn from history, as the age-old saying goes – “fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me”.Use Promo code FLASH50 for 50% OFF on your subscription, Validity: 3rd April’22Titans smallcase by Upside AIArvind Kothari, Founder, Niveshaay What Initial Public Offering, its FOMO of double your money in 25 days! Naïve investors get trapped by the fear of missing out. This extreme FOMO of IPO hype is now taking away all the CASHBACK they received leaving no money in their wallet to buy POLICY from the BAZAAR.Bought the dip and became the dip. Both such stocks and advice are nothing but end up becoming SIN (TEX).Just when you thought that now the markets are going to be up, the market fooled you!Fooled by RandomnessPeople consider luck as a skill. In the eyes of a market fool, losses always happen due to bad luck, while profits always come due to skills.“Taare Zameen Par” nahi hote!You come across some companies available at cheap valuations and get lured to buy them. Not every time those stocks are hidden gems but a value trap. They are undervalued for a reason and investors miss onto those reasons and get fooled.It’s all about TimingWe always wait for the right time to invest and whenever we do that, we end up losing.Green Energy smallcase by NiveshaaySrikanth Meenakshi, Co-Founder, PrimeInvestor There are multiple instances of people getting fooled in the markets, but of course it is debatable whether the market fooled the investors or if the investors fooled themselves. Most times, it is the latter, but there are times when the market behaved in a deceptive way to lead investors astray.The 2020 head-fake - the most recent and memorable instance of market fooling investors was the Covid head-fake of March 2020. Markets dove with concerns about the global recession with the onset of the Covid pandemic, and investors, logically, ran for cover. But the subsequent liquidity infusions across the world and stimulus packages created a sustained bull run across the board making those who exited the market in fear look like fools.There were several times when investors got deluded by 'narratives' without focusing on the fundamentals. Obviously, these happen during irrational bull runs when people are looking for excuses to deploy money and instruments to invest in. Around the turn of the century, it was all about eyeballs and traffic that led to the tech bubble. About a decade later, the capex bubble of 2007/08 was about land banks and order books. Even in private equity markets, a few years later, it was about GMV. Every single one of these times, asset prices were inevitably subject to the gravitational pull of revenues, earnings, ROE and other fundamental metrics. These narratives fooled investors into believing that this time the market would rely on other metrics.Investing in companies that are on their way to oblivion - for some reason, when it is clear that a company has entered into bankruptcy proceedings and is in the process of getting liquidated, investors still find an excuse to keep trading in the stock waiting for some miracle to happen. The most recent example of this was the case with DHFL where the shares were ultimately extinguished leaving these speculators holding the bag. Other examples include Jet Airways and Jaypee Infratech.Finally, there is always the 'rug-pull' that happens when markets start celebrating new public offerings and raise valuations to the stratosphere. This classic case of 'lift and spike' happens often, and most recently in 2021 when the bubble burst spectacularly with the advent of Paytm's much-hyped issue.PrimeInvestor Financial Disruptors smallcase by PrimeInvestorWell, here’s to hoping that these 14 cases of Mr. Market’s pranks don’t get hold of us investors gain.To read more about smallcase on MoneyControl, click here.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/14-times-the-market-fooled-investors-8306591.html,IPO,"And as tempting, as it can get to fool readers, the folks at smallcase decided to change the game and help investors debunk pranks by the market this year.Atanuu Agarrwal, Co-Founder and CEO of Upside AI along with Srikanth Meenakshi, Co-Founder, PrimeInvestor and Arvind Kothari, Founder and CEO of Niveshaay have taken it upon themselves to talk about 14 times the market fooled investors.Atanuu Agarrwal, Co-Founder, UpsideAI “Modern humanity is sick with FOMO – Fear of Missing Out – and though we have more choice than ever before, we have lost the ability to really pay attention to whatever we choose.” – Yuval Noah Harari.They are undervalued for a reason and investors miss onto those reasons and get fooled.It’s all about TimingWe always wait for the right time to invest and whenever we do that, we end up losing.Green Energy smallcase by NiveshaaySrikanth Meenakshi, Co-Founder, PrimeInvestor There are multiple instances of people getting fooled in the markets, but of course it is debatable whether the market fooled the investors or if the investors fooled themselves.","['Atanuu Agarrwal', 'Co-Founder', 'Co-Founder', 'Atanuu Agarrwal', 'Co-Founder', 'Green Energy', 'Co-Founder']",[]

Volkswagen selects banks for porsche sports car IPO,31 March,"Volkswagen AG has chosen lead banks for the blockbuster listing of iconic sports-car maker Porsche in what could be one of Europe’s biggest initial public offerings this year, people with knowledge of the matter said.Europe’s largest automaker has picked firms including Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Bank of America Corp. and JPMorgan Chase & Co. as joint global coordinators for the proposed share sale, the people said. The listing could value Porsche at as much as 90 billion euros ($100 billion), the people said, asking not to be identified because the information is private.VW plans to add more banks to the deal, according to the people. PJT Partners Inc. is advising the billionaire Porsche and Piech families who control their holding company Porsche Automobil Holding SE, the people said. JPMorgan -- alongside its role at Volkswagen on the IPO -- has been helping the family holding company as well.Representatives for VW and the banks declined to comment.Europe’s largest automaker is planning a listing of a minority stake in Porsche, one of its most coveted assets, in the fourth quarter to help finance the industry’s biggest push into electric cars and boost its valuation. If VW goes ahead as currently planned, the IPO would allow the Porsche and Piech family to claw back direct influence in what used to be their family enterprise.VW has earmarked 89 billion euros in spending on technologies like software and electric cars through 2026, and the separation of Porsche could offer new funding options for the group. VW largely relies on generating enough cash on its own or issue bonds as its convoluted shareholder structure limits options to raise fresh equity capital.A listing would revive an otherwise anemic market for IPOs, which have plummeted in the first quarter as volatility stoked by the war in Ukraine and soaring inflation puts investors on edge. Preparations for the listing are continuing, though negative implications because of the conflict cannot be ruled out, Porsche SE Chief Financial Officer Johannes Lattwein said Tuesday.VW’s track record on major structural changes is mixed, even as the group has long sought to simplify its sprawling setup. A listing of Traton SE, VW’s truckmaking unit, struggled to gain traction amid internal ructions and a limited free float, while a push to separate the Lamborghini supercar and Ducati motorcycle brands failed.A listing of the maker of the iconic 911 and electric Taycan could see the brand try to emulate the success of Ferrari NV, which was separated from Fiat Chrysler to reach a valuation more akin to luxury fashion brand Hermes International. Ferrari’s enterprise value trades at more than 22 times earnings before interest, tax and amortization for this year. This compares to a multiple of just 1.8 for Volkswagen.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/world/volkswagen-selects-banks-for-porsche-sports-car-ipo-8298421.html,IPO,"JPMorgan -- alongside its role at Volkswagen on the IPO -- has been helping the family holding company as well.Representatives for VW and the banks declined to comment.Europe’s largest automaker is planning a listing of a minority stake in Porsche, one of its most coveted assets, in the fourth quarter to help finance the industry’s biggest push into electric cars and boost its valuation.A listing of Traton SE, VW’s truckmaking unit, struggled to gain traction amid internal ructions and a limited free float, while a push to separate the Lamborghini supercar and Ducati motorcycle brands failed.A listing of the maker of the iconic 911 and electric Taycan could see the brand try to emulate the success of Ferrari NV, which was separated from Fiat Chrysler to reach a valuation more akin to luxury fashion brand Hermes International.","['JPMorgan', 'Volkswagen', 'IPO', 'VW', 'Porsche', 'VW', 'Ferrari NV', 'Fiat Chrysler', 'Hermes International']","['as much as 90 billion euros', '$100 billion', '89 billion']"
"Mankind working on upto $1 billion IPO, one of the largest ever in pharma space",28 April,"One of India’s biggest unlisted pharmaceutical firms, ChrysCapital-backed Mankind Pharma, the maker of top selling condom brand Manforce Condoms, Kaloree 1 and Prega News, has initiated preliminary discussions with investment bankers to launch a mega IPO in 2022, multiple industry sources in the know told Moneycontrol.“Pitches were held for the proposed IPO of Mankind Pharma earlier this week. These are early days and the listing is aimed at facilitating a partial exit for its investors who are looking at returns within a time frame,” said one of the persons cited above.Other than ChrysCapital, the drugmaker is backed by the likes of Capital International and Singapore’s GIC. In 2015, Capital International had purchased an 11 percent stake in Mankind Pharma from ChrysCapital for $200 million. In April 2018, a ChrysCapital-led consortium, which included GIC and CPPPIB, made a stunning comeback and bought a 10 percent stake again for around $350 million.A second person said that the valuation of Mankind Pharma could potentially range between $8 billion and $10 billion.“It’s a cash-rich firm and it's likely that the IPO may chiefly consist of an OFS or offer for sale component by the investors.""A third person confirmed the above valuation range and added that the fast-growing firm had reached the desired size and scale for a listing. He said the syndicate of i-bankers for the deal could be finalised in April.If one were to consider a minimum dilution of a 10 percent stake, then the size of the proposed IPO could range between$800 million and $1 billion, making it one of the biggest ever IPOs in the pharma segment.The current record in the sector is held by Gland Pharma which launched an $869 million IPO in November 2020.A fourth person told Moneycontrol that a clutch of as many as 10 to 12 foreign and domestic investment banks had made presentations for the IPO mandate.“They have a strong OTC business and they have seen the moves made by IPO-bound pharma peers like Bain Capital-backed Emcure Pharma and Macleod Pharma,” this person added.Unwanted-21 (oral contraceptive), AcneStar, Gas-O-Fast and KabzEnd (Ayurvedic product which treats constipation) are some of the other brands in the Mankind Pharma portfolio.A fifth person familiar with Mankind Pharma said that when ChrysCapital re-entered the firm in 2018, there would have been discussions on future exit strategies.“The firm has been trying to expand their OTC products business for better margins and that shift has been accelerated since ChrysCapital came on board. They have built a good number of brands over the years and made them stronger,” this person elaborated.All the five persons cited above spoke to Moneycontrol on condition of anonymity.Moneycontrol has sent email queries along with reminders and is awaiting responses from Mankind Pharma, ChrysCapital and GIC.

IPO-bound Oyo files request for exemption with SEBI amid delay in listing,28 March,"Softbank-backed hotel aggregator Oyo's parent Oravel Stays Limited filed a request for exemption late last month, according to information available on market regulator SEBI's website.The request is under process according to the posting on the website, which did not provide details on the type of exemption sought.People familiar with the development told Moneycontrol that Oyo is seeking SEBI's permission to file an updated draft prospectus instead of a new one, as there are material changes since it initially filed for an IPO late last year.""When a firm files the DRHP, the financials shouldn't be more than six months old.

"IPO market plunges 70% as higher rates, war curb risk appetite",27 March,"Initial public offerings worldwide have plummeted in the first quarter after a record showing in 2021, as volatility stoked by the war in Ukraine and soaring inflation sets investors on edge and scuppers deals.About $65 billion has been raised via IPOs around the world in 2022, down 70% from $219 billion in the first three months of last year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That puts the global market on track for the lowest quarterly proceeds since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic in 2020.Still, companies such as renewable-energy provider Plenitude and skin-care business Galderma are lining up to test investors’ appetite for new shares in the coming months.ALSO READ: Nasdaq-listed Yatra Online’s Indian subsidiary files papers for an IPOStock market listings set a record in 2021 as unprecedented stimulus measures fueled a surge in global equities to all-time highs. Now, the backdrop couldn’t be more different, with central banks raising interest rates in response to mounting inflation and investors spooked by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.COVID-19 VaccineFrequently Asked QuestionsA vaccine works by mimicking a natural infection. A vaccine not only induces immune response to protect people from any future COVID-19 infection, but also helps quickly build herd immunity to put an end to the pandemic. Herd immunity occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population becomes immune to a disease, making the spread of disease from person to person unlikely. The good news is that SARS-CoV-2 virus has been fairly stable, which increases the viability of a vaccine.There are broadly four types of vaccine — one, a vaccine based on the whole virus (this could be either inactivated, or an attenuated [weakened] virus vaccine); two, a non-replicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of SARS-CoV; three, nucleic-acid vaccines that have genetic material like DNA and RNA of antigens like spike protein given to a person, helping  human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine; and four, protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombinant proteins of SARS-COV-2 along with an adjuvant (booster) is given as a vaccine.Vaccine development is a long, complex process. Unlike drugs that are given to people with a diseased, vaccines are given to healthy people and also vulnerable sections such as children, pregnant women and the elderly. So rigorous tests are compulsory. History says that the fastest time it took to develop a vaccine is five years, but it usually takes double or sometimes triple that time.“This is probably the worst time in five years in terms of market sentiment,” said Li Hang, head of equity capital markets and syndicate at brokerage CLSA.Rising interest rates combined with sharp market swings have prompted investors to steer clear of companies with high forecast growth rates yet relatively little in the way of current profits --- the kind of stocks that dominate the IPO market. IPO Slump | PC-Bloomberg.“You need a more stable market to find the level at which IPOs can clear,” said Saadi Soudavar, Deutsche Bank AG’s co-head of equity capital markets for Europe, the Middle East and Africa.The Cboe Volatility Index, a widely watched gauge of expected market swings, jumped above 30 when Russia invaded Ukraine and has had an average reading of about 26 this year, signaling IPOs might be too risky of an investment to receive sufficient appetite. Historically, a majority of global listings have been priced when the index has been below 25.Wild market swings have scuttled IPOs from New York to New Delhi. Life Insurance Corp., which planned to raise as much as 654 billion rupees ($8.5 billion) for the Indian government with an offering before the end of March, now is looking at a mid-May timeline. The offering would be one of the largest global listings this year.Even quick-fire deals such as blank-check offerings, which are typically priced in a matter of days, are falling by the wayside. The vehicles, also known as special purpose acquisition companies, are shelving their listings at a record pace this year as investor enthusiasm wanes due to poor returns and heightened regulatory scrutiny.Investment banks are starting to feel the effects: UBS Group AG began laying off a handful of bankers in equity capital markets in Europe, the Middle East and Africa this month, according to people familiar with the matter.Bright SpotsIt’s not all doom and gloom, however. While follow-on share sales start to pick up from Asia to Europe and the U.S., IPOs have been bucking the global trend and racing ahead in the Middle East, where high oil prices and rising interest rates are helping regional markets sharply outperform international ones.“The Middle East is the one bright spot in an otherwise quiet global ECM market,” said Andree Chakhtoura, head of investment banking for the Middle East and North Africa at Bank of America Corp. “There is a wider and deeper market now than there has ever been before, and the offering is diversified.”Many major commodities are trading at or near record levels, with the war in Ukraine raising supply concerns. This has already begun to spur capital markets activity.Qatar’s sovereign wealth fund cashed in on a $1 billion stake in Glencore Plc via an overnight transaction March 23, while WE Soda, one of the world’s largest producers of natural soda ash, is evaluating options including a London IPO, Bloomberg News reported.Strong FinishBankers continue to bet on a recovery in the second quarter, fueled in part by a full pipeline of large listing candidates readying to tap public investors, and the green shoots of a stock market rebound.“A key question is when we can price the substantial pipeline of European IPOs waiting in the wings; we are hoping the answer is as early as May, June,” said Deutsche Bank’s Soudavar.A number of high-profile listings from the likes of Thyssenkrupp AG’s Nucera and Italian green hydrogen specialist Industrie De Nora SpA are in the works in Europe. In the U.S., Rihanna’s Savage X Fenty lingerie company and SoftBank Group Corp.-backed chipmaker Arm Ltd. are among the big-ticket IPOs bankers are working on.In Asia, private equity firm PAG and electric-vehicle maker Hozon New Energy Automobile Co. are in the pipeline with billion-dollar-plus offerings.“The glass half-full view is that we could be in for a busy second quarter in equity capital markets,” said Andreas Bernstorff, BNP Paribas SA’s head of equity capital markets for Europe, Middle East and Africa. “Would expect to see block trades and equity-linked deals pick up first, and IPOs scheduled after Easter on the back of first-quarter numbers.”",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/ipo-market-plunges-70-as-higher-rates-war-curb-risk-appetite-8278711.html,IPO,"While follow-on share sales start to pick up from Asia to Europe and the U.S., IPOs have been bucking the global trend and racing ahead in the Middle East, where high oil prices and rising interest rates are helping regional markets sharply outperform international ones.“The Middle East is the one bright spot in an otherwise quiet global ECM market,” said Andree Chakhtoura, head of investment banking for the Middle East and North Africa at Bank of America Corp. “There is a wider and deeper market now than there has ever been before, and the offering is diversified.”Many major commodities are trading at or near record levels, with the war in Ukraine raising supply concerns.This has already begun to spur capital markets activity.Qatar’s sovereign wealth fund cashed in on a $1 billion stake in Glencore Plc via an overnight transaction March 23, while WE Soda, one of the world’s largest producers of natural soda ash, is evaluating options including a London IPO, Bloomberg News reported.Strong FinishBankers continue to bet on a recovery in the second quarter, fueled in part by a full pipeline of large listing candidates readying to tap public investors, and the green shoots of a stock market rebound.“A key question is when we can price the substantial pipeline of European IPOs waiting in the wings; we are hoping the answer is as early as May, June,” said Deutsche Bank’s Soudavar.A number of high-profile listings from the likes of Thyssenkrupp AG’s Nucera and Italian green hydrogen specialist Industrie De Nora SpA are in the works in Europe.","['ECM', 'Bank of', 'Glencore Plc', 'Soda', 'IPO', 'Bloomberg News', 'Deutsche Bank’s Soudavar', 'Thyssenkrupp AG’s', 'Nucera']","['About $65 billion', '$219 billion', 'as much as 654 billion rupees', '$8.5 billion', '$1 billion', 'billion-dollar']"

"What Paytm, Zomato and other IPOs can teach when applying for LIC shares",17 March,"Billed to be the country’s biggest public issue in history, the share sale by Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC) may be delayed, but cannot be denied.A large number of retail investors are keen to apply for the shares, especially given how some recent IPOs performed initially, as some stocks turned out multi-baggers for shareholders. However, as the market turned volatile, they were reminded of the old lessons around ‘greed and fear’ in various ways. While making an informed decision about going in for the LIC IPO, here are certain things investors should keep in mind.Valuations and fundamentalsInvestors keep making the same mistakes and it was no different during the recent IPO wave. Chasing hot themes generally does not work. In CY2021, the technology-driven companies were all the rage. But not all of them made money. The shares of Paytm operator One97 Communications (PAYTM) have lost two-thirds of their value from the IPO price of Rs 2,150 and trade at Rs 634 each. Others such as CarTrade Tech and PB Fintech are also quoting below the IPO price.Also read | Paytm free fall hurts, Vijay Shekhar Sharma no longer a billionaire“Stock prices tend to track the fundamentals of the underlying business. If the company is not making money or is in a very competitive industry without any edge, then in turbulent times shares of such companies go down and may take time to bounce back till fundamentals improve. Shares of fundamentally strong good quality companies tend to bounce back quickly when the sentiment improves,” says Sneha Poddar, AVP, retail research, Motilal Oswal Financial Services.Many of these new-age companies focused on customer acquisitions and profitability took a back seat. Conservative investors have to wait for the companies to turn profitable and later post consistent profitable growth. “Valuations are important and in the case of new-age companies, they were expensive. Also, many investors did not have clarity on how to value these new-age IPOs,” says Deepak Jasani, head, retail research, HDFC Securities.Do you really understand the business?Many successful investors including Warren Buffett talk about investing in a ‘circle of competence’, the subject area that matches a person's skills or expertise. It says an investor is better placed to make investment decisions if he or she understands the underlying business.However, investors often confuse this to mean familiarity. When the new-age businesses were offered through the IPO route to the public at large, many people mistook the familiarity element—several of them had used the services offered by these companies as consumers—as their understanding and made decisions on their own. “Being a customer, you can have an opinion about the quality of the goods and services. But that does not mean a customer understands the business model, margins, profitability, future growth and valuations of the business,” says Mohit Nigam, head, portfolio management services, Hem Securities.Among the stocks that were listed in the last one year, quality businesses such as Clean Science & Technology and Ami Organics, both in specialty chemical manufacturing, and Sona BLW Precision Forgings, an automotive technology company, did well.Investors backing strong businesses after taking experts’ inputs did well.Listing gain or investmentMany a time, investors fail to understand why they are applying for shares in an IPO in the first place. Ignoring your investment goal and exit strategy is one of the biggest mistakes you can make.“Be clear about what kind of stock market we are operating in,” says Nigam. When you are applying purely for listing gain, an upward trending market helps. When the market is fuelled by liquidity and trading in the overbought zone, selling on listing makes sense, even if with small gains, and at times even with small losses. “When the markets are going up, one has to be cautious. There is a chance that investors land into traps in good times,” says Nigam.Investors however need to take a long-term view of the business. If you do your numbers right, then a rough patch in the stock market is a good time to add to your investments in IPOs.Stop loss can save youInvesting in an IPO requires a clear understanding of the business. But there are situations where despite all the efforts, one may go wrong. In that case, a ‘stop loss strategy’ can come to your rescue. “Define how much money you can afford to lose in each IPO. If the stock goes below that level, just sell,” advises Jasani.This will help you to avoid deep losses. If you keep a stop loss of, say, 20 percent, then you will exit at that level. Your losses won’t go beyond that.“After each IPO season, the number of stocks in investors’ portfolios goes up. It becomes difficult to track them. Sticking to a stop loss strategy will help you to keep the number of stocks in the portfolio in check,” adds Jasani.Even if the price of a stock goes up after hitting the stop loss, one can re-enter at a later stage if there is clarity about the future.Tax planningMany smart investors tend to book their capital losses to reduce the tax liability. In FY22, many investors are sitting on handsome profits despite the current turmoil. If you have some dud stocks received as IPO allotment, this can be a good time to take a relook at them. Consult your advisor. If you sell below the IPO price, you are booking your loss which can be offset against some other profit and bring down the tax liability as well.As the market returns to normalcy, you get many more opportunities to invest. If you free up your capital by selling dud stocks, then you are better placed to pick fundamentally strong companies.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/personal-finance/what-paytm-zomato-and-other-ipos-can-teach-when-applying-for-lic-shares-8240921.html,IPO,"But that does not mean a customer understands the business model, margins, profitability, future growth and valuations of the business,” says Mohit Nigam, head, portfolio management services, Hem Securities.Among the stocks that were listed in the last one year, quality businesses such as Clean Science & Technology and Ami Organics, both in specialty chemical manufacturing, and Sona BLW Precision Forgings, an automotive technology company, did well.Investors backing strong businesses after taking experts’ inputs did well.Listing gain or investmentMany a time, investors fail to understand why they are applying for shares in an IPO in the first place.Sticking to a stop loss strategy will help you to keep the number of stocks in the portfolio in check,” adds Jasani.Even if the price of a stock goes up after hitting the stop loss, one can re-enter at a later stage if there is clarity about the future.Tax planningMany smart investors tend to book their capital losses to reduce the tax liability.","['Hem Securities', 'Clean Science & Technology', 'Ami Organics', 'BLW', 'IPO']",[]

"Fincare SFB postpones IPO, cites external factors",14 March,"The hit taken by the bank on account of the COVID-19 pandemic and high volatility in the equity market arising from the Russia-Ukraine conflict have forced Fincare Small Finance Bank (SFB) to defer plans to list by July-August, the bank’s managing director and CEO Rajeev Yadav told Moneycontrol in an interaction on March 14. Yadav said the bank now aims to go public “at the earliest possible opportunity” in FY23.“We have all the regulatory approvals but the timing is largely driven by COVID and its impact on the bank and, therefore, this needs to settle down before we can go public. Obviously, global issues are also a factor at this point of time, but I am hoping that this impact will not last long. Since we have worked through the process of an IPO (initial public offering), we are just making sure that an appropriate window arrives for us to go public,” he said.In May, the SFB had filed the draft red herring prospectus (DRHP) with regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) to raise funds via an IPO. It is looking to raise Rs 1,330 crore through the offer which comprises a fresh issue of Rs 330 crore bank and an offer for sale of Rs 1,000 crore by promoter Fincare Business Services.As per the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) guidelines for ‘on tap’ licensing of SFBs in the private sector, an SFB has to be listed within three years of achieving a net worth of Rs 500 crore. Fincare SFB started operations on July 21, 2017, and as on March 31, 2021, had a total gross loan portfolio of Rs 6,072 crore and deposits amounting to Rs 5,318 crore.“The timeframes are there from a regulatory perspective (for listing of shares), which we have to work with the regulator and see what is the support or forbearance that we can get because COVID has been a very abnormal event,” Yadav said.Once the bank is listed, the promoter stake will come down by 10-25 percent depending on the dilution methodology, Yadav said. Presently, Fincare Business Services holds 78.4 percent in the small finance bank, he said.Yadav added that the SFB was keen on applying to the RBI for a reverse merger application but whether this will happen before or after the IPO is yet to be decided. There are seven SFBs that have a promoter structure presently, Yadav said, and most of them would want their promoter company to merge with the bank because it is just a holding company of the bank promoters’ shares and “not really serving any purpose at this point in time”.“The RBI has come up with facilitating guidelines of seeking the application around the five-year band and they then will work through the process. If everything is fine, they will give an NoC (no-objection certificate). Two listed SFBs have already applied… We are short of completing the five-year period, we will do that in July, and then we will be eligible for this process,” he said.Yadav said that in FY23, the bank’s thrust areas where it sees the highest growth are going to be mortgages and gold loans. The bank will also start offering two-wheeler loans in partnership with dealers and tie-up with a fintech for supply chain financing, apart from launching a composite set of services called community banking for microfinance customers.“We are also going to launch wealth solutions hopefully in a month’s time where we offer services including trading, demat and our own bank account. We are in the process of tying up with other specialised wealth management players,” he said.Several payments banks have been eyeing a small finance bank licence and when asked if this would post a competitive challenge to Fincare SFB’s growth plans, Yadav said the Indian credit market is over Rs 130 lakh crore and players with Rs 5,000 crore or Rs 10,000 crore of balance sheets do not make a significant impact. “I do not think there is a question of overcrowding. Everybody is working in this space by a specific mix of what their core strengths are,” Yadav said.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/banks/fincare-sfb-postpones-ipo-cites-external-factors-8231201.html,IPO,"Fincare SFB started operations on July 21, 2017, and as on March 31, 2021, had a total gross loan portfolio of Rs 6,072 crore and deposits amounting to Rs 5,318 crore.“The timeframes are there from a regulatory perspective (for listing of shares), which we have to work with the regulator and see what is the support or forbearance that we can get because COVID has been a very abnormal event,” Yadav said.Once the bank is listed, the promoter stake will come down by 10-25 percent depending on the dilution methodology, Yadav said.There are seven SFBs that have a promoter structure presently, Yadav said, and most of them would want their promoter company to merge with the bank because it is just a holding company of the bank promoters’ shares and “not really serving any purpose at this point in time”.“The RBI has come up with facilitating guidelines of seeking the application around the five-year band and they then will work through the process.","['Fincare SFB', 'COVID', 'RBI']",[]

"Swiggy picks I-Sec, JP Morgan for blockbuster IPO; may raise over $1 billion",08 March,"Food delivery company Swiggy, which is backed by South African internet giant Naspers and Japan’s Softbank, has kick-started preparations to launch a mega domestic initial public offer to raise around $1 billion and has engaged two investment bankers for the proposed listing as it looks to join rival Zomato in the listed universe, sources in the know told Moneycontrol.Zomato made a spectacular debut on the bourses in July 2021 but its stock price has plunged in recent times, a trend seen in other new-age tech stocks as well.“Investment banks ICICI Securities and JP Morgan have been taken on board by Swiggy as of now. More banks may be added later. This will be a big IPO and based on valuations, the firm may look at potentially raising in excess of a billion dollars,” said one of the people cited above.Two other persons confirmed the development. One of them added that Swiggy planned to file the DRHP (draft red herring prospectus) with Sebi by June and a launch could happen in 2022 or early 2023 depending on market conditions.According to the third person, Swiggy’s cost structure, traction around its new business initiatives (beyond the core food delivery segment) like quick grocery service Instamart and strong domestic focus are factors that bode well for its listing plans.He said that the IPO was likely to be a combination of primary and secondary issuance of shares which would facilitate growth capital and a partial exit for the firm’s long list of investors.All the three persons cited above spoke to Moneycontrol on condition of anonymity.Moneycontrol could not elicit an immediate comment from Swiggy and will update this article as soon as we hear from the firm. ICICI Securities declined to comment and Moneycontrol is awaiting an email response from JP Morgan.SWIGGY: THE VALUATION STORYIn January, Swiggy raised $700 million at a valuation of $10.7 billion, doubling its valuation in six months.

NSE IPO uncertain; detailed KYC only for shareholding over 2%: Vikram Limaye,08 March,"Among India’s pride, the National Stock Exchange (NSE) has been in the thick of controversy over misgovernance and suspected political patronage, which resulted in a change of guard in 2017. Since taking over as MD and CEO, Vikram Limaye surely had not had it easy trying to manage expectations of stakeholders. As he comes close to completing five years, he answers questions related to legacy issues, and talks about the transformation efforts he and his team have undertaken. When you took over as the CEO of NSE, what was the brief given to you?There was no brief given to me, per se. I was aware of the situation. Colo investigation had begun. It was a crisis situation. So my task was to take into account the relationship with all stakeholders -- regulators, members, media, shareholders – each one had different issues, which had to be addressed. Equally important was transformation at NSE -- governance, technology, processes, business as well as culture transformation. Now, we are at a good point. The issues of the past are largely behind us.During your tenure, was there any internal audit done beyond the specific points raised in the Colo case to detect any possible internal frauds?If you look at the Colo order, it exonerated all employees. The Colo order said the technology, that is, TCP/IP which was based on sequential access, was prone to providing preferential access. But that technology changed to multi-cast model in 2015 so the root-cause was addressed. Other review audits specified by Sebi (Securities and Exchange Board of India), like the governance audit, were conducted for independent validation. But nothing beyond that.Was there any specific investigation/internal audit on the areas of influence that Anand Subramanian had being the group operating officer?We did one comprehensive review of all aspects of the organisation. Was there anything specific pertaining to decisions taken by Subramanian? No, no such thing was done. Business, technology, regulatory did not report into him. Only HR, admin, premises were reporting into him, which was covered under the organisation-wide process and controls review anyway.There were issues with respect to client-code modification that Sebi had raised. Has NSE conducted any audit of those transactions to check if there was any intentional wrongdoing?The client-code modification issues have been fixed in discussions with CBDT when we applied for the commodities licence. We have not gone back to re-open client code modifications of the past.Have any of the investigating agencies/regulator asked for this sort of data relating to transactions related to client-code modifications?No.How big a priority is it for NSE to go public?NSE was not raising money for capital needs. The IPO was planned to offer liquidity to shareholders, so it does not affect NSE’s growth plans. Foreign investors have offloaded shares over the past two years. Have you been able to give them a roadmap?We are in regular contact with shareholders. They have also been engaging separately with the regulator and the government to get clarity on the listing. But there is no clarity yet.  What is the public listing contingent on? We have no idea. Sebi or the ministry have not provided any definitive clarity on when we can go public.SAT ruled that you could withdraw the Rs 6,000 crore Colo revenue that was disgorged by Sebi. Has that money now flown back to NSE?Rs 6,000 crore was not the disgorged amount. At one point in time, it was agreed with Sebi that NSE will put all Colo revenues into a separate bank account; this was not required which is why we had represented saying that we have already transferred the penalty and interest on account of Colo, which was north of Rs 1,000 crore. SAT accepted this, and the money has now flown back to NSE.What level of KYC is done by NSE on investors?Now the Sebi rule says that you had to do detailed KYC for “fit and proper” when the shareholding is more than 2%. For others, there is no detailed diligence done.  ",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/ipo-was-planned-to-offer-liquidity-to-shareholders-so-it-does-not-affect-nses-growth-plans-ceo-vikram-limaye-8204471.html,IPO,"The issues of the past are largely behind us.During your tenure, was there any internal audit done beyond the specific points raised in the Colo case to detect any possible internal frauds?If you look at the Colo order, it exonerated all employees.We have not gone back to re-open client code modifications of the past.Have any of the investigating agencies/regulator asked for this sort of data relating to transactions related to client-code modifications?No.How big a priority is it for NSE to go public?NSE was not raising money for capital needs.","['frauds?If', 'NSE']",[]

Explained: IPO rules for new age companies,28 February,"Alarm bells rang for the markets, investors and securities and commodities market regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) when the much-awaited initial public offering (IPO) of Paytm tanked on debut.Since then, the slide show has been going on for the payments company. The story of cosmetics retailer Nykaa has been a little different. It debuted at Rs 2,001, a 78 percent premium to its IPO price of Rs 1,125. However, it closed at Rs 1,294.20 on the BSE on Friday, February 25, 2020. Clearly, both these vaunted new-age companies have lost investor interest.While investors pay huge premiums for shares of new-age firms and are ready to wait for an extended period of time in the hope of making outsized returns when these companies turn profitable, the scenario for these companies in India has soured because of the impending US Fed tightening following rampaging inflation in the US, the possibility of easy money going out of circulation, and the Russia-Ukraine crisis.With investor wealth hugely eroded by these new-age companies, and many analysts calling out the outrageous valuations given to some of these loss-making firms, SEBI decided to bell the cat – it has proposed rules to tighten the IPO pricing of such companies.Here’s a look at the new rules proposed, and the rationale for them. SEBI has called for public comments on the proposed rules until March 5.Pricing of the IPOs According to the proposed rules, SEBI will ask IPO-bound companies how it arrived at the pricing. That is, the company has to justify the price it is seeking for its shares in the IPO. SEBI will seek the price of the shares sold or shares acquired in the 18 months prior to filing of the offer documents.SEBI will also seek all presentations the company has made to investors in the pre-IPO period. This will provide IPO investors with a clear view of the company’s past performance, its fund-raising rounds, the rationale put forward at those times, and whether the company has been able to achieve those projections. The regulator will seek to compare pre-IPO share-sale price(s) with the IPO price.Need for rule change With low interest rates globally, easy money, soaring equity markets and some new-age companies in the West giving phenomenal returns to investors, new-age companies in India too have been seeking sky-high valuations. SEBI, with these new proposals, is trying to make investors look at the IPO prices more realistically.Currently, traditional companies aiming to list on the stock exchanges, share with SEBI and other investors, various important ratios and earnings metrics, such as earnings per share (EPS), price-earnings ratio (PE), net asset value (NAV), and return on net worth (RONW), among others. However, such metrics do not exist for new-age companies, since they would be loss-making ones, hoping to breakeven and make a profit sometime in the long term (read, undefined future).So, for such new-age companies without the traditional metrics to fall back on, SEBI has said they should disclose their Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), which would need to be certified by statutory auditors, as well as compared with listed peers in India and overseas. Their valuations too, based on past transactions for fund-raising, would need to be disclosed to SEBI.Profitability These above rules proposed by SEBI will apply to new-age companies that have not been making a profit for the last three years preceding the IPO.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/ipo/explained-ipo-rules-for-new-age-companies-8173511.html,IPO,"Clearly, both these vaunted new-age companies have lost investor interest.While investors pay huge premiums for shares of new-age firms and are ready to wait for an extended period of time in the hope of making outsized returns when these companies turn profitable, the scenario for these companies in India has soured because of the impending US Fed tightening following rampaging inflation in the US, the possibility of easy money going out of circulation, and the Russia-Ukraine crisis.With investor wealth hugely eroded by these new-age companies, and many analysts calling out the outrageous valuations given to some of these loss-making firms, SEBI decided to bell the cat – it has proposed rules to tighten the IPO pricing of such companies.Here’s a look at the new rules proposed, and the rationale for them.SEBI will seek the price of the shares sold or shares acquired in the 18 months prior to filing of the offer documents.SEBI will also seek all presentations the company has made to investors in the pre-IPO period.","['US Fed', 'IPO']",[]

"LIC largest holder of G-secs, equities, household savings, says Report",22 February,"The IPO-bound national insurer LIC is not only the largest holder of government debt — owning 19 percent of the G-secs — but also the single largest owner of equities, the largest fund manager as well as holder of household savings, dwarfing even SBI deposits, as per a report.Holding 17 percent of the over Rs 80.7 lakh crore dated government securities, maturing by 2061, the Reserve Bank is the second-largest holder of government debt, while led by public sector banks, commercial banks collectively own around 40 percent. Other insurers cumulatively own only 5 percent.LIC's ownership of G-secs peaked in March 2019 when it held 20.6 per cent and 20.5 percent in March 2020, according to Swiss brokerage UBS Securities. With $520 billion of total assets under management (AUM), LIC is the largest institutional investor in the around $3 trillion domestic equities market.With 29 percent share or $130 billion in AUM, LIC also has the largest share of domestic institutional equity AUM, which is a shade more than half of all equity mutual funds in the country, as per an analysis by the brokerage. LIC has about 4 percent stake in equities, making it the single-largest stakeholder after the government (promoter stake), but this is down from its 2017 peak when it held 4.7 percent of the market.LIC also has a disproportionately higher share in state-owned stocks with around 9 percent share. As of December, it owns 10 percent of RIL, 5 percent each in TCS, Infosys, and ITC, and 4 percent each in ICICI Bank, L&T, and SBI.After the listing, LIC would be the largest investment in the government's portfolio of listed equities — 43 percent of $377 billion in AUM. This is important from the point of view of government budget financing through divestment and it will also be the third-largest company in terms of market cap of $172 billion after Reliance Industries ($214 billion) and TCS ($182 billion).With 28 crore policyholders, LIC has the maximum share of household savings. The report said nearly Rs 10 out of every Rs 100 saved by households each year goes to LIC, making it larger than even the perceived staple of household savings — SBI, which gets around 8 percent of the bank deposits.It will also be the 32nd-largest based on free float market cap as the government is selling only 5 percent stake through the IPO. Again RIL leads the free-float market with $108.7 billion, followed by HDFC Bank at $88.2 billion, Infosys ($84.7 billion), ICICI Bank ($72.8 billion, HDFC ($58.2 billion), and TCS ($50.8 billion). But among the state-owned companies, LIC will be the third-largest in terms of free-float value at $8.6 billion, after SBI's $27 billion and PowerGrid's $9.4 billion.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/ipo/lic-largest-holder-of-g-secs-equities-household-savings-report-8144381.html,IPO,"The IPO-bound national insurer LIC is not only the largest holder of government debt — owning 19 percent of the G-secs — but also the single largest owner of equities, the largest fund manager as well as holder of household savings, dwarfing even SBI deposits, as per a report.Holding 17 percent of the over Rs 80.7 lakh crore dated government securities, maturing by 2061, the Reserve Bank is the second-largest holder of government debt, while led by public sector banks, commercial banks collectively own around 40 percent.With $520 billion of total assets under management (AUM), LIC is the largest institutional investor in the around $3 trillion domestic equities market.With 29 percent share or $130 billion in AUM, LIC also has the largest share of domestic institutional equity AUM, which is a shade more than half of all equity mutual funds in the country, as per an analysis by the brokerage.","['IPO', 'LIC', 'Rs', 'the Reserve Bank', 'AUM', 'LIC', 'AUM', 'LIC', 'AUM']","['20.6 per cent', '$520 billion', 'around $3 trillion', '$130 billion', '$377 billion', '$172 billion', '$214 billion', '182', '$108.7 billion', '$88.2 billion', '$84.7 billion', '$72.8 billion', '$58.2 billion', '$50.8 billion', '$8.6 billion', '$27 billion', '$9.4 billion']"
"LIC IPO | 60-70 lakh PAN updated on LIC portal so far, says Chairman MR Kumar",22 February,"In what can be seen as a gauge of Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC) policyholders’ enthusiasm for its maiden public issue, its chairman MR Kumar said that over 60-70 lakh PAN (permanent account numbers) have been updated on its website so far. Completing this exercise is mandatory for participating in the IPO under the policyholders' quota.The state-owned life insurance behemoth, that is set to roll out its initial public offering (IPO) in March, is also assisting policyholders who do not have demat accounts. “A lot of interest has been generated. We have been having meetings with all our offices to help policyholders link their PAN. In the case of policyholders who do not have demat accounts, we have also requested NSDL and CDSL to help us out (as LIC cannot do it directly),” LIC chairman MR Kumar said while addressing a virtual press conference on Monday.The extent of policyholder reservation portion – the ceiling is set at 10 percent – and likely discount will be disclosed when LIC files its red herring prospectus, which is likely to happen next month. Now, only those who purchased LIC policies before February 13 (date of filing draft red herring prospectus) will be eligible for this quota. Those who haven’t linked their PAN have time until February 28 to complete the process.Also read: LIC invites its policyholders to become shareholders by updating PAN detailsImpact of change in profit-sharing arrangement An amendment to the LIC Act, 1956, last year paved the way for altering the profit-sharing arrangement between participating policyholders and shareholders (government, in this case). From getting a 95 percent share in the surpluses so far, policyholders’ share will gradually go down to 90 percent by FY25. This could potentially mean lower returns for participating policyholders.However, LIC’s management on February 21 sought to allay these concerns. “There is no shortchanging for anybody. Policyholders’ interests will be taken care of,” said Kumar. He said that the change in the ratio was brought about by the need to realign the company’s approach with that of the private players. “By FY25, we will be perfectly aligned with the private players. We need to look at it from that angle,” said KR Ashok, Chief Actuary, LIC.Moreover, this is not the only factor that determines the regular bonuses for participating policies. “When we look at bonuses, various factors are concerned. The main factor is how the corporation performs vis-à-vis what was assumed at the beginning of the year. It is difficult to single out one particular factor (change in profit-sharing) and its impact,” said KR Ashok. There is also a possibility that the bonuses could actually improve, LIC officials claimed. “Each product has a different bonus rate…also, if something more positive happens, bonuses could improve too. It all depends on how the corporation performs in relation to the (year’s) assumptions,” said Kumar.Greater focus on non-participating plansLIC is planning to place greater emphasis on non-participating products – where 100 percent of profits is allocated to shareholders - going forward. In FY21, the corporation registered a growth of 15 percent over FY19 in non-participating protection products, while new business premiums in the non-participating individual category grew 30.8 percent. Individual new business premiums in unit-linked category rose 369 percent. Annuity pension segment reported a growth of 11 percent during the same period. “This continues to be the trend in the first half of FY22. Growth is very fast in non-participating products,” said Kumar. Increase in the share of non-participating products in its product mix will help boost its (value of new business) VNB margins, which is a key valuation metric, industry experts say.Digital distribution in focus The insurance colossus will also sharpen its focus on digital distribution in the days to come. ""We have seen a 61 percent increase in digital transactions. This is also due to COVID, as more people came forward to make online premium payments. Video-based (pre-policy issuance) medical check-ups are also in place.

SoftBank-backed InMobi IPO in wait and watch mode amid market rout,23 February,"A fall in tech stocks globally has made SoftBank-backed InMobi reevaluate plans to tap public markets as it does not want to launch an IPO that will trade at a huge discount like some other new age tech stocks, its top executive told Moneycontrol.It was reported in March last year that InMobi, a provider of mobile advertising services and India’s first unicorn, was aiming for a US listing by the end of 2021, with plans to raise $1 billion at a valuation of $12-15 billion.While a lot of internet stocks listed successfully in the US and India in the last year, the sentiment has soured in the last few months, with these stocks taking a huge beating as investors turned cautious on fears of a rate hike and their lofty valuations catching up with their business fundamentals.Asked about InMobi’s listing plans in the current market, founder Naveen Tewari said, “It is hard for me to answer the question on specificity of IPO timing. It is very hard for any such decision to be made when the market has been down for the last three months.

SEBI weighs disclosure framework for loss-making companies set to go public,19 February,"National markets watchdog SEBI has proposed that loss-making new-age technology companies planning to list their shares should make disclosures about their key performance indicators considered for arriving at the basis of issue price in offer documents.Besides, such companies should make disclosures about their valuations based on issuance of new shares and acquisition of shares in the past 18 months before filing draft offer documents, according to a consultation paper.The move comes against the backdrop of many new age companies, that do not have a track record of having an operating profit at least in the preceding three years, tapping the Initial Public Offering (IPO) route to raise funds.Such firms generally remain loss-making for a longer period before achieving break-even as they opt for ways to gain scale of operations rather than profits in the initial years.The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has sought comments from the public on the consultation paper till March 5.At present, the 'Basis of Issue Price' section in an offer document covers disclosures of traditional parameters such as key accounting ratios.These include Earnings Per Share (EPS), price to earnings, return on net worth and net asset value of the company as well as comparison of such accounting ratios with its peers.According to SEBI, these parameters are typically descriptive of companies which are profit making and do not relate to a loss-making firm.These parameters may not aid investors in taking investment decisions with respect to an loss-making issuer.""It is obvious that disclosures in ’Basis of Issue Price’ section, particularly for a loss making company, are required to be supplemented with non-traditional parameters like key performance indicators and disclosure of certain additional parameters such as valuation based on past transactions/ fund raising by issuer

about the Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) that have been considered/have a bearing for arriving at the ’Basis of Issue Price’.An issuer company should disclose about relevant KPIs during the three years prior to the IPO and an explanation of how these KPIs contribute to form the 'Basis of Issue Price'.Also, an issuer company should disclose all material KPIs that have been shared with any pre-IPO investor at any point of time during the three years prior to the IPO.However, for those KPIs which the issuer company deems are not relevant for the proposed IPO, the issuer should provide adequate explanation with proper cross reference to a table disclosing the said KPIs.KPIs stated by an issuer company should be described and defined clearly, consistently and precisely and should not be misleading.Besides, all KPIs should be certified or audited by statutory auditors.In addition, SEBI has suggested that comparison of KPIs with Indian listed peer companies and/or global listed peer companies (wherever available) should be disclosed in the offer document and comparison of KPIs over time should be explained.Apart from KPIs, an issuer firm has been proposed to make disclosure of valuation of issuer company based on secondary and primary sale, in the 18 months prior to the date of filing of the DRHP/RHP.This is subject to conditions where either acquisition or sale is equal to or more than 5 per cent of the fully diluted paid-up share capital of the issue firm in a single transaction or a group of transactions in a short period of time.With reference to valuation of an

LIC IPO | 5-10% discount will make it attractive for policyholders: ithought Financial's Shyam Sekhar,17 February,"The stage is set for state-owned Life Insurance Corporation of India’s (LIC) mega initial public offering (IPO) in March. The insurance behemoth filed its draft red herring prospectus (DRHP) on February 13, preparing the ground for what is being billed as the mother of all IPOs in India. Moneycontrol's Preeti Kulkarni and Jash Kriplani spoke to Shyam Sekhar, founder of Chennai-based wealth management firm ithought Financial Consulting LLP, to find out how retail investors and policyholders should approach this investment opportunity. Edited excerpts:The DRHP for LIC’s IPO is out. What are the key takeaways from retail investors’ perspective?The LIC IPO is a big opportunity for retail investors to participate in a public issue of this scale. Bear in mind that before coming up with the public issue, LIC made some changes that are investor-friendly and should be positive for its shareholders in future. So, in that sense, LIC is well prepared for this IPO and, after this, if the company improves its performance in areas where it is weaker, then there will not be much cause for concern for shareholders. It is a very decent IPO to invest in.Could you elaborate on the changes that LIC has brought in?So far, in the case of LIC, 95 percent of the profits went to policyholders whereas private insurers shared only 90 percent. Post-IPO (by FY25), LIC will give 10 percent of the participating profits to shareholders as also the entire profit from the non-participating category. This is a big change and a very positive development for shareholders.What would you advise policyholders? There is no clarity on the discount, but what is the quantum you think would make it attractive for them?Policyholders are likely to get a reservation of up to 10 percent of the issue size. Any discount between 5-10 percent would be a good discount. They have to bear in mind that the prime beneficiaries should have demat accounts, and only in their names, not joint accounts. The important thing for policyholders is to have demat accounts that carry the same name as the one on their policy documents.What are the insurance valuation parameters that investors should track?One is the embedded value of the business, which you can compare with peers and with its own historic valuation. The other is the value of new business (VNB). This is not a business you buy on EPS and P/E ratio. That is something people must take note of because a lot of people get confused with the EPS and P/E ratios. The multiple is usually on the embedded value of the business.Also read: LIC’s tie-up with Policybazaar: Will it manage to attract millennial customers?What is LIC’s valuation multiple likely to be?Around 2.5 times is a reasonable valuation, provided that the business grows and new business is generated at a faster rate. If the company is able to increase its business in non-participating policies at a faster rate, then we should see these valuations sustain.We had seen in recent issues that after the anchor book lock-in period is over, there is a large-scale selling. Do you think this could be a possibility even in LIC?Large shareholder selling is a risk in every IPO. But, between the date of issue and the date of listing, not much is going to change in the market perception of LIC, because this is a well-discovered company. It’s a company with a long history. All the negatives are well-known to us, even before the IPO. So, why would somebody buy an IPO at let's say two-and-a-half times the embedded value and then try to sell it after the IPO at a lower valuation.LIC is seen as an institution that is used by the government to bail itself out from tight situations. Is there also a perception risk?The value of the investments LIC holds today, which has been disclosed, is reflected in the embedded value. So, all the past decisions of the government are already kind of factored in. What we need to see is the quality of the corporate governance the board will uphold in the future. So, the corporate governance standards of LIC will be as good as any other PSU in the future. And it will naturally be compared with its private sector peers.Large shareholder selling is a risk in every IPO.There is certainly going to be pressure on the board to live up to what the market expects. What happened in the past was as an enterprise or corporation of the government. What should happen going forward should be as a competing, listed market enterprise with multiple stakeholders. These stakeholders’ interest is something that cannot be compromised.LIC controls over 60 percent of the market (in terms of new business premiums), but its share has been slipping steadily. Will this impact the future performance of LIC’s stock?LIC needs to become more efficient. It needs to be stronger in segments where it is now under-represented, like non-participating products, and it should have a better client mix, better product mix and a better market presence. All three things will have to happen. This is just the starting point of what the company needs to do to sustain its valuations and grow its valuations. If the company does all these things right, then it probably can be a big success story. But it needs to get its act together on these aspects. Investors should not worry too much about market share; see how the business is run, how risks are taken, cost of acquiring customers and VNB margins.Will better market share in non-participating products and protection products improve VNB margins?If LIC’s share in non-participating products increases, it should improve VNB margins. The base is low and the opportunity is large. With these improvements, when it comes on par with private players, the company should be able to compete far more aggressively.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/personal-finance/lic-ipo-5-10-discount-will-make-it-attractive-for-policyholders-ithought-financials-shyam-sekhar-8117671.html,IPO,"The important thing for policyholders is to have demat accounts that carry the same name as the one on their policy documents.What are the insurance valuation parameters that investors should track?One is the embedded value of the business, which you can compare with peers and with its own historic valuation.The multiple is usually on the embedded value of the business.Also read: LIC’s tie-up with Policybazaar: Will it manage to attract millennial customers?What is LIC’s valuation multiple likely to be?Around 2.5 times is a reasonable valuation, provided that the business grows and new business is generated at a faster rate.",['LIC'],[]
"LIC IPO may come at discount to listed peers, says UBS Securities",16 February,"Investors may value shares of Life Insurance Corporation of India at a discount to its listed peers, said UBS Securities India in a note.Currently, listed peers of LIC trade at 2-3.3 times their one-year forward embedded value. UBS is of the view that discount to private players is owing to LIC's traditionally savings-heavy business mix, lower operating leverage, heavier dependency on the agency channel, and its status as a state-owned enterprise.LIC on February 13 filed its much-awaited draft red herring prospectus with the Securities and Exchange Board of India. As part of the IPO, the government is looking to sell around 5 percent stake in the life insurance giant.A Moneycontrol analysis showed that the government could raise anywhere between Rs 53,000 crore to Rs 94,000 crore from the IPO, which will help it meet its revised disinvestment target of Rs 78,000 crore for the current fiscal year.Market rumors have suggested that the IPO could be priced at Rs 2,000-2,100 per share, which will take LIC’s market capitalization to Rs 13.3 lakh crore. At that valuation, LIC will trade at 2.5 times the reported embedded value.The life insurance behemoth has set its embedded value at Rs 5.4 lakh crore, which UBS Securities said is down to shareholder’s interest in non-participation funds increasing to 100 percent. “On a like-to-like basis without a change in distribution profits, EV would have been Rs 1.25 lakh crore, the brokerage firm said.UBS Securities expects the listing of LIC to have positive externalities for the life insurance industry as it might lead to a higher awareness that will benefit private companies as well. That said, the brokerage firm does not expect LIC to improve the share of protection products in its product mix anytime soon given its ethos on being a savings instrument for Indians.“We believe the potential issue could bring transparency to LIC's operations and increase rationality in its business decisions,” UBS Securities said.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

"Vedant Fashions' listing defies pessimism, what should investors do now?",16 February,"Vedant Fashion, owner of men’s celebration wear brand Manyavar, defied pessimism on the Street after it listed at a premium of 8 percent to its issue price at Rs 931 per share on the National Stock Exchange on February 16.Ahead of its market debut, several analysts had suggested that Vedant Fashion could list at a discount given its perceived expensive valuations and the relatively muted response of investors to the initial public offering.“The valuation of Vedant Fashions looks expensive and investors will not have much space.

"Moneycontrol Pro Panorama | LIC IPO takes shape, buzz on valuation grows",14 February,"Dear Reader,The Panorama newsletter is sent to Moneycontrol Pro subscribers on market days. It offers easy access to stories published on Moneycontrol Pro and gives a little extra by setting out a context or an event or trend that investors should keep track of.It’s finally here. The Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC) has filed its share sale prospectus. It plans to sell 316.25 million shares, about 5 percent of its total equity base of 6.32 billion shares.The question on everybody’s lips: what will be the size of the IPO and its price?Private sector listed rivals such as HDFC Life Insurance are currently valued between 3-4 times their embedded value (EV). This is the sum of the present value of all future profits and net worth. For LIC, this EV is Rs 5.4 lakh crore.At twice the embedded value, LIC’s market capitalisation would be Rs 10.7 lakh crore and the size of the IPO Rs 53,500 crore. At 3.5 times, the respective numbers would be Rs 18.7 lakh crore and Rs 93,625 crore. So, no doubts here. It will be India’s largest share sale dwarfing the Rs 18,300 crore raised by Patym’s owner, One 97 Communications Ltd.However, big is not always better or beautiful. LIC will suffer from the same handicaps as other state-owned enterprises such as government meddling, outdated systems and processes, and slow technology adoption. Besides, there are certain specific factors (hint: VNB margins, commission ratios and product mix) as well. To know more, read our research note on why LIC will be valued at a discount to these private sector players.Even this valuation has come about because tweaking its profit distribution policy will favour shareholders. This had the effect of blowing up its EV, and hence its valuation, by more than five times in six months, a feat that start-ups would be proud to emulate.Policyholders may feel aggrieved at this change which leaves them with a much lower share of LIC’s profits. For now, they will have to satisfy themselves with a discount on the IPO price should they wish to bid. The insurer has also reserved 10 percent of the offer size for policyholders.At the lower end of the range too, we are looking at an IPO that aims to raise Rs 54,000 crore from the market. Do investors have this much appetite and what will be the impact on the secondary markets?My colleague Neha Dave pointed out earlier this month that in 2021, 27 IPOs saw total subscriptions (including oversubscription) of at least Rs 50,000 crore.But much will depend on how much liquidity will be withdrawn from the market when this blue whale of an issue drops into the pool. Fund managers would find it hard to exclude a company which will be among India’s three largest listed firms from their portfolios. Even if the issue is a couple of times oversubscribed, we are talking of Rs 150,000 crore leaving the market, albeit temporarily. That could cause a few tremors, especially at a time when foreign investors are unenthusiastic about emerging markets, with the US Federal Reserve set to hike rates. The fall in the markets today, with the Nifty down by 3.04 percent at 3.07 pm, is a reminder of weakening market sentiment.We will get more clarity closer to the time of the issue which could hit the markets in about three weeks, going by the hints dropped by the disinvestment secretary.

HC rejects Zostel's plea for 7% stake in OYO,14 February,"The Delhi High Court has rejected Zostel's plea claiming 7 percent shareholding in OYO ahead of the latter's initial public offering (IPO) in what appears to be a big relief for Softbank-backed hospitality firm.A single-judge bench of the Delhi High Court comprising Justice C Hari Shankar passed the ruling today.Zo Rooms which has been fighting a legal battle with Oyo had filed an appeal in the High Court seeking protection of its rights against the company last year.On account of this shareholding dispute, Zostel was seeking to restrain Oyo from proceeding with its IPO process.

The deal never took place, fuelling a bitter war between the two parties.Oyo backed off from the deal talks citing liabilities of Zo Rooms. It claims that it had identified several issues during the due diligence process, where significant liabilities and unpaid dues, as well as undisclosed contingent liabilities came to the fore.Oyo is awaiting for SEBI's nod to go ahead with its proposed $1.2 billion IPO.  Reports suggest that the company may recosider its $9 valuation considering the choppy market sentiments right now.In the last couple of months, stocks of loss-making internet companies have seen intense selling pressure in India and the US as investors turn cautious.Shares of restaurant aggregator Zomato plunged to its lowest level since its blockbuster listing last year, with digital payments company Paytm, online beauty and wellness firm Nykaa and PB Fintech, an online insurance and lending platform, also coming under pressure.Oyo filed its draft red herring prospectus (DRHP) in September last year and has been in the process of responding to questions and clarifications sought by regulators.Meanwhile Zo Rooms legal counsel said the company was evaluating if it could file an apeal in the division bench.“We are awaiting receipt of the complete judgment to go through the same to ascertain the reasons on the basis of which we have been denied the interim relief.

"LIC IPO | LIC issue size could range from Rs 53,500 crore to Rs 93,625 crore; issue price may be Rs 1,693-2,962 per share",16 February,"A simple arithmetic pegs LIC’s issue size at upwards of Rs 50,000 crore with a per share value in the range of Rs 1,600 to Rs 2,900.Here is how the math flows. LIC’s embedded value as on September 30, 2021 has been estimated at 5.39 lakh crore. Currently, private insurance companies trade at a multiple of 3-4 times embedded value.However, embedded value is only an estimation of value based on several assumptions and the multiple attributed to an insurer could vary based on several qualitative factors.Considering its size, and dominant position in the market with 66 percent market share in new business premium, its growth rate may not match up to some of the nimble footed private insurers.A range of embedded value multiple between 2-3.5 throws up a valuation for the corporation ranging from Rs 10.7 lakh crore to Rs 18.7 lakh crore. Based on the total equity capital of 632 crore share, the issue size for a 5% offer for sale works out to Rs 53,500 crore to Rs 93,625 crore.The per share price thus works out to Rs 1693 to Rs 2962. Against this, the government’s average cost of acquisition of shares stood at Rs 0.16 as LIC went through a capital rejig ahead of the IPO.LIC’s initial capital, when it was incorporated, was Rs 100 crore. Since LIC was a collective, and not envisaged as a public limited company, there were no shares allotted. To transform the corporation into a corporate structure with shareholders ahead of the public issue, the original capital of Rs 100 crore infused by the government during the inception of the corporation was converted into share capital by allotting shares of face value Rs 10 for an equivalent amount.In September 2021, the corporation then allotted an additional 62.24 crore equity shares at the same face value against the free reserves outstanding in LIC's book as on March 31, 2020.Then again, another 560 crore equity shares of the same face value was allotted against the retained share of surplus of the government of India for fiscal years 2020 and 2021. LIC’s total capital now stands at Rs 6,324 crore.LIC’s valuation at 2.5 times embedded value corroborates with the government’s pared down target for disinvestments for FY22. This appears to be in line with what big institutional investors may be willing to pay for a company that will continue to be pre-dominantly owned by the government. The government revised its disinvestment target for the current fiscal to Rs 78,000 crore, of which Rs 12,000-odd has been garnered so far during the fiscal.Besides, the muted expectations on the valuation LIC and the proposed issue size has to be viewed in the light of the current state of market where foreign investors have been continuously selling. A large issue size only means more selling from domestic mutual funds that would want to sell down existing position to make room for allocation to LIC, fuelling additional volatility in the market.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/ipo/lic-ipo-issue-size-could-range-from-rs-10-7-18-7-lakh-crore-issue-price-may-be-rs-1693-2962-per-share-8087611.html,IPO,"Currently, private insurance companies trade at a multiple of 3-4 times embedded value.However, embedded value is only an estimation of value based on several assumptions and the multiple attributed to an insurer could vary based on several qualitative factors.Considering its size, and dominant position in the market with 66 percent market share in new business premium, its growth rate may not match up to some of the nimble footed private insurers.A range of embedded value multiple between 2-3.5 throws up a valuation for the corporation ranging from Rs 10.7 lakh crore to Rs 18.7 lakh crore.To transform the corporation into a corporate structure with shareholders ahead of the public issue, the original capital of Rs 100 crore infused by the government during the inception of the corporation was converted into share capital by allotting shares of face value Rs 10 for an equivalent amount.In September 2021, the corporation then allotted an additional 62.24 crore equity shares at the same face value against the free reserves outstanding in LIC's book as on March 31, 2020.Then again, another 560 crore equity shares of the same face value was allotted against the retained share of surplus of the government of India for fiscal years 2020 and 2021.",['LIC'],[]
LIC IPO | Draft papers highlight hike in mortality reserves to meet COVID claims in FY21,14 February,"The COVID-19 pandemic had put to test the resilience of life insurers in India and the largest insurer was no exception. Just like its private peers, Life Insurance Corporation (LIC) of India had to significantly beef up its mortality reserve in FY21 and thereafter to deal with a spurt in claims.The government has filed a draft prospectus with the capital markets regulator for LIC's initial public offer through which it aims to sell at least 5 percent stake in the life insurer.LIC created a mortality reserve of Rs 7,419.5 crore for the six months ended September over and above Rs 2,344.5 crore was set aside in FY21, according to the draft red herring prospectus. The total death claims benefits paid out by the insurer during the six months ended September 2021 were Rs 21,734 crore, almost 90 percent of the benefits paid in the whole of FY21.“We will continue to review this mortality reserve as the pandemic evolves. Currently, we believe the mortality loading in premium rates is adequate for the long term due to the expected duration of the pandemic,” the company said in its prospectus.Life insurance companies set aside funds earmarked as mortality reserve to meet an increase in death claims.The most valuable listed private life insurer HDFC Life had beefed up its mortality reserve by Rs 700 crore during the September quarter to meet a rise in claims due to COVID-19. For the insurer, peak mortality claims were 3-4 times that of the second quarter of FY20, it had said in its results briefing. The largest private life insurer SBI Life Insurance had also increased its mortality reserve.Notwithstanding an increase in claims, insurance companies have managed to settle a high ratio of these. LIC’s claim settlement ratio was the third best when compared with the top five private sector life insurers. The ratio was 94.2 percent for first half of FY22. This compared with 98 percent for HDFC Life Insurance Co, while SBI Life had a lower settlement ratio of 86.1 percent. Claims settlement ratio plays a big part in individuals opting for an insurance company.Yet another way that the pandemic hit LIC was through reinsurance. The reinsurance ceded for claims paid was Rs 422.1 crore in the first half of the current financial year, nearly 90 percent of the amount for the whole of FY21. As such, reinsurance ceded for claims paid in FY21 was more than double that of the previous year.In its prospectus, LIC has cautioned that it is vulnerable to concentration risks with reinsurers given few players.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/companies/lic-ipo-drat-papers-highlight-hike-in-mortality-reserves-to-meet-covid-claims-in-fy21-8087281.html,IPO,"Just like its private peers, Life Insurance Corporation (LIC) of India had to significantly beef up its mortality reserve in FY21 and thereafter to deal with a spurt in claims.The government has filed a draft prospectus with the capital markets regulator for LIC's initial public offer through which it aims to sell at least 5 percent stake in the life insurer.LIC created a mortality reserve of Rs 7,419.5 crore for the six months ended September over and above Rs 2,344.5 crore was set aside in FY21, according to the draft red herring prospectus.Currently, we believe the mortality loading in premium rates is adequate for the long term due to the expected duration of the pandemic,” the company said in its prospectus.Life insurance companies set aside funds earmarked as mortality reserve to meet an increase in death claims.The most valuable listed private life insurer HDFC Life had beefed up its mortality reserve by Rs 700 crore during the September quarter to meet a rise in claims due to COVID-19.","['Life Insurance Corporation', 'LIC', 'LIC', 'LIC', 'HDFC Life', 'COVID-19']",[]

LIC IPO: Here are the risk factors to consider before investing in India's largest IPO,13 February,"The wheels have been set in motion for what is expected to be the largest Initial Public Offering (IPO) in India. The government has filed the draft red herring prospectus (DRHP) for the IPO of the state-owned Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC).As per the DRHP, the IPO consists of an offer for sale (OFS) of up to 316.25 million shares by the government of India. LIC has the largest share in India’s life insurance market at 64.1 percent in terms of premium and 66.2 percent share in terms of New Business Premiums.The 65-year-old insurer’s divestment includes a reservation of 10 percent of the issue size for citizens who are policyholders.In the DRHP, LIC has said that the company faces risks from the impact on business from the ongoing pandemic, interest rate fluctuations, legal proceedings against the company, related party transactions, further investments that may be required in IDBI Bank, and other external factors.SIGNIFICANT GOVERNMENT INFLUENCEThe Government of India (GoI) holds a majority stake in LIC and will continue to be the promoter even after offloading a part of its stake in the IPO. The DRHP highlights that this will allow the government to exercise significant influence over the corporation.As per the LIC Act, GoI's shareholding cannot fall below 51 percent at any point. Due to this, the DRHP said, ""Our Corporation may be required to take certain actions in furtherance of the GoI’s economic or policy objectives. There can be no assurance that such actions would necessarily be beneficial to our Corporation.""It further said that the government's interests may be in conflict with the interests of other shareholders. The promoter (government) may or may not resolve any conflicts of interest in favour of LIC or other shareholders, to the extent that the shareholders may also be disadvantaged by any action the government may pursue, it said.RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONSLIC, as per the DRHP, has entered into related party transactions worth Rs 43,585 crore in FY19, Rs 21,404 crore in FY20, Rs 25,172 crore in FY21 and worth Rs 17,075 crore in the six months ended September 2021.These related party transactions accounted for 7.64 percent, 3.32 percent, 3.58 percent and 5.07 percent, respectively, of the company’s total income.The DRHP read, “While we believe that all such transactions have been conducted on an arm’s length basis, we cannot assure you that we could not have achieved more favourable terms had such transactions been entered into with unrelated parties.”The insurer clarified that it will enter into related party transactions in the future as well, some of which may include conflicts of interest. The DRHP further said that there can be no assurance that related party transactions, individually or in the aggregate, will not have an adverse effect on the business and results of operations.POSSIBILITY OF FURTHER FUND INFUSION IN IDBI BANKIn 2019, the government bailed out IDBI Bank by allowing the LIC of India to own 51 percent stake in the bank. LIC infused Rs 4743 crore into IDBI Bank using policyholders’ funds.At this point LIC does not believe that IDBI Bank will require further fund infusion, more so since the bank has come out of the prompt corrective action framework since March 10, 2021.The DRHP further added, “However, if IDBI Bank requires additional capital prior to the expiry of the applicable five-year period and it is unable to raise capital, we would be required to infuse additional funds into IDBI Bank, which may have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.”NON-ADHERENCE TO SEBI NORMSAs per SEBI norms, no company can hold more than 10 percent of shareholding or voting rights in more than one asset management company. LIC owns 45 percent in LIC Mutual Fund Asset Management Limited and directly owns 49.00 percent of the outstanding shares in LICMF Trustee.Besides that, the corporation also holds 51 percent stake in IDBI Bank, which in turn holds 66.67 percent of the issued and paid-up capital of IDBI Asset Management Limited. This may bring LIC under SEBI’s lens for breaching regulations.Due to this, the corporation is subject to further penalty, strictures or any other sanctions prescribed under the applicable laws.DEPENDENCE ON AGENTSLIC’s policy distribution depends on its vast network of agents with 94.78 percent of new business premiums being procured by the agents in FY21. however, the company has warned that attrition is high and it terminated services of over two lakh agents, which equals 16.59 percent of its individual agent network in FY21.In the six months of FY22 ended September 31, 2021, the company had already terminated services of over 1.34 lakh agents which represents 9.20 percent of the network.“We may need to increase commission and other benefits in order to attract and retain enough agents, subject to the cap on commission payable to our agents,” the DRHP read.However, ahead of the IPO, LIC has tied up with insurance marketplace Policybazaar in a first-of-its-kind move to make its policy available through online channels as well.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/ipo/lic-ipo-here-are-the-risk-factors-to-consider-before-investing-in-indias-largest-ipo-8087141.html,IPO,"LIC has the largest share in India’s life insurance market at 64.1 percent in terms of premium and 66.2 percent share in terms of New Business Premiums.The 65-year-old insurer’s divestment includes a reservation of 10 percent of the issue size for citizens who are policyholders.In the DRHP, LIC has said that the company faces risks from the impact on business from the ongoing pandemic, interest rate fluctuations, legal proceedings against the company, related party transactions, further investments that may be required in IDBI Bank, and other external factors.SIGNIFICANT GOVERNMENT INFLUENCEThe Government of India (GoI) holds a majority stake in LIC and will continue to be the promoter even after offloading a part of its stake in the IPO.The promoter (government) may or may not resolve any conflicts of interest in favour of LIC or other shareholders, to the extent that the shareholders may also be disadvantaged by any action the government may pursue, it said.RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONSLIC, as per the DRHP, has entered into related party transactions worth Rs 43,585 crore in FY19, Rs 21,404 crore in FY20, Rs 25,172 crore in FY21 and worth Rs 17,075 crore in the six months ended September 2021.These related party transactions accounted for 7.64 percent, 3.32 percent, 3.58 percent and 5.07 percent, respectively, of the company’s total income.The DRHP read, “While we believe that all such transactions have been conducted on an arm’s length basis, we cannot assure you that we could not have achieved more favourable terms had such transactions been entered into with unrelated parties.”The insurer clarified that it will enter into related party transactions in the future as well, some of which may include conflicts of interest.","['LIC', 'New Business Premiums', 'LIC', 'IDBI Bank', 'Government of India', 'GoI', 'LIC', 'LIC']",[]

"India will see the highest new demat account openings ahead of LIC IPO, says Zerodha's Nithin Kamath",11 February,"The upcoming LIC IPO will bring the greatest number of new investors to the stock markets, says stockbroking and trading platform Zerodha’s co-founder and CEO Nithin Kamath.India awaits the details of the country’s largest ever initial public offering (IPO) by the Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC).“We have been looking forward to this for the past two years…and whichever month the IPO happens in, I think India will see the largest month in terms of new account openings for capital markets for sure,” Kamath said.Kamath was speaking at Niti Aayog’s Fintech Open Month on a panel with Razorpay co-founder and CEO Harshil Mathur and PwC’s Partner and India lead for fintech, Vivek Belgavi.The LIC IPO comes at a time when the stock markets have been choppy, but also following the immense interest seen from first time retail investors during IPOs over the past year.“The flip side here is that markets have been in a spot over the last few weeks. IPOs are also about luck depending on whether it’s a good or a bad period. The retail appetite will be interesting to see because there is a fear creeping in about how the markets will hold up,” he added.Zerodha has over eight million customers and has benefited from the huge interest shown by Indians in stock market investing post the pandemic.The LIC IPO follows listings by fintech players seen in the past few months, namely PB Fintech and Paytm. Ahead of the IPO, LIC also tied up with Policybazaar to make its policies available on the online insurance marketplace.This was a first of its kind move for LIC which has always been dependent on its network of 1.3 million agents to disseminate policies. According to Razorpay’s Mathur, this is a positive sign for fintech players and may signal more collaboration with fintechs in the future.“It is a very different kind of an IPO, there is no one in the country who has not heard of LIC. LIC’s tie-up with Policybazaar shows that they are opening up to digitization and the fintech ecosystem in general. So if the IPO goes well they may do more (collaborations) in the insurtech space,” he said.The insurtech space is made up of insurance broking platforms such as Policybazaar, Paytm, Coverfox and digital general insurance companies, including Acko and Digit. Platforms such as Policybazaar and Turtlemint also help consumers compare policies before choosing the right fit.What is drawing users to these companies is their focus on simplifying processes after studying the challenges faced by customers while buying insurance.PwC’s Belgavi too feels that a successful IPO of India’s largest life insurance player can have a positive impact on the insurtech space.“Right now LIC is using them (Policybazaar) as a channel. But later as they start allowing insurtech players to co-create products, it can really change the face of insurtech,” Belgavi said.He added that with over 1.3 million agents and 80 million customers, the number of people aware of the IPO is large and this may mean larger participation in the IPO.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/india-will-see-the-highest-new-demat-account-openings-ahead-of-lic-ipo-says-zerodhas-nithin-kamath-8073891.html,IPO,"The upcoming LIC IPO will bring the greatest number of new investors to the stock markets, says stockbroking and trading platform Zerodha’s co-founder and CEO Nithin Kamath.India awaits the details of the country’s largest ever initial public offering (IPO) by the Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC).“We have been looking forward to this for the past two years…and whichever month the IPO happens in, I think India will see the largest month in terms of new account openings for capital markets for sure,” Kamath said.Kamath was speaking at Niti Aayog’s Fintech Open Month on a panel with Razorpay co-founder and CEO Harshil Mathur and PwC’s Partner and India lead for fintech, Vivek Belgavi.The LIC IPO comes at a time when the stock markets have been choppy, but also following the immense interest seen from first time retail investors during IPOs over the past year.“The flip side here is that markets have been in a spot over the last few weeks.The retail appetite will be interesting to see because there is a fear creeping in about how the markets will hold up,” he added.Zerodha has over eight million customers and has benefited from the huge interest shown by Indians in stock market investing post the pandemic.The LIC IPO follows listings by fintech players seen in the past few months, namely PB Fintech and Paytm.","['IPO', 'Zerodha', 'IPO', 'the Life Insurance Corporation of India', 'IPO', 'Niti Aayog’s Fintech', 'IPO', 'Zerodha', 'LIC', 'IPO', 'PB Fintech']",[]

It reminds us of the food delivery category a few years ago when many platforms competed over a large and growing market but ultimately only the few who delivered exceptional experience to their customers survived,"" Deepinder Goyal, founder and chief executive of Zomato said in a statement.""We are becoming increasingly confident in our decision to invest behind market leadership here with healthy unit economics. As a result, we are updating the upper bound of our potential investments in this category to $400m cash over the next two years,"" he added.The company made an investment of $225 million last year across Blinkit (erstwhile Grofers), Shiprocket and Magicpin.It must be noted that Zomato was also in talks with Blinkit's younger rival Zepto for an acquisition last year.

The food-tech had offered Zepto a valuation of $1 billion.Along with Zomato, rival Swiggy was also looking to acquire Zepto.

In December Grofers also pulled services from select pincodes where 10 minutes delivery wasn't working out. However, the company did not mention if it was reopeneing any of those pincodes.Quick commerce, which is defined as the delivery of items under 45 minutes, is the new battlefield as players look to outdo each other by reducing delivery time of essentials to minutes.

"Facing regulatory roadblocks, SoftBank drops sale of Arm to Nvidia, will seek IPO",08 February,"SoftBank Group Corp shelved the sale of Arm Ltd to US chipmaker Nvidia Corp due to regulatory hurdles, the companies said, and Arm named a new CEO who it said would help the British firm seek a public listing before March 2023.The cash-and-stock deal was announced in 2020 and would have been worth as much as $80 billion. But the US Federal Trade Commission sued to block it in December, arguing that competition in the nascent markets for chips in self-driving cars and a new category of networking chips could be hurt if Nvidia carried out the purchase.The buyout also faced scrutiny in Britain and the European Union amid concerns that it could push up prices and reduce choice and innovation. It had yet to receive approval in China, which has previously withheld approval of cross-border chip acquisitions.The sale would have marked an early exit from Arm for SoftBank, which acquired it for $32 billion, and the collapse of the deal marks a major setback to the Japanese conglomerate's efforts to generate funds at time when valuations across its portfolio are under pressure.Arm said in a separate statement that had appointed Rene Haas as its chief executive officer and member of the board, effective immediately. A chip industry veteran, Haas joined Arm in 2013 and before that worked seven years at Nvidia.""Rene is the right leader to accelerate Arm's growth as the company looks to re-enter the public markets,"" SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son said in the statement from Arm.SoftBank said that Arm's net sales surged 40% to $2 billion in the nine months to December from the year-ago period.An Arm acquisition would have put Nvidia into even more intense competition with rivals in the data center chip market such as Intel and Advanced Micro Devices Inc.Arm licenses its architecture and technology to customers such as Qualcomm Inc, Apple and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd that design chips for devices from mobile phones to computers.Nvidia has become the most valuable US chip company on the strength of its graphic processor chips. Although still seen as crucial for gaming, graphic processors have become much more widely used for artificial intelligence and other advanced fields.The value of the deal, which depended on Nvidia's stock price, was originally pegged at about $40 billion and rose with Nvidia's stock price to as $80 billion late last year, though the California company's stock has fallen since.Nvidia said in a statement that it would retain its 20-year Arm license.The Financial Times was the first to report https://on.ft.com/3HyXBWA that SoftBank's Arm-Nvidia deal had collapsed.

LIC IPO: Market cap of India’s biggest insurer likely to hit $293 billion after listing,14 February,"The market capitalisation of Life Insurance Corporation of India has the potential to reach as high as $293 billion or Rs 22.1 lakh crore after its listing if the current valuation multiples of listed life insurance players in India are any indicator.At such a valuation, LIC will become the second-largest listed insurance provider and the largest life insurer globally. Further, its market capitalisation will be the largest in India.The life insurance major's draft red herring prospectus showed that its India embedded value has been pegged at Rs 5.4 lakh crore.LIC IPO's actual valuation cannot be determined yet given that the company has not yet determined its price band. However, the draft papers showed that the government will offer around 316 million shares or 5 percent stake in the life insurer to the public.The Securities and Exchange Board of India's February 2021 tweak of IPO rules allows large companies to sell less than 10 percent of their stake through a public issue as long minimum public holding went up to 10 percent within two years and to 25 percent in five years of listing.That said, the revised estimate for disinvestment proceeds in the Budget 2022-23 has been pegged at Rs 78,000 crore for 2021-22. The government has so far raised around Rs 12,000 crore, implying that it will make up the deficit of Rs 66,000 crore from the stake sale in LIC.If indeed the government aims to raise Rs 66,000 crore via a 5 percent stake sale in the IPO that will put the IPO-bound company's market capitalisation at roughly Rs 13.2 lakh crore.“LIC IPO plans are going fine. It should happen this year itself. Money from LIC IPO will come this year itself,” Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman had told Network 18 in an exclusive interview on February 2.Currently, HDFC Life Insurance trades at 4.1 times P/EV based on its estimated embedded value for the current financial year. Similarly, SBI Life Insurance trades at 3 times P/EV and ICICI Prudential Life Insurance is available at 2.6 P/EV.At current valuation multiples of listed peers, LIC’s market capitalization could be in the range of Rs 14.03 lakh crore to Rs 22.12 lakh crore. The valuation will put LIC ahead of global peers like China’s Ping An Insurance and China Life Insurance, Hong Kong-listed AIA Group and US-listed Metlife, who are valued at $57 billion to $149 billion.“Ideally, LIC should get a premium over all the listed players,” said Amit Kumar Gupta, a portfolio adviser at Adroit Financial Services.LIC’s likely premium to currently listed players will be based on its dominant position in India’s life insurance market with a more than 65 percent market share and the overall growth potential of India’s life insurance space.The life insurer’s latest move to expand its online footprint through tie-up with PolicyBazaar will further enhance its ability to prize away market share from peers.If the government does bring LIC to the public market at valuation of close to Rs 13.2 lakh crore, it would suggest that it is leaving considerable value on the table for investors.“Somebody may have suggested them to sell around 5 percent and let the market decide the valuation and then sell some stake every year,” Gupta said.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

Zomato's Deepinder Goyal sells personal stake in Blinkit to Tiger Global,03 February,"Zomato founder and chief executive Deepinder Goyal has sold his personal stake in online grocery delivery firm Blinkit to New York-based hedge fund Tiger Global.The move comes at a time when Blinkit looks to raise $500 million from the food delivery start-up.It was first reported by Deal Street Asia, quoting Tiger Global's filing with Singapore's Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority.As per the report, Goyal's first investment in Blinkit was made in 2015 and assuming share price of Blinkit's last fundraise of $67.48, Goyal is expected to have made $2.86 million through this deal.The deal happened over six months after Zomato signed up to invest $120 million in Blinkit (then Grofers) along with Tiger Global at a valuation of over a billion dollars.This was just ahead of Zomato's stellar public listing where it raised $1.25 billion comprising a fresh issue of equity shares worth Rs 9,000 crore and an offer-for-sale (OFS) worth Rs 375 crore by existing investor Info Edge.This is the latest in a series of such moves. In December, Goyal also clarified that he had exited Shiprocket with ""zero profit"" before Zomato could invest in the logistics aggregator. Goyal had invested in Shiprocket earlier during the same year.Last month too, Zomato invested in an ad tech firm Adonmo Pvt Ltd. In a disclosure to the stock exchange, Zomato said that early stage investment firm Bace Fund LP in which Goyal had an investment, was an existing investor in Adonmo. With an aim to clarify the positioning, the company said that Goyal's investment in the Bace Fund LP was of $1000,000 which was an ""insignificant portion of the fund.""Zomato has set aside $1 billion to deploy across startups  over the next 1-2 years, with a major focus on the quick commerce space.Besides investing $15 million in Adonmo, Zomato has invested $5 million in B2B software platform UrbanPiper Technology, $75 million in logistics aggregator Shiprocket, $50 million in Magicpin and $50 million in Curefit.The company owns 9.3% of Blinkit where it invested $100 million. However, this deal was signed before the company got listed and announced its $1 billion war chest to invest in other startups.Blinkit , which offers 10-minutes grocery delivery to customers, has set up 300 partner stores across the country through founder and CEO Albinder Dhindsa said in a blog on December 23. This happened soon after the company decided to pull the plugs in areas it wasn't able to deliver groceries in 10 minutes.Quick commerce, which is defined as the delivery of items under 45 minutes, is the new battlefield as players look to outdo each other by reducing delivery time of essentials to minutes.

"FDI policy to be tweaked soon to pave way for LIC public issue, says  DPIIT secretary",03 February,"The government will approve and notify the necessary changes in India's Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) policy to allow the disinvestment in the state-run insurer Life Insurance Corporation (LIC).""Interministerial consultations are in the last phases. Things should happen very soon,"" Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade Secretary Anurag Jain said. He hinted that the Cabinet would be approached for approval soon.This coincided with Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman telling Network18 in an interview that the details of the policy would be announced soon, while the money from the IPO would come in FY22 itself.On February 1, Department of Investment and Public Asset Management Secretary Tuhin Kanta had stated that the life insurer was likely to file draft IPO papers within two weeks.The DPIIT is working with the Department of Financial Services (DFS) and Department of Investment and Public Asset Management (DIPAM), under the Finance Ministry. Jain said that he expected things to forward smoothly on the issue and all ministerial clearances to be given soon, as the issue had not seen any difference in stance among the ministries.Big numbers involvedThe Reserve Bank of India defines FDI as purchase of a stake in a listed company that’s 10 percent or larger by an individual or entity based abroad, or any foreign investment in an unlisted firm. The clearance for FDI in LIC will not just allow global funds to participate in the IPO but will also open doors for a significant stake purchase after the listing.Currently, FDI of up to 74 percent is permitted in most Indian insurers. However, the rules don’t apply to LIC because it is a special entity created and administered by a separate act of parliament, namely the LIC Act.As per rules of the Securities and Exchange Board of India, both FPI and FDI are permitted under public offer. However, since the LIC Act has no provision for foreign investments, there is a need to align the proposed LIC IPO with Sebi norms regarding foreign investor participation.The much-awaited IPO of the life insurance behemoth is expected to be one of the biggest in the country, with the government aiming to raise close to $12 billion by selling a minority stake to the public.The government has revised the disinvestment target for the current fiscal year to Rs 78,000 crore from the Budget estimate of Rs 1.75 lakh crore. With the government already pocketing more than Rs 24,000 crore so far from disinvestment, the proceeds from LIC's IPO are likely to be a little more than Rs 50,000 crore.LIC is the largest asset manager in India with Rs 36.7 trillion Assets Under Management (AUM). LIC's AUM on a standalone basis were equal to 18 percent of India's GDP for FY21. It has been providing life insurance services in India for more than 65 years and is the largest life insurer in the country with a market share of 64.1 percent.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/economy/change-in-fdi-policy-soon-to-allow-lic-ipo-dpiit-secretary-8027961.html,IPO,"He hinted that the Cabinet would be approached for approval soon.This coincided with Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman telling Network18 in an interview that the details of the policy would be announced soon, while the money from the IPO would come in FY22 itself.On February 1, Department of Investment and Public Asset Management Secretary Tuhin Kanta had stated that the life insurer was likely to file draft IPO papers within two weeks.The DPIIT is working with the Department of Financial Services (DFS) and Department of Investment and Public Asset Management (DIPAM), under the Finance Ministry.However, since the LIC Act has no provision for foreign investments, there is a need to align the proposed LIC IPO with Sebi norms regarding foreign investor participation.The much-awaited IPO of the life insurance behemoth is expected to be one of the biggest in the country, with the government aiming to raise close to $12 billion by selling a minority stake to the public.The government has revised the disinvestment target for the current fiscal year to Rs 78,000 crore from the Budget estimate of Rs 1.75 lakh crore.","['Cabinet', 'Finance', 'IPO', 'Department of Investment and Public Asset Management', 'IPO', 'DPIIT', 'the Department of Financial Services', 'Department of Investment and Public Asset Management', 'the Finance Ministry', 'IPO', 'IPO', 'Budget']",['close to $12 billion']
Budget 2022 | Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman says Budget for 2022-23 not 'conservative' rather 'responsible',02 February,"Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on February 2 said that the Budget for 2022-23 is not conservative in nature, rather it is responsible.""Being conservative is not wrong. Being conservative is also being responsible,"" Sitharaman said in an interview with Network18's Editor-in-Chief Rahul Joshi.Sitharaman said there were various elements of surprise when dealing with a country's finances and in 2021-22 the outbreak of the second wave of COVID-19 and other factors such as high crude prices continued to push back recovery in the Indian economy.She further said that the government had no doubt that public investment in infrastructure should be kept high.""We wanted to continue the momentum from last year and help the states to move on with their infra spending,"" Sitharaman said.COVID-19 VaccineFrequently Asked QuestionsA vaccine works by mimicking a natural infection. A vaccine not only induces immune response to protect people from any future COVID-19 infection, but also helps quickly build herd immunity to put an end to the pandemic. Herd immunity occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population becomes immune to a disease, making the spread of disease from person to person unlikely. The good news is that SARS-CoV-2 virus has been fairly stable, which increases the viability of a vaccine.There are broadly four types of vaccine — one, a vaccine based on the whole virus (this could be either inactivated, or an attenuated [weakened] virus vaccine); two, a non-replicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of SARS-CoV; three, nucleic-acid vaccines that have genetic material like DNA and RNA of antigens like spike protein given to a person, helping  human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine; and four, protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombinant proteins of SARS-COV-2 along with an adjuvant (booster) is given as a vaccine.Vaccine development is a long, complex process. Unlike drugs that are given to people with a diseased, vaccines are given to healthy people and also vulnerable sections such as children, pregnant women and the elderly. So rigorous tests are compulsory. History says that the fastest time it took to develop a vaccine is five years, but it usually takes double or sometimes triple that time.Only by increasing public expenditure in infrastructure will the economy see a sustainable revival after the aftermath of COVID-19, the finance minister added.""Only by public investment in infra will there be a virtuous cycle and crowding in. We thought if the economy does well, the multiplier effect of spending on infra is higher as opposed to giving money. We wanted to have a maximum multiplier effect that would have an impact on the economy. The economy at this juncture requires strong support,"" Sitharaman said.Furthermore, Sitharaman reiterated that all commitments made by the government in previous years remain and will be executed in due time.The minister said that the Budget for 2022-23 was a continuation of the Budget for the current financial year and that the consideration of upcoming elections in five states was not on her mind while framing the Budget.The finance minister said while elections come and go, the economy required a strong support at this juncture when it was coming out of pandemic and showing very good positive revival signs.She added that the government is still committed to the divestment of all public sector utilities and even the LIC initial public offering.""Not necessary for me to list out but my commitment (towards disinvestment) remains. Air India was complex subject. To be compliant with all diligence required took a lot of work. My commitment remains and continues. LIC IPO plans are going fine . It should happen this year itself. Money from LIC IPO will come this year itself,"" the Finance Minister said.On February 1, Department of Investment and Public Asset Management Secretary Tuhin Kanta had stated that the life insurer was likely to file draft IPO papers within two weeks.The government has revised the disinvestment target for the current fiscal year to Rs 78,000 crore from the Budget estimate of Rs 1.75 lakh crore. With the government already pocketing more than Rs 24,000 crore so far from disinvestment, the proceeds from LIC's IPO are likely to be little more than Rs 50,000 crore.Backing on capital expenditure to revive the economyThe government in the Budget for 2022-23 has announced a 35.4 per cent increase in capital expenditure to Rs 7.50 lakh crore for FY23 from Rs 5.54 lakh crore for FY22, after being able to spend only 65-68 percent of capex utilised in the Buget for FY22 till December.Sitharaman said that the outbreak of the second wave of COVID-19 in May 2021, pushed back the government's capital expenditure spending by a few months and hence only 65-68 percent of the Budgeted amount has been spent till December in 2021-22.However, she said that such a delay due to another wave of COVID-19 is not expected anymore as the third wave of COVID-19 has already started showing signs of backing off.Furthermore, the finance minister said that despite of all the naysayers, the Indian government's commitment towards capital expenditure has also attracted foreign direct investment into the country.Sitharaman said that instead of spending money through revenues on particular sections of society the government opted to invest through the capital expenditure route in infrastructure.She added that for every rupee spent as capital expenditure by the government on infrastructure the Indian economy would get approximately 2.95 times returns.Lack of tax reforms and inflation The finance minister accepted that inflation has been a cause for concern not just for India but for economies around the world. She added that""I think globally all economies are worried about inflation. It does affect planning,"" Sitharaman said, adding that the government was conscious of inflation and would take steps to ensure that inflation rates stay within the designated acceptable band.The minister added that inflation rates in India were high at the moment due to global factors like prices of metal, fossil fuel prices and other imports.She added that within India prices of essential goods such as  pulses and edible oils were high as the country was still dependent on imports of these products and in order to address the high prices production needs to be ramped up.The minister said that idea of cutting tax rates to help the common man deal with inflation was not possible at the moment as the Indian economy was still recovering from the aftermath of COVID-19 and in order to sustain growth public spending was a key.However, she added that ensuring a stable and predictable tax regime the government was making sure that people who have planned are making sure that it remaining unaffected.Cryptocurrency, Fintech and Digital Payments The Finance Minister said that the Reserve Bank of India will soon come out with India's digital currency.""Once it goes through Parliament, RBI will move forward to take cabinet approval and issuing digital rupee. Don't know yet what digital rupee will be called,"" she said.However, she added that private digital assets will not be accepted as digital currency in India and that the government is working to create a distinction between cryptocurrency and digital currency.""Trying to draw this distinction between privately generated crypto assets and digital currency. Private people using the blockchain create it but that cannot be the currency. Currency would be when the RBI issues it. That is why we have gone to Parliament to say we have put the proposal to say the central bank would issue a digital currency,"" the FM said.She added that despite cryptocurrency not being under the ambit of the government individuals were still trading in them and hence the government would tax them and would work with stakeholders to come out with a legislation on them as well.""Will certainly be coming up with a bill post consultation. Don't know when it will come or whether it will regulate crypto,"" Sitharaman said.The FM added that India has shown great strides in the online payment ecosystem in democratizing digital payments.""India is showing leadership. Already at high table of determining global policy on digital stack,"" the finance minister said.She added that a digital university has been also been proposed.""Idea is to make sure that all these digital platforms talk to one another and bring in inter linkage. Eventually your digital stack will need to communicate with digital stacks of other countries. India stack shoud be able to communicate with compatriots elsewhere,"" Sitharaman said.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/budget-2022-finance-minister-nirmala-sitharaman-says-budget-for-2022-23-not-conservative-rather-responsible-8027941.html,IPO,"With the government already pocketing more than Rs 24,000 crore so far from disinvestment, the proceeds from LIC's IPO are likely to be little more than Rs 50,000 crore.Backing on capital expenditure to revive the economyThe government in the Budget for 2022-23 has announced a 35.4 per cent increase in capital expenditure to Rs 7.50 lakh crore for FY23 from Rs 5.54 lakh crore for FY22, after being able to spend only 65-68 percent of capex utilised in the Buget for FY22 till December.Sitharaman said that the outbreak of the second wave of COVID-19 in May 2021, pushed back the government's capital expenditure spending by a few months and hence only 65-68 percent of the Budgeted amount has been spent till December in 2021-22.However, she said that such a delay due to another wave of COVID-19 is not expected anymore as the third wave of COVID-19 has already started showing signs of backing off.Furthermore, the finance minister said that despite of all the naysayers, the Indian government's commitment towards capital expenditure has also attracted foreign direct investment into the country.Sitharaman said that instead of spending money through revenues on particular sections of society the government opted to invest through the capital expenditure route in infrastructure.She added that for every rupee spent as capital expenditure by the government on infrastructure the Indian economy would get approximately 2.95 times returns.Lack of tax reforms and inflation The finance minister accepted that inflation has been a cause for concern not just for India but for economies around the world.It does affect planning,"" Sitharaman said, adding that the government was conscious of inflation and would take steps to ensure that inflation rates stay within the designated acceptable band.The minister added that inflation rates in India were high at the moment due to global factors like prices of metal, fossil fuel prices and other imports.She added that within India prices of essential goods such as  pulses and edible oils were high as the country was still dependent on imports of these products and in order to address the high prices production needs to be ramped up.The minister said that idea of cutting tax rates to help the common man deal with inflation was not possible at the moment as the Indian economy was still recovering from the aftermath of COVID-19 and in order to sustain growth public spending was a key.However, she added that ensuring a stable and predictable tax regime the government was making sure that people who have planned are making sure that it remaining unaffected.Cryptocurrency, Fintech and Digital Payments The Finance Minister said that the Reserve Bank of India will soon come out with India's digital currency.","['LIC', 'IPO', 'Budget', 'Rs', 'Sitharaman', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19', 'Sitharaman', 'Sitharaman', 'COVID-19', 'Fintech', 'Digital Payments\xa0The Finance', 'the Reserve Bank of India']",['35.4 per cent']

More than a decade back, Avendus Group had provided ECM services to corporates and advised on IPOs ( TBZ – Tribhovandas Bhimji Zaveri, Parabolic Drugs to name a few) and QIPs (Nitco Tiles) but later shifted focus to other services.“Especially in the tech, startup and VC space, over the years, Avendus has had a strong relationship with the firms, founders and investors and helped them with M&A and fund raising.

"Chemplast Sanmar does well post IPO, reports 48% jump in consolidated PAT",30 January,"In its first quarter since it came out with an IPO (initial public offer) in August last, Chennai-based Chemplast Sanmar Limited, a specialty chemicals company, reported a 48 percent jump in consolidated PAT (profit before tax).It reported a consolidated PAT of Rs.236.86 crore on revenue of Rs.1,431.68 crore for the quarter ended December, 2021. The consolidated PAT stood at Rs. 159.90 crore in the same quarter last year on revenue of Rs. 1,088.38 crore. The revenue has risen by 33 percent during the quarter under review.Chemplast Sanmar is a dominant producer of specialty paste PVC, having significant presence in the custom manufacturing business. Through its wholly-owned subsidiary, it is the second-largest producer of suspension PVC in the country.Read also: Chemplast Sanmar lines up Rs 650 crore capex planDuring a virtual press briefing on Saturday, company officials said that revenue registered a strong growth on account of higher realisations per tonne for its key products - specialty paste PVC resin, suspension PVC, chloromethanes and caustic soda.On the volume front, the caustic soda volume for the quarter under review was higher. However, specialty paste PVC and suspension PVC volumes were lower on a YoY basis, primarily due to restrictions around operation of downstream units in the NCR region due to poor air quality and the extended monsoons during Q3. The demand for both specialty paste PVC and suspension PVC, the company officials said, had picked up strongly. They are expecting the  inventory to get diluted in near-term.The company has begun dispatches of the two newly-commercialised products of custom-manufactured chemicals business. “The product pipeline is strong with a number of projects at various stages of commercialisation,” a top official said.The company has also got environmental clearance for its proposed specialty paste PVC expansion. “We have received clearance for 70 ktpa, but as of now, we are going ahead with 35 ktpa expansion as Phase 1,” a company release said.In the wake of the IPO, the company has become debt free on a standalone basis and on a consolidated basis, the net debt is negligible.“The demand outlook, for both paste PVC and suspension PVC, is quite strong due to significant deficit and high import dependence in the domestic market. Increasing tight supply at the global level for both these products, augurs well for domestic manufacturers like us. With our dominant position in the Indian market and expansion plans to cater to the growing demand, we believe that we are well-placed to benefit from uptick in the PVC market. Custom manufacturing business is expected to benefit significantly due to China plus one strategy of global innovators,” said Ramkumar Shankar, managing director.The specialty-chemicals business reported a strong quarter with paste PVC registering a higher realisation, resulting in healthy margins. “After reaching all-time highs in October, paste PVC prices corrected a bit and are now trading close to $1,700 –1,750 a tonne. In the near- to medium-term horizon, we expect prices to be range-bound,” he added.On the non-specialty chemicals front, caustic soda prices peaked during the quarter and still continue to be on the higher side. Currently, prices are at a level of $600 – $650 a tonne. The price of chloromethanes in India reached record highs due to limited availability on account of reduced import arrivals. “However, with the addition of new capacity in India, there has been some correction in prices (though even after correction, the prices are still higher than pre-pandemic levels). Once the market absorbs incremental volume, we expect the prices to strengthen again,” the release said.“Suspension PVC prices reached a record high in the month of October largely on account of supply side tightness. Thereafter, prices have softened but continue to remain at healthy levels. We expect prices to continue to remain strong as no significant capacity addition is on the anvil in the near- term,” it said. The prices of feedstock VCM have dropped even more than PVC has.  However, Sanmar officials expect the benefit of the drop in VCM prices to kick in after a lag of 30 to 45 days. The impact of the drop in PVC prices would have an immediate impact, the company said. Vijyay Sankar, vice-chairman of the Sanmar group, said post the IPO the company was well poised to capitalise on the growth opportunities.  According to him, Chemplast was perhaps among a few manufacturing companies in Chennai to report a net profit of over Rs. 400 crore in the first nine months of this current financial year. Reiterating its strong focus on Tamil Nadu, he said Sanmar would strive for a growth with profitability even while emphasising on safety and environmental issues.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/chemplast-sanmar-does-well-post-ipo-reports-48-jump-in-consolidated-pat-8004241.html,IPO,"Through its wholly-owned subsidiary, it is the second-largest producer of suspension PVC in the country.Read also: Chemplast Sanmar lines up Rs 650 crore capex planDuring a virtual press briefing on Saturday, company officials said that revenue registered a strong growth on account of higher realisations per tonne for its key products - specialty paste PVC resin, suspension PVC, chloromethanes and caustic soda.On the volume front, the caustic soda volume for the quarter under review was higher.“We have received clearance for 70 ktpa, but as of now, we are going ahead with 35 ktpa expansion as Phase 1,” a company release said.In the wake of the IPO, the company has become debt free on a standalone basis and on a consolidated basis, the net debt is negligible.“The demand outlook, for both paste PVC and suspension PVC, is quite strong due to significant deficit and high import dependence in the domestic market.","['IPO', 'PVC']","['close to $1,700', '600', '650']"

"As tech stocks fall, investors wonder if the party is over",27 January,"Technology stocks in India and the US have taken a beating, making investors wonder whether the epic bull run leading to unheard of valuations, massive deals for unprofitable companies and a party fueled by rock bottom interest rates may be ending.Newly listed internet companies including the torchbearer Zomato, along with Policybazaar, Nykaa, CarTrade and Paytm have fallen between 10-30 percent in the last five days, data indicates. From their listing highs, they have fallen as much as 50 percent, with billions in market cap evaporating and shifting investor sentiment. Paytm, whose shares have anyway been falling since it listed, is now valued at $8 billion, half its last private round at $16 billion.Zomato’s shares falling 30 percent even prompted founder and CEO Deepinder Goyal to send a note to employees internally to reassure them of its financial position, adding that he has been waiting for a bear market. He certainly isn’t the only one, even as investors poured record money into private and public technology companies despite being wary of their valuations. Last year’s internet IPOs underpinned the excitement of retail investors being able to invest in new companies whose products they consume routinely, a coming-of-age 15 years in the making.""I think some rationality in the market was needed anyway. It was getting overheated. Companies going public now will have to relook their valuation assumptions,” said Punit Shah, partner at Alteria Capital, a venture debt fund.Indian technology stocks have followed their US peers, where shares of companies such as Robinhood, Lyft and Peloton have fallen sharply. Peloton, whose fitness bikes and treadmills became a pandemic favourite, has fallen over 80 percent.The falling shares have led investors to ponder the real worth of these companies, as well as whether other private tech companies are overvalued, given that their aggressive valuations also stemmed from a blistering stock market.Companies listed at valuations significantly higher than private valuations (bar Paytm) only because they saw record demand, and took advantage of investor appetite “I think expectations were poorly managed by the tech companies in their IPOs. Retail investors let their imagination run wild while setting expectations, bothering only about valuation expansion. But,these companies continue to remain extremely hungry for capital and any adverse market sentiment will put their capital raising to grave risk,” said Shyam Sekhar, founder of ithought, a financial advisory firm.He said that large institutional investors realised that these companies will always need money, giving them an opportunity to dump shares now and buy them later if they want to, even as retail investors bought shares at deflated prices.Due to low interest rates in the US and other countries, investors increased their allocation to riskier sectors such as technology, eyeing better returns than traditional asset classes. Now, as inflation rises, central banks may hike interest rates again, reducing the money available for tech companies, and leading to a selloff.""With interest rates rising, valuation multiples have to cool off. Companies with lower cash flows will see their multiples fall more. Tech companies are typically growth focused, so with less cash flow, they may be hit,” said Sandeep Jethwani, co-founder of wealth management startup Dezerv.""Companies going for an IPO will have to recalibrate and benchmark to other companies globally. Last year there were also a lot of narrative stocks, fuelled by Reddit etc, which will return to normalcy,” he added.Investors are yet unable to conclude whether a bear market is truly setting in, or the recent correction is only an aberration.“This is probably just markets looking for reasons to correct. This is what markets are, super volatile. It is too early to say if this is sudden sanity or just a liquidation or a fire sale. We should wait a few months,” said Deepak Shenoy, founder of Capital Mind, an advisory firm.Indian technology stocks have followed their US peersOther companies gearing up to go public this year including e commerce logistics firm Delhivery, hotelier Oyo, and retail brands such as Fabindia and Bikaji, in addition to insurer Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC), which is eyeing India’s biggest ever IPO by raising upto Rs 1 lakh crore. If the chill persists, private startup valuations may also start getting hit, with investors recalibrating companies’ real worth.“We are not seeing signs of deals in India slowing down right now, but typically there is a lag of 2-3 months till the chill of public markets is felt on private markets,” said Alteria’s Shah.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/as-tech-stocks-fall-investors-wonder-if-the-party-is-over-7988561.html,IPO,"Peloton, whose fitness bikes and treadmills became a pandemic favourite, has fallen over 80 percent.The falling shares have led investors to ponder the real worth of these companies, as well as whether other private tech companies are overvalued, given that their aggressive valuations also stemmed from a blistering stock market.Companies listed at valuations significantly higher than private valuations (bar Paytm) only because they saw record demand, and took advantage of investor appetite “I think expectations were poorly managed by the tech companies in their IPOs.But,these companies continue to remain extremely hungry for capital and any adverse market sentiment will put their capital raising to grave risk,” said Shyam Sekhar, founder of ithought, a financial advisory firm.He said that large institutional investors realised that these companies will always need money, giving them an opportunity to dump shares now and buy them later if they want to, even as retail investors bought shares at deflated prices.Due to low interest rates in the US and other countries, investors increased their allocation to riskier sectors such as technology, eyeing better returns than traditional asset classes.",['Peloton'],"['$8 billion', '$16 billion']"
"MC Interview: upGrad to turn profitable in 2022-23, likely to float IPO in 2 years: Co-founder Mayank Kumar",26 January,"Edtech unicorn upGrad is set to become profitable in 2022-23 and thinking to get listed in the stock market possibly in 24 months from now, co-founder and managing director Mayank Kumar told Moneycontrol in an interview.Kumar said his firm is set to cut losses and more than double its revenue in the fiscal ending 31 March 2022. This after the edtech clocked over Rs.302 crore of revenue in Fy21 and around Rs.210 crore of loss in the same timeframe. He said during the initial years, they need to invest more in people, products and outreach to become a successful company of future, and the losses should be seen with an investment perspective.Kumar told Moneycontrol during the interview that upGrad aims to acquire more firms in the B2B, and corporate learning space; and they will finally unlock value for shareholders by floating IPO and going to the stock market. Edited Excerpts:Q) Last year, you had earmarked $250 million for M&A activities and have acquired five to six firms since then. Have you exhausted all the corpus, and kept aside more funds for the acquisition of more firms?We will have more corpus for acquiring more companies because from a core business perspective, we continue to grow. Yes, more capital is needed for business growth. We believe that if like-minded entrepreneurs come together, we can build a business of scale.Q) upGrad is on an acquisition spree. What are the areas you wish to focus here on while evaluating M&A candidates?Ans: I think there are a couple of areas -- B2B learning and B2B enterprise is definitely areas we are excited about. We feel that there's enough scope and potential there. It is highly fragmented, and we believe, we can do something meaningful there. India is a big market...once we know that in India we are fully consolidated, we shall look at international markets.Q) You said this quarter may become profitable for you. But if you look at numbers: your loss was around Rs. 211 crore in Fy21, three-fold more than the year before period. How to justify that?Ans: One needs to realize that we are a different type of firm. A lot of our cost that goes in is actually payroll, for building products, for building technology products, building their skills, for building content. These are all investments right now. So technically speaking, these are not put up as Capex, while in previous time where accounting wise you can put everything as capex. While I agree that the loss has gone up, but these are investments to build products of the future.Number two, we are in an ecosystem or a market where the behaviour is not there. And you have to set the behavior. When you are setting the bevaviour, you do need to invest in changing and making sure that the ecosystem behavior also changes. You do want to invest in making sure the consumers are aware, and are looking at things in a much more favorable manner.Q) Your revenue was around Rs.302 crores last fiscal; how are you placed in FY22 given that you have just two months left in the fiscal?And: Our revenue will more than double the previous number, and our growth will sustain. We have been almost doubling year on year. The reason why the growth happens is that you are pushing and making things happen; your learners are achieving success and getting good RoI. That’s making learners come to us. Education, unlike other sectors, takes time to show the result. We are seeing learners’ success and feeling satisfied; when we see profitability, I will be equally excited because we have shareholders to respond and answer to.Q) When are you going to be a profitable company?Ans: We are expecting this quarter to be profitable. And yes, we will become a profitable company in 2022-23.Q) When will upGrad float an IPO to go public?Ans: If your end goal is where will you unlock value, then listing is the place where we will look at to unlock value, or at least providing the right liquidity for our shareholders.  The exact timeline is yet to be defined… and it’s going to be at least two years away because there is a fair bit of work we need to do to get to the listing day. There is a lot of building blocks we need to set up.I would say, may be give and take, 24 months on the median side is what we are thinking about. And that is definitely a goal. So 2024-25 may be the time when we will potentially be there.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/companies/mc-interview-upgrad-to-turn-profitable-in-2022-23-likely-to-float-ipo-in-2-years-co-founder-mayank-kumar-7987911.html,IPO,"He said during the initial years, they need to invest more in people, products and outreach to become a successful company of future, and the losses should be seen with an investment perspective.Kumar told Moneycontrol during the interview that upGrad aims to acquire more firms in the B2B, and corporate learning space; and they will finally unlock value for shareholders by floating IPO and going to the stock market.You do want to invest in making sure the consumers are aware, and are looking at things in a much more favorable manner.Q) Your revenue was around Rs.302 crores last fiscal; how are you placed in FY22 given that you have just two months left in the fiscal?And: Our revenue will more than double the previous number, and our growth will sustain.",['IPO'],['$250 million']

"Mobikwik expects to double revenue this fiscal, stays cautious on IPO launch",23 January,"IPO-bound fintech firm Mobikwik is expecting to close the current financial year with 100 per cent revenue growth, a top company official said.Mobikwik chairperson and chief operating officer Upasana Taku told PTI that the company's initial public offer (IPO) is a monumental opportunity for the company and will not like to hit the market when it is behaving erratically but wait for the market condition to stabilise.The company, which posted a narrowing of loss to Rs 111.3 crore and revenue of Rs 302.25 crore in the financial year 2021, expects to double the revenue by the end of current financial year.Talking about the path to profitability of the company, Taku did not mention any definite timeline but said that if the company is able to increase revenue and keep control on the cost then losses can be covered over in a few quarters.""In just two quarters we have already achieved the revenue number of last year. Any investor can calculate what will be business performance for the full year. It will look like that the company has doubled the revenue and EBITDA losses are the same or lower. If you have crossed Rs 300 crore till Diwali, then you have a clue on where you are going to land,"" Taku said.She said that the company has been doubling revenue every year since the last 4 years and has been controlling losses.The company in its draft document for IPO mentioned that it was hit by the Covid-19 pandemic and the BNPL (Buy Now Pay Later) segment gross merchandise value decreased by 38.22 per cent to Rs 299.94 crore in 2020-21 from Rs 4,85.49 crore in 2019-20.Taku said the business has now crossed to pre-Covid levels and the company has had good performance during the current financial year.""Our BNPL business has grown 22 times compared to last year and the payments business has grown three times,"" she said.The company plans to raise Rs 1,500 crore from the IPO.When asked about the timelines for the launch of IPO, Taku said the company has permission to hit the market till November 2022 and it will go for listing once the market conditions become stable.""I think that it is common sense that if the markets are acting erratically then why do you want to risk the outcome of something for which you worked so hard? We have been working very hard for the last 12 years to get to this stage. I cannot think of any internet company which has reached over 10 crore users, having spent only Rs 700 crore.

How LIC’s IPO has pushed a race for new demat accounts,20 January,"India’s largest insurer – Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC) – is expected to file its IPO (initial public offering) prospectus soon. While LIC is ironing out the finer points before launching the mega IPO (expected to be worth over Rs 1 lakh crore), brokers are getting ready to cash in on the huge interest from LIC policyholders.The government’s decision to create a 10 percent policyholders’ quota in the IPO – a first-of-its-kind – and the possibility of a discount on IPO price, has pushed several policyholders to open their demat accounts. A demat account is a must to invest in any IPO.Brokerages believe that the LIC IPO may help them to get several new customers, as many first-time capital market investors will be opening their demat accounts just to invest in the IPO.“We expect 10-30 lakh new demat accounts to be opened just to participate in the LIC IPO,” says Prakarsh Gagdani, chief executive officer of discount broker 5Paisa.com, an IIFL subsidiary.However, the final numbers could beat the estimates as Gagdani admits that if policyholders are given a discount, then several of them would want to apply for the IPO.LIC penetration vs broking penetrationLIC has over 25 crore policyholders, compared to 8 crore existing demat accounts. As several of these will be first-time investors in stock markets, brokers want to simplify the investing process for them.“We are making our user interface simple so that these investors can easily open their accounts,” says Ajay Menon, MD and CEO-broking and distribution, Motilal Oswal Financial Services (MOFSL).“Penetration of LIC is much more than that of broking industry. So, this will help us to get new customers. We are getting in touch with policyholders as well as LIC agents,” Menon adds.Over the last seven years (financial years 2015-2021), LIC, on an average, sold 2.08 crore new individual policies. On the other hand, demat accounts have only now started to see sharp growth amid the COVID-19 pandemic.In financial year 2020-2021, the number of demat accounts grew by 29 percent year-on-year and in the current financial year 2021-2022 (up to October 31, 2021), the number has grown by 37 percent.Also read: LIC IPO: Decoding the metrics, products and terms in life insurance that matter for investorsOnline investing platform Groww is also gearing up for the LIC IPO. We have built our systems to support the additional technicalities (policyholder quota) of the IPO. We are seeing lot of interest across our YouTube and social media channels,” says Harsh Jain, co-founder of Groww.No missing out on a big brandLIC has been a household name for long. The insurance company has 61.4 percent market share of new business premiums in the life insurance space as of December 31, 2021 (data from insurance regulator IRDAI). This is 1.59-times the market share of the entire private sector life insurers. Compared to the second-largest insurer SBI Life, LIC's market share is 6.7-times.LIC agents say policyholders don’t want to miss out on such an investment opportunity and want to make sure that they fulfil all the requirements.“Every day, we are seeing 200-300 PANs getting updated in our client database. We currently service over 45,000 policies. Since the last two months, our offices in Maharashtra have been receiving an average of over 30 calls and visits from those keen on participating in the IPO,” says Bharat Parekh, a Mumbai-based LIC agent.LIC has told policyholders to update their PAN and demat details.Some are even buying new policies just to be eligible for the IPO. “We primarily deal with high networth individuals. Many of them are coming forward to buy LIC policies for their family members so that the entire family is eligible for the preferential allotment,” he adds.These policyholders would also need handholding as several of them are likely to be older in age.“Our entire family will be investing in LIC IPO. In fact, my 78-year-old mother-in-law will be opening a demat account specifically to invest in the public offer. It’s a highly trustworthy brand and having been LIC policyholders over the years, we want to now be part of its IPO too,” says Kirit Joshi, 51, Nagpur-based businessperson.Sonal Mehta, 55, home-maker, says all five members of her family, including her elderly in-laws, want to participate in the LIC IPO. She adds that her household help is a LIC policyholder and is also aware of the IPO. “If she takes the call to invest, I plan to help her open a demat account,” she says.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/personal-finance/how-lics-ipo-has-pushed-a-race-for-new-demat-accounts-7961281.html,IPO,"While LIC is ironing out the finer points before launching the mega IPO (expected to be worth over Rs 1 lakh crore), brokers are getting ready to cash in on the huge interest from LIC policyholders.The government’s decision to create a 10 percent policyholders’ quota in the IPO – a first-of-its-kind – and the possibility of a discount on IPO price, has pushed several policyholders to open their demat accounts.A demat account is a must to invest in any IPO.Brokerages believe that the LIC IPO may help them to get several new customers, as many first-time capital market investors will be opening their demat accounts just to invest in the IPO.“We expect 10-30 lakh new demat accounts to be opened just to participate in the LIC IPO,” says Prakarsh Gagdani, chief executive officer of discount broker 5Paisa.com, an IIFL subsidiary.However, the final numbers could beat the estimates as Gagdani admits that if policyholders are given a discount, then several of them would want to apply for the IPO.LIC penetration vs broking penetrationLIC has over 25 crore policyholders, compared to 8 crore existing demat accounts.","['LIC', 'IPO', 'LIC', 'IPO', 'IPO', 'IPO', 'IPO', 'Gagdani']",[]

"LIC IPO: Decoding the metrics, products and terms in life insurance that matter for investors",18 January,"The mega initial public offering from Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC) is expected to be just around the corner. In what may be a unique aspect of the IPO, LIC is likely to reserve a portion of the shares for its over 250 million policyholders and may also offer them a discount. LIC has been putting out advertisements explaining how policyholders should open Demat accounts needed to trade in shares.While policyholders may be aware of LIC’s products, as potential investors, it would be worthwhile for them to understand certain terms and the jargon associated with life insurance companies and their valuations.Key ProductsLife insurers provide cover against mortality (death) and morbidity risks (illness), apart from savings products. The range of products includes term assurance, annuities, endowments, pension plans and unit-linked saving plans (ULIPs) to suit varying needs.Protection business Individual term life products cover mortality and pay only in the event of death. Typically, nothing is paid out if an insured individual survives the policy term in the case of term insurance. Group products are business-to-business dealings and include group credit-life, group-life and group health.Savings businessIn savings plans, the primary objective is long-term savings with returns on investment – there is a maturity amount along with life cover, which is relatively lower than in term insurance plans.Savings products can be further sub-divided into traditional products – participating (par) and non-participating (non-par) – and unit-linked products.Par products - A minimal return is guaranteed and policyholders participate in the profit of the policy. Also called with-profit policies. In India, the surplus is shared in a 90:10 ratio with 90 percent going to policyholders and 10 percent to shareholders.Non-par products – The pay-outs are fully guaranteed at the start of the policy. Policyholders do not participate in the profit of the policy.Unit-linked policies (ULIP) – These offer market-linked returns, where the amount accruing to policyholders depends on the fund’s performance.Group savings products – These are fund management products where insurance companies manage funds for large business groups. Examples: gratuity, superannuation and leave encashment.Product MixProduct mix is an important factor to consider as it drives the margins and profitability of the insurer. Many private life insurers want to increase the share of the protection business (pure term insurance) in their product mix because it offers a relatively higher margin than ULIPs.Product mix in life insurance sector Chart shows product mix of all players – LIC and private companies. Private players have been active selling savings-linked insurance products that provide investment returns linked to an underlying fund like ULIP. In the past few years, private players have focused more on pure protection products (term assurance) and the annuity segment. LIC, on the other hand, is focused on traditional, non-linked products. (Chart Credit: Moneycontrol)Channel MixInsurance needs strong marketing and sales teams to succeed, implying significant distribution costs in the form of commissions. Therefore, the distribution mix, or the channels for selling insurance products, is equally important and plays a decisive role in growth. Private companies typically use bancassurance – banks acting as corporate agents to sell insurance products to their customers – as their primary distributors. LIC, on the other hand, depends on an army of individual agents spread across the country to sell its policies.Channels in life insurance industry Chart depicts growing clout of bancassurance among private players. For the industry as a whole, agency is still the largest distributor because of LIC’s size. (Chart Credit: Moneycontrol)Key Ratios for Life InsurersAnnualised premium equivalent: It is the sum of the annualised first-year premiums on regular premium policies and 10 percent of single premiums from both individual and group customers.Persistency ratio: Persistency is a measure of the policies remaining in force (not lapsed) as a proportion of policies issued in a particular period. The proportion of policies in force after the end of the first policy year is known as the 13th month persistency, while the share of those remaining in force after the second policy year is known as the 25th month persistency and so on.High persistency means a bigger book of business and higher recurring profit from both management fees and investment income.Solvency ratio: It is the capital required by an insurance company to run its business, taking into account the portfolio of its policies. Current regulations demand a minimum solvency ratio of 150 per cent at all times.Embedded value: Embedded value is the present value of all future profits from existing business plus net worth. Once the embedded value is known, it is assigned a multiple to arrive at a valuation. This is the most important concept because life insurers are valued on basis of embedded value.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/lic-ipo-decoding-metrics-products-terms-in-life-insurance-for-investors-7951851.html,IPO,"Group products are business-to-business dealings and include group credit-life, group-life and group health.Savings businessIn savings plans, the primary objective is long-term savings with returns on investment – there is a maturity amount along with life cover, which is relatively lower than in term insurance plans.Savings products can be further sub-divided into traditional products – participating (par) and non-participating (non-par) – and unit-linked products.Par products - A minimal return is guaranteed and policyholders participate in the profit of the policy.The proportion of policies in force after the end of the first policy year is known as the 13th month persistency, while the share of those remaining in force after the second policy year is known as the 25th month persistency and so on.High persistency means a bigger book of business and higher recurring profit from both management fees and investment income.Solvency ratio: It is the capital required by an insurance company to run its business, taking into account the portfolio of its policies.",['Par'],['150 per cent']

"IPO-bound Oyo targets valuation of $9 billion, SEBI nod expected soon: Report",17 January,"Oyo Hotels and Homes, the parent entity of hospitality firm Oyo, is targeting a valuation of $9 billion in its initial public offering (IPO), Bloomberg reported on January 17, citing persons who are privy to the development.The company is likely to receive the Securities and Exchange Board of India's (SEBI) nod for its IPO round within the next couple of weeks, the sources reportedly said.The $9 billion valuation, which they claim the startup would target, would be lower than $12 billion as initially reported in the local media.Reports have hinted that Qatar Insurance Co (QIC), a few HNIs and family offices have bought stake in the company late last year.Oyo founder Ritesh Agarwal, who holds 33 percent stake in the company, would not be offloading his stake through the IPO, as per the offer for sale released in October.Besides Agarwal, Lightspeed Venture Partners, Sequoia Capital, Star Virtue Investment (Didi), Greenoaks Capital, AirBnB, HT Media and Microsoft are not diluting their shareholding.The offer for sale comprises aggregate shares from a small part of SVF India (Softbank), A1 Holdings Inc.

The draft listed the prevailing COVID-19 pandemic, slow growth and dispute with rival Zostel among key risk factors.Soon after Oyo's DRHP was filed, Zostel had written to SEBI, calling for rejection of Oyo’s prospectus and suspension of its IPO.Notably, Oyo had decided to raise capital through public offering last year, with Moneycontrol being among the first to report about the company's plans in July.The decision was made public shortly after the Softbank-backed homegrown firm announced the closure of a debt financing round of $660 million from global institutional investors such as Fidelity Investments, Citadel Capital Management and Varde Partners with an aim to retire some of its existing debts and pump up its operations and product technology.Oyo, which is counted among India's top startups, hit a roadblock in 2020 during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. The company reported a net loss of Rs 3,929 crore in the fiscal ending in March 2021, which was still lower than Rs Rs 12,799 crore in the previous fiscal.Recovering from the crisis, Oyo completely changed its model to a revenue share one, as compared to the earlier, where it would pay its hotel partners a minimum guarantee.The company also adopted innovative measures in a bid to increase its customer base. Agarwal, the company's 28-year-old leader, recently said they are ""committed to making India a leading global hotspot for travellers through experiential tourism like rural homestays, replicating the Kevadia model in states like Ladakh, Haryana, Tamil Nadu and J&K.""",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/ipo-bound-oyo-targets-valuation-of-9-billion-sebi-nod-expected-soon-report-7949011.html,IPO,"Oyo Hotels and Homes, the parent entity of hospitality firm Oyo, is targeting a valuation of $9 billion in its initial public offering (IPO), Bloomberg reported on January 17, citing persons who are privy to the development.The company is likely to receive the Securities and Exchange Board of India's (SEBI) nod for its IPO round within the next couple of weeks, the sources reportedly said.The $9 billion valuation, which they claim the startup would target, would be lower than $12 billion as initially reported in the local media.Reports have hinted that Qatar Insurance Co (QIC), a few HNIs and family offices have bought stake in the company late last year.Oyo founder Ritesh Agarwal, who holds 33 percent stake in the company, would not be offloading his stake through the IPO, as per the offer for sale released in October.Besides Agarwal, Lightspeed Venture Partners, Sequoia Capital, Star Virtue Investment (Didi), Greenoaks Capital, AirBnB, HT Media and Microsoft are not diluting their shareholding.The offer for sale comprises aggregate shares from a small part of SVF India (Softbank), A1 Holdings Inc.

The company now wants to build scale and aims for an initial public offering in two years, Arun Maheshwari, joint managing director and chief executive officer of JSW Infrastructure told Moneycontrol’s Rachita Prasad. Edited excerpts:The company has stated that the proceeds of the bonds issue would be used to retire old debt. What will be the saving on interest cost?We have a debt of around $500 million and much of it will be replaced with the funds we have raised. Our cost of funds will come down by an average of 3%.JSW Infrastructure is no more the captive port business that it used to be. What are the growth plans?We got into this business to secure our own supply chain but now we feel we can leverage on our expertise to expand this business. We started with 10% of third-party volume and increased it slowly to 30%. Our target is to achieve 40% of our total volume from third-party business, even as our total volumes increases.Our effort has been to maximize operations and change the image of this company as a captive cargo business as we felt there is good opportunity in the cargo business and very few players within India. But we don’t want to leverage our balancesheet too much. We will be very cautious in assessing all our opportunities. So far we are quite concentrated in Maharashtra; we would like to spread our risk and expand our customer base, products and geographies. If there are compelling acquisition opportunities, we will look at it or we will grow on our own through greenfield projects.There is a huge opportunity but the port business is also competitive. How so you intend to increase your share in a market where others like Adani Ports have early mover’s advantage?I defer that there is a lot competition in the market. India has a huge coastline and every port will have its own hinterland, customer base, and stickiness of the cargo. There is space for everyone to survive and thrive. There is room for more ports, India only needs to work on the connectivity of these ports now.Typically, JSW has incubated new businesses and once they reach a certain size, they have listed them. Is an initial public offer (IPO) for JSW Infrastructure on cards? We will be going for an IPO in the coming years; it may not happen immediately. Given the timeframe and our needs, it could happen in two years. We would be listing the port business.You have explored greenfield projects like the Rs 3,800 crore-Nargol port project, for which the state government has invited global bids. Are you going ahead with the bids?At a group level we will be developing something in Orissa because JSW is setting up a steel plant. There are several opportunities within India. We are still assessing these options and don’t have a concrete plan yet. As for the Gujarat project, we're still looking at it. Personally I feel it is quite cost intensive and this place will be crowded. Ports like JNPT, Mundra, Hazira, they are all in the same line. So we are assessing right now whether the volumes here will justify the capex.Would you diversify into any other segments within infrastructure?We are not averse to new businesses that add value. A lot of opportunities keep coming our way. But we don’t want to enter other businesses just because we have the capability and there is an opportunity. We will get into it only if it is a long term bet for us, it is meaningful and value accretive for us. So we are aggressive but at the same time we are very cautious.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/companies/jsw-infra-will-be-a-listed-port-company-in-two-years-ceo-7939041.html,IPO,"What will be the saving on interest cost?We have a debt of around $500 million and much of it will be replaced with the funds we have raised.Our target is to achieve 40% of our total volume from third-party business, even as our total volumes increases.Our effort has been to maximize operations and change the image of this company as a captive cargo business as we felt there is good opportunity in the cargo business and very few players within India.",[],"['$400 million', 'around $500 million']"
"IPO Financing | Its colourful past, and RBI’s tightening grip",12 January,"The recent BharatPe-Kotak controversy is understandably viral for the abusive call allegedly made. But the underlying subject — viz., IPO (Initial Public Offers) financing — got sidelined, and needs a closer look. This is particularly since it has seen, over the years, multiple interesting developments. The most recent is the Reserve Bank of India’s mandate to NBFCs to severely restrict such financing.IPO financing, to simplify, is providing finance to a person seeking to subscribe to an IPO. It is finance for a very short period, usually just a week or so. The borrower uses the finance to subscribe for the IPO. The subscriber comes to know the outcome of their application within days — thanks to an ever-shortening period which, in turn, is thanks to SEBI’s relentless simplifying of procedure, and improving technology. The subscriber usually sells the shares allotted and returns the amount borrowed with interest after pocketing the profits (or coughs up the loss).IPO FinancingIPOs have been heavily pursued in recent months, with many IPOs being subscribed multiple times. IPO financing then is sought not just to obtain money to subscribe, but also to increase one’s chances by subscribing for a much higher quantity. Avid believers of the efficient market hypothesis would rightly wonder why IPOs should be so heavily over-subscribed at all, and why should there be expectation of hefty profits. This is more so since pricing of IPOs is carefully calibrated using expert advice of merchant bankers.Unlike the CCI era, today there are no restrictions on pricing of IPOs, and SEBI has instead relied on more and more information to be disclosed. This should result in the issuer setting the best price it can get, leaving, at least in theory, just a bare reasonable margin for profit, and that too for the long-term investor. Yet handsome profits are being made, and thus IPO financing is increasingly sought.It is no surprise that there would be serious disappointment, and even legal cases, if promised IPO finance does not materialise.Grey Market And MulesThe craze for IPOs ‘financing’ has seen controversies earlier too, though of a different kind. In the heyday of the Harshad Mehta boom times, there was a flood of IPOs, with many giving handsome returns, while many being fly-by-night operations.There was even a flourishing grey market for upcoming IPOs, with the grey market quotes actually being circulated along with ‘bhav copies’ (pamphlets giving closing market prices of shares). People resorted to multiple applications in their own name, and of their family and even staff, which was multiplied even further by applying under multiple combinations of each name. The technology those days did not enable easy weeding out of such multiple applications.Dematerialisation more or less eliminated this, but brought a new ‘innovation’. Demat accounts in lakhs were opened, even in fake names. An amusing aspect here was that fake names and photos were picked up even from matrimonial sites!Applications were made in the name of such persons (such name-lenders were called ‘mules’) financed by others. When shares were allotted, they were sold, and the profits pocketed by the financier, with a fee presumably going to the mule. The case of Rupalben Panchal became a kind of flag bearer by which this scam became known.These methods were seen as a blatant abuse of the retail allocation rule for IPOs. Then, generally, there have regularly been cases of companies covertly financing their own IPOs, which is an offence under the Companies Act, 2013. Even GDR issues were found to be allegedly the subject of such manipulative financing.Control RiskComing back to recent times, the question again is why should IPOs be a craze at all? If there is one, isn’t it very likely that yet again there is a bubble which could leave investors, and their financiers, at a loss? SEBI has refused, and rightly so, to meddle, and has done just some tweaking of the law relating to IPOs.However, it is the Reserve Bank of India that has made a far more impactful change, which could reduce IPO finance to a miniscule of what it is today. It can even be seen as arbitrary. The RBI has decided that from April 1, the NBFCs shall provide a maximum of Rs 1 crore of IPO financing per borrower. Contrast this with the Rs 500 crore of IPO finance allegedly involved in just one case of BharatPe founders, and that too for just one IPO.The objective of RBI's mandate seems to be to control risk to the financial sector. To be fair, IPO financing does see huge leverage, which results in huge risks. In comparison with financing purchase of shares, where a fair margin is kept, IPO financing is often multiple times the amount put in by the investor.On the other hand, this unreasonably low and absolute limit placed will prevent even well secured borrowings. A better step could have been tweaking the margin requirements for such financing. A 50 percent margin, for example, could be fairly sufficient for a week’s risk.SEBI has also recently started the process of recognising ‘accredited investors’ who are expected to be financially literate, and strong enough to take on more risky investments. An exemption for such persons from this limit would have made sense. Be as it may be, the fears of the industry seem to be well justified — that the RBI may well have delivered a near fatal blow to IPO financing.Jayant Thakur is a chartered accountant.Views are personal and do not represent the stand of this publication.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/opinion/ipo-financing-its-colourful-past-and-rbis-tightening-grip-7927451.html,IPO,"SEBI has refused, and rightly so, to meddle, and has done just some tweaking of the law relating to IPOs.However, it is the Reserve Bank of India that has made a far more impactful change, which could reduce IPO finance to a miniscule of what it is today.Be as it may be, the fears of the industry seem to be well justified — that the RBI may well have delivered a near fatal blow to IPO financing.Jayant Thakur is a chartered accountant.Views are personal and do not represent the stand of this publication.","['the Reserve Bank of India', 'IPO', 'RBI', 'IPO']",[]

"From unicorn founder, banking license to toxic culture and legal notices: Ashneer Grover and BharatPe's rollercoaster journey",11 January,"Ashneer Grover seems to have lived many lives in a few years where most people's one life was threatened by the Covid-19 pandemic.

Its valuation zoomed to nearly $3 billion, making the 3 year-old firm India's third most valuable fintech for a few months.Behind the scenes though, a wildly different set of things were happening. BharatPe's employees were leaving in droves due to a poor and punishing work culture, and Grover stepped back for Suhail Sameer to take charge of daily affairs of the company.And in the last week things really heated up. Grover was found in a leaked audio to be verbally abusing and screaming at a Kotak Mahindra Bank employee for not getting allocation to Nykaa's Initial Public Offering (IPO). While Grover denied the claims, the evidence is now irrefutable.

Moneycontrol Pro Panorama | The economic impact of Omicron,07 January,"Dear Reader,Omicron numbers are turning ominous. India reported 117,100 new COVID-19 cases in last 24 hours, the highest since June.A new modelling study by the Indian Institute of Science and Indian Statistical Institute, Bangalore, has predicted that this wave of the pandemic will peak by the end of January or early February. The all India COVID-19 cases curve will start flattening by March, it has forecast.While initial reports and data suggest that the Omicron strain is leading to fewer hospitalisation and fatalities, its increased contagiousness means that peak daily cases could well be around a million a day in India. Remember that during the second wave, cases had peaked at 400,000 a day.The sheer number of cases could strain the medical infrastructure in the country. Look at what’s happening in the US, for example. Even though the hospitalisation rate is just 25 percent of the earlier wave, the peak in daily cases is around 4 times that of the previous waves; hence, absolute hospital admissions are at the same level as during the last wave.Can India’s healthcare system face the onslaught of this tsunami with confidence? That’s the question our Herd Immunity Tracker explores today. We also have a piece on what the Omicron wave means for listed companies in the hospitals/healthcare sector.On a related note, what does this sharp rise in cases mean for the economy?A few states have imposed night time and weekend curfews to stem the tide of rising cases. Will we see more stringent lockdowns? As of now there isn’t enough clarity although a few states have provided some guidance — Maharashtra, for example, has said that it will introduce lockdown like restrictions when 40 percent of COVID hospital beds are occupied.For now, economists are sitting on previous estimates. In a note yesterday, DBS Research said that the “economic impact is likely to be shallower than the second wave, drawing on past/international experience.” It has retained its GDP forecasts while building in downside risks and also expects a slower policy normalisation accompanied by gradual reduction in fiscal deficits.Investing insights from our research teamVenky's – Accumulate For The Long HaulWeekly Tactical Pick – CSB BankGodrej Consumer Products: Quarterly investor updateTitan: Strong quarter; to outperform in current scenarioWhat else are we reading today?The energy sector has a gas problem Chart of the day | Global food prices bring some welcome newsDon’t expect LIC to turn world class after going publicPersonal Finance: How to deal with laggards in a portfolioAlgo Rhythm: The algo trading system development model: Part IFTA frenzy — Early harvest schemes key to successGrowth equity booms as investors embrace private markets (republished from the FT)Technical picks: Bata, Angel One, Nitin Spinners and Tata Motors  (These are published every trading day before markets open)Also, check out MC30, our curated basket of 30 mutual fund schemes from the 1,660 available in the Indian market. This will help you build a solid mutual fund investments portfolio.Thank you for subscribing to Moneycontrol Pro. Check out our offers page here for exclusive discounts on select brands and giveaways. We would love to hear from you.

Moneycontrol Pro Panorama| SEBI's IPO pacifier,05 January,"Dear Reader,The Panorama newsletter is sent to Moneycontrol Pro subscribers on market days. It offers easy access to stories published on Moneycontrol Pro and gives a little extra by setting out a context or an event or trend that investors should keep track of.The Indian primary market had its best year in 2021 with record fundraising and oversubscription numbers.A total of 63 companies raised Rs 1.20 lakh crore from the public. 2021 will also be remembered as the year when start-ups moved from being held by a few private equity companies to widely-held public companies. Among the new-age companies that hit the market in 2021 were Paytm, Zomato, PB Fintech, Nykaa, CarTrade Tech, Fino Payments Bank, MapmyIndia, and Nazara Technologies.Many records in the primary market were broken in 2021. For the first time, two companies saw oversubscriptions of 300 times. The highest ever subscription for an issue was seen in Latent View Analytics at 326.5 times, followed by Paras Defence and Space Technologies at 304.3 times. A total of 17 IPOs saw more than 100 times subscriptions.It’s this frenzy that caught SEBI’s attention. SEBI has tried to control the madness in the primary market on two fronts.One is by making companies tapping the market become more transparent on their use of funds and tightening norms for anchor and private equity investors.On the second front, SEBI has attacked the source of euphoria. Most IPOs saw very high bidding in the non-institutional investor (NII) segment, thanks to a product offered by lenders called IPO Funding. Within this segment, the smaller investors – those subscribing between Rs 2 lakh and Rs 10 lakh were at the receiving end as they never got an allotment of shares. SEBI has reserved a third of the portion for bids in this segment.Allotment will now be on draw of lots, the same as the retail segment, in order to allot minimum application size for applicants in case of oversubscription. The balance allotment will be done on a proportionate basis. This move by SEBI has shrunk the NII segment and will have an impact on future IPOs.Along with this action by SEBI, IPO markets will be hit by RBI’s restrictions on IPO funding by NBFCs. RBI has restricted them from lending more than Rs 1 crore to IPO investors from April 1st, 2022.The moves by authorities are important and necessary to bring some sanity to the IPO market. However, these have been announced just before big and important issues such as the ones being planned by LIC and NSE.Given the size of LIC’s issue, the government would need the backing of IPO funding to see the issue sail through comfortably, in which case it will have to float the issue before RBI’s deadline of April 1. Investing insights from our research team:GAIL India: Well placed to benefit from multiple tailwindsSharda Cropchem Ltd: Healthy earnings outlook; attractive valuationsWhat else are we reading?Jet’s revival remains a non-starter as the New Year begins, but there is a silver liningStart-Up Street: The nature and composition of the Indian economy is changing rapidly, throwing up new investment opportunitiesWhy is the market ignoring OmicronDigital revolution and COVID set to transform urban IndiaWhat demand for work under MGNREGA tells us about consumption demand​Services sector rebound in Oct-Dec 2021 strongest since 2011, but third wave loomsPicks from our technical analysts: BEL, Welspun, Tata Power, Grasim​(These are published every trading day before markets open)Also, check out MC30, our curated basket of 30 mutual fund schemes from the 1,660 available in the Indian market.

The year in review: SEBI’s notable decisions in 2021,31 December,"The year 2021 will be memorable for many reasons. One of the best examples is this year’s record-breaking stock market performance – 65 companies went public and the benchmark indices skyrocketed, with the BSE Sensex crossing the 50,000 mark for the first time.With stocks booming, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi), the market regulator, had its hands full over the past 12 months, changing norms to strengthen the system and make it fairer and more transparent for investors.A look back at SEBI’s notable decisions taken at its six board meetings over the year.IPO reforms, mutual fund regulations, NII allocations - December 28   At its last board meeting of 2021, Sebi amended mutual fund regulations, tweaked allocations for non-institutional investors (NIIs) and fine-tuned rules for initial public offerings.IPO reforms The board amended the norms for making an offer for sale during an IPO. As per the new rules, shareholders with more than 20 percent of the pre-issue shareholding cannot sell more than half their stake during an IPO. An investor with a less than 20 percent stake cannot sell more than 10 percent of the pre-issue shareholding of the issuer.The regulator increased the lock-in period for anchor investors. For 50 percent of the portion allocated to anchor investors, a lock-in of 90 days from the date of allotment will apply for issues opening on or after April 1, 2022, Sebi said in a press release. The existing lock-in of 30 days will continue for the remaining 50 percent.The board tightened the amount that companies can raise for the future, as yet unidentified acquisitions or investment targets. In the case of book-built issues, a minimum price band of at least 105 percent of the floor price will apply for all issues opening on or after notification.NII allocation normsThe regulator revised the allocation norms for non-institutional investors. From April 1, 2022, for book-built issues, two-thirds of the portion available for NIIs will be reserved for those applying for more than Rs 10 lakh of shares, while the remainder will be for those bidding for shares worth Rs 2 lakh to Rs 10 lakh.Mutual fund regulationThe board made it mandatory for trustees of a mutual fund to obtain the consent of a majority of unitholders for winding up a scheme. Sebi approved a mandate for mutual funds to follow the Indian Accounting Standard from FY24.Superior voting rights, SSE framework, silver ETFs - September 28Sebi proposed to ease rules related to superior voting rights, approved the creation of the Social Stock Exchange, and introduced silver exchange-traded funds, among other decisions.Superior voting rights Sebi said at its meeting that promoters with a net worth of up to Rs 1,000 crore could have superior voting rights in their companies, increasing the threshold from Rs 500 crore.Social stock exchangeThe board approved the creation of the SSE for fundraising by social enterprises. The SSE framework was developed based on the recommendations of a working group and a technical group constituted by the market regulator.Silver exchange-traded fundsThe board approved the amendment to the SEBI (Mutual Funds) Regulations, 1996, to allow silver ETFs under safeguards similar to those governing gold ETFs under the existing regulatory framework.FPI constituentsTo facilitate investment in the Indian securities markets through the foreign portfolio investment (FPI) route, the board permitted resident Indians (other than individuals) to become constituents of FPIs that are registered as alternative investment funds in International Financial Services Centres.IPO reforms, relaxation of disclosure requirements - August 6 Sebi decided to reform IPO rules and simplify requirements for group company disclosures.IPO reforms Sebi amended the lock-in period for an issue that involves an offer for sale or financing, other than for capital expenditure for a project. The minimum promoters’ contribution of 20 percent, in such cases, should be locked in for 18 months from the date of allotment in the IPO and follow-on public offer. Currently, the lock-in period is three years.In all these cases, the promoter shareholding above the minimum contribution will be locked in for six months instead of the existing one year. Sebi decided on several amendments in IPO norms, which it stated in a press release.Relaxed disclosure requirementsThe board approved ways to reduce disclosure requirements during an IPO. The measures include rationalising the definition of the promoter group where the promoter of the issuer company is a corporate body to exclude companies that have the same financial investors. The board agreed to shift from the concept of a promoter to ‘person in control’ or ‘controlling shareholders.’In addition, the disclosure requirements in the offer documents in respect of the issuer company’s group entities should be rationalised to exclude disclosure of the financials of the top 5 listed or unlisted group companies. These disclosures will continue to be made available on the website of the group companies.IDs, InvITs, REITs; insider trading informant rewards - June 29The regulator amended regulations for independent directors, changed the criteria for infrastructure investment trusts (InvITs) and real estate investment trusts (REITs), and increased rewards for insider trading informants.Appointing IDsAppointments, reappointments, and removal of independent directors must be made through a special resolution of shareholders for all listed entities. Sebi elaborated on the appointment process of independent directors to be followed by the nomination and remuneration committee, ordering a modification in the committee. Several amendments mentioned in Sebi’s press release come into effect from January 1, 2022.Relaxed REIT, InvIT rulesThe board revised the minimum application value to be in the range of Rs 10,000-15,000 from Rs 1 lakh and its multiples previously and revised the trading lot to one unit for REITs and InvITS. It also relaxed norms for unlisted REITs and InvITs tapping the bond market.Accredited investorsThe board approved a proposal to introduce a framework for accredited investors, a class of investors who may be considered well-informed or well-advised about investment products.Informant rewardsThe regulator increased the reward amount payable to informants under insider-trading rules to Rs 10 crore from Rs 1 crore, a much-awaited decision as the earlier amount appeared ineffective.Delisting rules, sustainability reporting, startups - March 25Sebi approved a raft of measures, including making delisting of shares more transparent and efficient, requiring companies to disclose sustainability issues, and making the public offering of startups easier.The regulator mandated the public disclosure of analyst calls, quick reporting of earnings, and expanded the requirement of setting up a risk management committee to the top 1,000 listed companies by market capitalisation from 500 listed entities previously.Delisting normsUnder the new norms, a promoter or acquirer must disclose the intention to delist by making an initial public announcement. It introduced and revised timelines for various activities involved in delisting, the introduction of a committee of independent directors for recommendations, and the specification of an indicative delisting price not less than the floor price.Innovators growthSebi cut the period for issuers to have 25 percent of pre-issue capital held by eligible investors from two years to one year, which was significant demand from startups.Reclassification of promotersThe Sebi board acted on a long-pending demand of corporate houses. It changed the requirement of approval from shareholders in cases where the promoter seeking reclassification holds less than 1 percent of the shares, subject to the promoter not being in control.The board introduced new requirements for sustainability reporting by listed entities. The new report will be called the Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report and will replace the previous Business Responsibility Report. The new report will lay emphasis on quantifiable metrics, which allow for easy measurement and comparability across companies, sectors and time periods.This report by Moneycontrol has details on Sebi’s decisions at the meeting.Ease for large issues - February 17Sebi took significant decisions at its first board meeting for 2021. Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman customarily addressed the board after the budget presentation in Parliament.Change in IPO normsThe regulator approved changes in the norms for IPOs to allow a smaller float for large companies. The board recommended that for issuers with a post-issue market capital exceeding Rs 1 lakh crore, the requirement of the minimum public offer will be cut from 10 percent of the post-issue market capital to Rs 10,000 crore plus 5 percent of the incremental amount beyond Rs 1 lakh crore.These issuers must achieve at least 10 percent public shareholding in two years and at least 25 percent public shareholding within five years of listing.As a result of amendments in IPO norms, the dilution requirement for post-issue capitalisation of over Rs 4,000 crore was lowered to 5 percent from 10 percent previously, as per Sebi’s press release.Ease of doing businessTo promote ease of doing business, Sebi approved the merger of the Regulatory Fee on Stock Exchanges Regulations, 2006, with the Securities Contracts (Regulation) (Stock Exchanges and Clearing Corporations) Regulations, 2018.Amending the regulations, the board noted that the post-graduate programme in equity markets of not less than one year offered by NISM is an eligible qualification for portfolio managers, investment advisers, and research analysts.Budget announcements such as gold spot exchange, investor charter, and securities code were also discussed.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/the-year-in-review-sebis-notable-decisions-in-2021-7887121.html,IPO,"It also relaxed norms for unlisted REITs and InvITs tapping the bond market.Accredited investorsThe board approved a proposal to introduce a framework for accredited investors, a class of investors who may be considered well-informed or well-advised about investment products.Informant rewardsThe regulator increased the reward amount payable to informants under insider-trading rules to Rs 10 crore from Rs 1 crore, a much-awaited decision as the earlier amount appeared ineffective.Delisting rules, sustainability reporting, startups - March 25Sebi approved a raft of measures, including making delisting of shares more transparent and efficient, requiring companies to disclose sustainability issues, and making the public offering of startups easier.The regulator mandated the public disclosure of analyst calls, quick reporting of earnings, and expanded the requirement of setting up a risk management committee to the top 1,000 listed companies by market capitalisation from 500 listed entities previously.Delisting normsUnder the new norms, a promoter or acquirer must disclose the intention to delist by making an initial public announcement.The board recommended that for issuers with a post-issue market capital exceeding Rs 1 lakh crore, the requirement of the minimum public offer will be cut from 10 percent of the post-issue market capital to Rs 10,000 crore plus 5 percent of the incremental amount beyond Rs 1 lakh crore.These issuers must achieve at least 10 percent public shareholding in two years and at least 25 percent public shareholding within five years of listing.As a result of amendments in IPO norms, the dilution requirement for post-issue capitalisation of over Rs 4,000 crore was lowered to 5 percent from 10 percent previously, as per Sebi’s press release.Ease of doing businessTo promote ease of doing business, Sebi approved the merger of the Regulatory Fee on Stock Exchanges Regulations, 2006, with the Securities Contracts (Regulation) (Stock Exchanges and Clearing Corporations) Regulations, 2018.Amending the regulations, the board noted that the post-graduate programme in equity markets of not less than one year offered by NISM is an eligible qualification for portfolio managers, investment advisers, and research analysts.Budget announcements such as gold spot exchange, investor charter, and securities code were also discussed.","['Accredited investorsThe board', 'IPO', 'the Regulatory Fee on Stock Exchanges Regulations', 'the Securities Contracts (Regulation', 'NISM']",[]

SEBI’s new IPO norms to help improve transparency ,30 December,"                        The Indian primary market had its best year ever in 2021, with record fundraising and many oversubscription records broken. However, the limelight was stolen by the new-age companies who managed to raise funds from the public. Their success in raising funds has been said to mark the coming of age of Indian markets to fund start-ups that are not yet profitable.

Challenges confronting the boom in India’s initial public offerings,30 December,"It’s not easy to get bank loans on reasonable terms or raise funds from venture capitalists and angel investors so many small and medium enterprises (SMEs) are seeking to raise money through initial public offerings (IPOs) to expand.  Buoyancy in the primary market in the past months, with many issues getting subscribed multiple times the size of the offerings and bumper listings, has enthused small businesses to consider going public.  Most of them are unaware of what it will take to list on the stock exchanges. Many cannot afford the expenses of listing even on dedicated and low-cost platforms for SMEs on the Bombay Stock Exchange and the National Stock Exchange.   Yet, many enterprising entrepreneurs are finding ways to overcome barriers to taking their businesses public. The fundraising plans of these entities are modest, they are looking to raise less than Rs 10 crore. Self Storage India CEO Manjali Khosla is among the many entrepreneurs diligently understanding the process involved in listing on small companies’ exchanges. Her company specialises in renting out small, private dedicated storage rooms. ""I have been doing quite a bit of homework and been meeting two merchant bankers. While information about SME IPO was not complex, the internal preparation work is quite a lot especially when one wants to have good reception in the market."" Khosla hopes to take her venture to the market in July. She sees enough demand in the market to grow her business two-three times. But finding enough capital has been a problem. So far, she has reached out to her family when she needed to invest more money in her business. Credibility  Khosla has understood some of the benefits of listing her venture. One of the upsides she expects from the listing is a rise in the credibility of her business, which she expects will give her an edge over competitors. Co-founder of Jaipur-based Healing Crystals Abhishek Sharma has hired merchant bankers and is in the process of preparing the prospectus for the listing. ""We aim to go public in the first quarter of the next year. We have not finalised the size of the issue but I am hopeful of raising around Rs. 5-8 crore,"" said Sharma. He had approached banks and angel investors for funding, but now thinks a public listing the right solution for his company. ""A listing would not help us with the capital for growth but will also help our brand image and visibility,” said Sharma Ahmedabad-based cashew processor Fortune Exports hopes to make its market debut in March-April 2022. Its founder Vimal Mishra tried borrowing from banks, which demanded large collateral that he could not provide. He explored other options for raising capita and found no satisfactory offers.   “I work in a highly capital-intensive industry and everything depends on the raw material. To survive in this industry, I need capital to maintain 6-8 months’ worth of raw material stocks. That would give me an edge,” said Mishra.  IPO frenzy in the making? Capital markets have been an insignificant source of funding for the MSME sector. Less than 1% of the equity capital funds of such business were raised from the market. The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and capital crunch faced by these companies are bringing about a change. “Following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the necessity and importance of equity funding has been understood by the MSME founders,” said Ajay Thakur, head of BSE SME, the platform for listing and trading in stocks of small and medium-sized businesses run by BSE Ltd. “We expect the number of listings on the platform to be much higher this fiscal. About 50 MSMEs have filed for approval and 25 have already been listed. On average, 30-40 companies list annually,” Thakur added.  SME IPOs had taken a hit last year with only 20 prospectuses filed in 2020-21. Amit Kumar, founder and CEO of MSMEx, an MSME education and growth consulting services platform said that there is renewed enthusiasm among MSME entrepreneurs to understand the possibilities of listing.  Yet, most MSMEs do not have the money to finance their IPOs, he added. An IPO can cost up to Rs. 45-50 lakh. This problem is being overcome by roping in institutional investors who are given a share in equity in exchange for funds to cover the cost. Khosla, Sharma and Mishra are members of the SME cohort with MSMEx.  Challenges, constraints    Making available a dedicated platform for small and medium businesses and keeping compliance requirements light may not be enough to encourage SMEs to tap the capital market. The SME IPO system needs to rethink and stakeholders should make the ecosystem more conducive for SME listings, Indorient Financial Services executive director & compliance officer Ivor Misquith said.  Indorient had a lead managed for an SME IPO in 2020. ""There should be a separate window for SMEs to bring out their IPOs.""   If there is a mainboard IPO happening concurrently with an SME IPO, a lot of retail investors will put money in the mainboard IPO, Misquith said.  That affects the subscription levels of the IPO of a small company. Therefore a separate window to avoid this conflict between the mainboard and the SME IPOs is needed, he explained.  The minimum lot size of Rs 1 lakh is another impediment to the success of an SME IPO, Misquith said. This is way higher than the minimum lot size of Rs 10,000-15,0000 for a mainboard IPO.  “Why would an investor block Rs. 1 lakh instead of putting Rs.15k in a mainboard IPO?” he asked.  Investors would prefer to invest Rs 15,000 each in different IPOs on the mainboard rather than invest Rs. 1 lakh on an SME IPO.

Why are firms choosing SPACs over IPOs?,28 December," Ed-tech firm Byju's may choose a SPAC or a special purpose acquisition company to go public, instead of a domestic listing. SPACs raise capital through an IPO and then scout for a company to acquire; the merger makes the latter a listed company by default. When the Indian IPO market is booming, why choose the SPAC way? For one, an IPO takes at least 15-18 months to complete, while SPAC margers can be wrapped up in 3-6 months. The deal price can also be established upfront, which is a relief in a volatile market. The company can also save on capital and effort, since it doesn't have to take out investor roadshows.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/startup/why-are-firms-choosing-spacs-over-ipos-7863501.html,IPO,"Ed-tech firm Byju's may choose a SPAC or a special purpose acquisition company to go public, instead of a domestic listing.SPACs raise capital through an IPO and then scout for a company to acquire; the merger makes the latter a listed company by default.","[""Byju's"", 'SPAC', 'IPO']",[]
IPO fireworks in New Year too; companies likely to garner Rs 1.5 lakh crore through initial share sales,28 December,"Initial share sales are set to dazzle the Dalal Street in 2022 too as companies are expected to garner up to Rs 1.5 lakh crore in the New Year, continuing with the bullish momentum after 2021 turned out to be the best IPO year in two decades for the Indian market.Excessive liquidity and increased retail investor participation ensured a persistent euphoria in the Initial Public Offer (IPO) space wherein companies mopped up more than Rs 1.2 lakh crore this year even as pandemic gloom shadowed the broader economy.In 2022, the higher amount of funds through the primary market will be largely driven by the mega IPO of state-owned Life Insurance Corp (LIC).Besides, a lot of new-age digital players are expected to explore initial share sales.All said, the possible impact of the coronavirus pandemic, especially with the emergence of Omicron, might still be a cause for concern.Venkatraghavan S, Managing Director and Head - Equity Capital Markets at Equirus, said that with interest rates set to move up, there might be some dampening of the current frenzy.""But, we don't expect a wholesale collapse of the primary market for equities. Any pandemic-related alarms could of course throw a spanner in the works"".For calendar year 2022, he said that since LIC listing is also expected, it is anticipated that the amount raised through IPOs will be in the range of Rs 1.25 to 1.5 lakh crore.Sandeep Bhardwaj, CEO of Retail at IIFL Securities, said 2022 might see new record funds raised through IPOs and added that LIC is likely to be the mother of all IPOs in India and will also significantly attract global investors' attention.India recorded the ""best IPO year"" in two decades with proceeds worth over USD 16.9 billion in 2021 as ample global liquidity, robust earnings and increased retail participation bolstered the initial share sales space, according to a report by global consultancy EY.Prashant Singhal, Emerging Markets, Technology, Media, Telecom (TMT) Leader at EY, said this year has seen some of the best performances in the Indian IPO market with new age tech companies leading the way.According to him, good traction was also seen in diversified and industrial products and consumer products and retail sectors.""Investor sentiment remains upbeat as 2021 comes to a close with strong domestic and global demand and significant momentum going into 2022"".On the flip side, there are voices who feel that 2022 might not be as buoyant as this year and there are also concerns about the pandemic situation.A lot will depend on market sentiments next year as the uncertainty due to the new COVID variant still looms large on the markets and economy, Piyush Nagda, Head-Investment Product at Prabhudas Lilladher, said.Ricky Kirpalani, Lead Sponsor at First Water Capital Fund (AIF), said that 2022 may not be as buoyant as 2021 for IPO markets, given how some recent large public issue like Paytm have performed post-listing.This year, as many as 63 companies have floated their IPOs to raise Rs 1.2 lakh crore, an analysis of data with the exchanges showed.This was way higher than Rs 26,611 crore raised by 15 companies through initial share sales in the entire 2020 and nearly double the previous best of Rs 68,827 crore by 36 companies in 2017.Apart from the 63 firms, PowerGrid InvIT (Infrastructure Investment Trust) mopped up Rs 7,735 crore through its IPO while Brookfield India Real Estate Trust raised Rs 3,800 crore through REIT (Real Estate Investment Trust).Companies took advantage of the bullish trends in the stock market as well as excessive liquidity in the system.Also, IPOs of new age technology companies, robust retail participation, and huge listing gains added to the glitter on the Dalal Street amid the broader economy slowly on the recovery path.""The rally in global equity markets, low interest rates and abundant liquidity due to the easy monetary policies of global central banks has aided in impressive fund raising through the IPO,"" Sameer Kaul, MD and CEO of TrustPlutus Wealth (India), said.Samir Sheth, Partner and Head of Deal Advisory Services at BDO India, said a bunch of new age digital companies got listed in 2021 providing not only an opportunity for retail investors to invest but also an opportunity for some of the early-stage investors to make an exit.For instance, food delivery company Zomato's IPO was subscribed by over 38 times.Many other technology-led businesses, including One97 Communications (Paytm), FSN E-Commerce Ventures (Nykaa) and PB Fintech (Policybazaar) took the IPO route of raising funds.Prateek Singh, Founder and CEO of LearnApp.com, said tech companies now want to expand globally for which they require capital and that capital is being raised through the IPO route.The largest IPOs were the One97 Communications that had an issue size of Rs 18,300 crore, followed by Zomato at over Rs 9,300 crore.The average issue size was a high Rs 1,884 crore this year.IPOs of more than a dozen companies, including Data Patterns (India) Ltd, Tega Industries, Go Fashion (India) Ltd Latent View Analytics, MTAR Technologies, Devyani International, Rolex Rings, Tatva Chintan Pharma Chem and Nazara Technologies, got subscribed over 100 times.The year witnessed spectacular response from retail investors and the average number of applications from retail was 14.36 lakh, in comparison to 12.77 lakh in 2020 and 4.05 lakh in 2019.2021 also saw majority of the IPOs opening with a premium over the issue price suggesting strong investors appetite.Paras Defense and Space Technologies, Clean Science and Technology, Macrotech Developers, Laxmi Organic Industries, MTAR Technologies, Easy Trip Planners, which got listed in this year, are trading above their issue price, giving smart returns in the range of 156 to 292 per cent, since listing.""Due to the vibrancy in both the private and public markets, there is an increased play of investing on the private side and exiting on the public side as can be seen with a bevy of PE-backed IPOs in recent times (over 70 per cent of IPOs this year have been PE backed),"" Satyen Shah, MD & Head of Investment Banking at Edelweiss Financial Services, said.Going into 2022, Eklavya, founder of trading platform Recur Club, said that as long as

"Indian fintech: After record funding in 2021, what does 2022 hold?",28 December,"A fintech acquiring a sinking bank, PayU’s most expensive acquisition in India, record funding and a ‘blessing’ of Unicorns. For Indian fintechs, that was 2021 -- a year of many firsts.In 2021, Indians saw, more clearly than ever, how fintechs are changing access to financial services – be it payments, neobanks, lending, insurance, stockbroking… you name it. New trends took shape, new words became part of our day-to-day vocabulary.The fact that Indians are moving online for their financial needs faster than ever made investors pour money into the sector. A total of $9 billion was raised by fintechs in 2021, according to data by Traxcn.As various fintech verticals grew their offerings and user base, regulators took notice and proposed regulations across sectors. Come 2022, we can expect digital lending and neobanks to be regulated, as per recommendations by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and Niti Aayog. But according to industry leaders, the collaboration between banks and these fintechs will not slow down anytime soon.Also Read: FPIs have pumped in Rs 79,851 crore in IPOs this yearHere’s a look at the trends that shaped the Indian fintech space in 2021 and what is in store for the coming year.BharatPe and Centrum’s takeover of PMC BankUntil not very long ago, fintechs were seen as an extension of banking, aiding the growth of banking services and providing digital infrastructure for the same. The tables turned this year when payments and financial services startup BharatPe joined hands with Centrum Financial Services to acquire the beleaguered Punjab and Maharashtra Cooperative (PMC) bank, putting to rest two years of worries for depositors.RBI granted the consortium a Small Finance Bank (SFB) licence to begin operations as a bank. During the announcement in June 2021, BharatPe’s founder and CEO Ashneer Grover said that both companies will be investing $250-$300 million to bring services back on their feet.Many are seeing this as a change in how the regulator views fintechs. According to Jaikrishnan G, Partner, Financial Services Consulting, Grant Thornton Bharat, this acquisition is a milestone for digital players with banking aspirations.“BharatPe, a fintech with a three-year legacy partnering with an NBFC (Centrum) to acquire a banking licence with plans to bail out a troubled co-operative bank, is an exceptional example of how the financial services industry has matured in the country. The regulator and the public have understood the importance of the role of fintechs,” he said.The bank is expected to be operational in 2022.PayU goes shoppingIn its largest acquisition in India till date, the Prosus-owned payment fintech PayU acquired another major payment gateway, BillDesk, for $4.7 billion. The deal brings together PayU’s fast-growing payment gateway business with BillDesk’s well-established gateway, which is the preferred service provider for utilities, financial services and government payments.The acquisition will bring the combined entity’s Total Payment Volumes (TPV) to $147 billion, as per PayU’s investor presentation that quoted data from FY21 details. Of this, BillDesk makes up $92 billion in TPV. TPV refers to the total value of payments and reversals executed on a payments platform.PayU’s aim behind this acquisition was to grow the scale of its business, and that is probably the way ahead for all fintechs.Post the deal, BillDesk founder MN Srinivasu had shared his views on fintechs in an interview with Moneycontrol. “This is a game of scale. From now on, it's going to be about how people scale and deliver. The advantage this combined platform has is that most other players in the market still have to figure out the right platform by which they can build sustainable models,” he said.Funding and IPOsA record year for fintech funding, fund inflows saw a growth of over 200 percent in 2021, compared to last year. Large deals were seen from early stage to late-stage rounds.According to Traxcn data, a record $9.03 billion was raised by Indian fintechs across 410 equity funding rounds in 2021, up from $2.83 billion across 303 rounds last year.Payments again topped the charts in attracting funds, with payment companies making up over $4.11 billion or 46 percent of the year’s fintech funds. They included large rounds by companies like Pine Labs ($700 million), Razorpay ($535 million), Cred ($547 million), among others.Funds worth $4.8 billion were raised by fintech unicorns, many of them growing their valuation by leaps and bounds in the year. Of the 43 startups that turned unicorns, 12 were from the fintech space. A unicorn is a privately held entity with a valuation of $1 billion or above.Pranav Pai, Founding Partner and Chief Investment Officer at 3one4 Capital, which is invested in fintechs Open and Jupiter, said that this funding momentum will help fintechs stay well-funded when the cycle turns and investment sentiment slows.“The fintech opportunity in India is much larger than people had assumed. If the customer base expands quickly, more companies can become larger in that space. Which means more equity will enter those companies. In terms of future funding, I don't think it will stop for fintechs,” Pai said.Pai also believes that with Paytm and PolicyBazaar going public this year and drawing attention, fintechs will be understood much better by prospective investors and the public at large.BNPL, neobanks to lead in 2022The fintech story is only expected to grow in the coming year. According to Grant Thornton Bharat’s Jaikrishnan, funding traction will continue across all categories. However, the focus is likely to be on lending and neobanks, with both new regulations and opportunities awaiting these startups.These fintechs also fill the key gaps of small-ticket credit requirements and access to online banking services, touting them as the fastest-growing verticals.Lizzie Chapman, co-founder and CEO of BNPL (buy now, pay later) startup ZestMoney, said: ""The world woke up to the potential of BNPL just 18 months back, but India has known this for a decade. We believe India will be the largest BNPL market in the world. There will be more market cap created in this segment in India than anywhere else in the world in the coming time. It will be an India category.""At the core of neo-banking and digital lending models like BNPL is the collaboration between banks, NBFCs and fintechs. Over the past two years, banks have been increasingly tying up with fintechs to expand their customer base.“Year 2022 will see more collaboration between fintechs and banks as they roll out innovative products. India has one of the most stable regulatory regimes in the world and with banks and fintechs coming together, we can address the diversity of demand and drive financial inclusion for the country,"" Chapman added.Consolidation and acquisitions, such as those by PayU and BillDesk, are seen by many as the next step of change in the Indian fintech space. With a multitude of startups vying for a pie of every fintech vertical, it is inevitable that only the best and the largest will eventually survive, and will acquire many smaller players on the way.The gates have also opened for major fintechs that have plans to go public. Taking advantage of the bullish scenario, players like Pine Labs and Digit Insurance may go for IPOs in 2022.However, what is it that fintechs must keep in mind as governments and regulators increase scrutiny over the sector?According to 3one4 Capital’s Pai, 2022 will be a year when not only legacy financial institutions have to ask themselves what the future holds but startups will have to ask the existential question as well.""Fintechs that pretend they are financial institutions will suffer, because they are not. And financial institutions that pretend they are fintechs will also suffer. It is a marriage; it is a partnership. One side claiming they can do everything will struggle,"" he said.A fintech acquiring a sinking bank, PayU’s most expensive acquisition in India, record funding and a ‘blessing’ of Unicorns.

2021 in Review | How markets moved to major domestic and global events,27 December,"After an extremely rough 2020, the world pinned hopes on 2021, but as they say, be careful what you wish for, it only got worse.From the deadly second wave of COVID-19 that decimated India’s healthcare system and laid bare its inadequacies for the world to see to the Republic Day and the Lakhimpur Kheri violence, Indians have not had it easy in 2021.Yet, markets continued to soldier on.Despite the volatility and a 9 percent fall from the all-time high, benchmark index Nifty50 is up more than 21 percent from the close last year, so far.Read all our year-end 2021 stories hereEasy money policies by central banks, increase in retail participation, the promise of economic growth and mass vaccination against COVID have been some of the factors that drove the market rally.Let’s check out the major events of 2021 and how the markets reacted, or did not react to them.Covid pandemic continued to be the centre-stageIt was a happy new year for the market when the Centre approved Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin and Serum Institute-manufactured AstraZeneca’s Covishield vaccines on January 2 for emergency use. This was followed by a mass vaccination programme, initially only for healthcare workers, but progressed at an undesirable pace.Then the deadly second wave came in April, which battered the healthcare system until June. From thousands of deaths due to shortage of oxygen in hospitals to bodies floating on the banks of the Ganga, it was a grim situation that left no one untouched.It was a choppy period for the market as well, and yet, the Nifty50 gained 5 percent during the two months of April and May.Also read: Five dividend yields funds that gave 38-51% returns over the past one yearThings calmed down and experts believed we were entering a stage of “endemicity”, learning to live with the virus, and marking new vaccination milestones as India reached the one billion vaccination mark on October 21. However, the Omicron variant was detected in India in December, which brought uncertainty to the market.Farm laws, resolute protesters, ensuing violence, and eventual rollback In December, farmers ended the biggest protest that the Independent India has seen so far, 15 months after the three contentious farm laws were passed in the Parliament in September 2020.Even though it has been called a victory for the farmers, it came at a cost. On January 26, thousands of protestors clashed with the police during a tractor parade. With some protestors climbing poles at a section of the Red Fort and some ransacking public property, the police resorted to teargas shelling and lathicharge.Also read: What is in store for Indian equities in 2022?The movement also saw unconstitutional arrests of activists and supporters. While the Karnal incident in August became infamous because of an IAS officer, caught on camera, instructing policemen to beat up protesting farmers and not let anyone breach the security cordon without “a broken head”, the Lakhimpur Kheri incident in October left eight people dead and several injured.However, the market did not pay heed to any of the developments, deeming them political even as some experts suggested it could hurt the FII sentiment as investors would see the rollback of the laws as a failure in implementing reforms.Homecoming of Air India and Centre’s monetisation planA few months after the finance minister announced LIC’s initial public offer would be launched this financial year itself, the ministry laid out a plan to monetise assets worth Rs 6 trillion in the next four years.The National Monetisation Pipeline will include Indian Railways assets worth Rs 1.52 trillion, national highways assets worth Rs 1.6 trillion, power transmission assets worth Rs 45,000 crore, warehousing assets worth Rs 28,900 crore, and more.But the bigger news that buoyed sentiment was in October, when the government successfully found a “home” for the debt-laden national carrier Air India in Tata Sons. The group received a nod to acquire 100 percent stake in Air India, the airline it founded nearly 90 years ago, for Rs 18,000 crore. (Image: News18 Creative)The coal crisisOctober also saw a severe shortage of coal, with several states facing power outages for hours every day. While politicians, central ministers and chief ministers started playing the blame game, no one took any responsibility to resolve the issue.Reasons such as excessive rainfall, international price rise, COVID-19 pandemic, less production, transportation issues, including freight rates and high consumption, were cited as the reason for the coal shortage. In short, power generation took a hit and people suffered.Also read: 2021, the risk-taking investor’s year: Demat accounts and NFO collections set new recordsAs we moved into November, the crisis eased as supplies of coal began to rise again after the governments pressed miners to rapidly boost output and lifted imports, allowing power plants and major industrial consumers to start rebuilding stockpiles.Central banks turn hawkish, rush to rein in inflationThe end of 2021 saw major central banks turning hawkish, and indicating that rate hikes were in the offing, which would put an end to the easy money era that markets were riding on for the past two years.While the US Federal Reserve said it was doubling down on its stimulus taper, the Bank of England actually raised interest rates by 25 bps. Both the central banks cited rising cost of employment or tight labour market conditions for the change in stance.Now, the market has been anticipating liquidity tightening for a while, which is why foreign investors have continuously been pulling out from emerging markets this year.Add to that Omicron concerns, and the market saw a bloodbath on December 20. Since April, FIIs have been net buyers only in September in the equity cash market.In November, they net sold Rs 39,900 crore, as per the provisional data, while as of December 23, they net sold over Rs 32,000 crore.Also read: Start-up Street: 2022 set to be another year of frenetic private equityA record-breaking yearThe year 2021 has been nothing less than historic. It not only saw massive FII selling, but domestic investors remained net buyers from March in the cash market.Moreover, the market saw record systematic-investment-planning contribution this year, with Rs 11,005 crore in November alone, as per data from the Association of Mutual Funds in India.The markets also hit a lifetime high in October, with the Nifty50 touching 18,604.45 points and the Sensex hitting 62,245.53 points.Banking on the market exuberance throughout the year, the primary market saw more than 65 companies launching their public offers. Companies have raised a record Rs 1,31,416 crore from the primary market in a year, according to data from Chittorgarh, which tracks IPOs.Also read: SOS call answered, now telecom sector to ring in 5G in 2022The year also saw the largest IPO in One97 Communcations, the parent of digital payments giant Paytm, which raised Rs 18,300 crore.Not just that, India’s foreign exchange reserves hit a record high of $642.43 billion in the week ended September 3, according to data from the Reserve Bank of India. This was after another week of record high, when the central bank reported forex reserves had hit $633.56 billion in August.However, the reserves have since fallen, and were at $635.82 billion during the week ended December 10.And in positive news for the government at a time when funds are stretched, we also saw record GST collections this year. In April, the government collected Rs 1,39,708 crore in GST revenues, the highest ever for any month. After the collections fell for the next few months, November saw the second highest collections since the implementation of GST, at Rs 1,31,526 crore.As the year of frenetic movements across all economic parameters draws to an end, India awaits a Union Budget that would ease its frayed nerves and drying coffers.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/2021-in-review-how-markets-moved-to-major-domestic-and-global-events-7861681.html,IPO,"After an extremely rough 2020, the world pinned hopes on 2021, but as they say, be careful what you wish for, it only got worse.From the deadly second wave of COVID-19 that decimated India’s healthcare system and laid bare its inadequacies for the world to see to the Republic Day and the Lakhimpur Kheri violence, Indians have not had it easy in 2021.Yet, markets continued to soldier on.Despite the volatility and a 9 percent fall from the all-time high, benchmark index Nifty50 is up more than 21 percent from the close last year, so far.Read all our year-end 2021 stories hereEasy money policies by central banks, increase in retail participation, the promise of economic growth and mass vaccination against COVID have been some of the factors that drove the market rally.Let’s check out the major events of 2021 and how the markets reacted, or did not react to them.Covid pandemic continued to be the centre-stageIt was a happy new year for the market when the Centre approved Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin and Serum Institute-manufactured AstraZeneca’s Covishield vaccines on January 2 for emergency use.While the Karnal incident in August became infamous because of an IAS officer, caught on camera, instructing policemen to beat up protesting farmers and not let anyone breach the security cordon without “a broken head”, the Lakhimpur Kheri incident in October left eight people dead and several injured.However, the market did not pay heed to any of the developments, deeming them political even as some experts suggested it could hurt the FII sentiment as investors would see the rollback of the laws as a failure in implementing reforms.Homecoming of Air India and Centre’s monetisation planA few months after the finance minister announced LIC’s initial public offer would be launched this financial year itself, the ministry laid out a plan to monetise assets worth Rs 6 trillion in the next four years.The National Monetisation Pipeline will include Indian Railways assets worth Rs 1.52 trillion, national highways assets worth Rs 1.6 trillion, power transmission assets worth Rs 45,000 crore, warehousing assets worth Rs 28,900 crore, and more.But the bigger news that buoyed sentiment was in October, when the government successfully found a “home” for the debt-laden national carrier Air India in Tata Sons.","['COVID-19', 'Nifty50', 'COVID', 'Centre', 'Bharat', 'Serum Institute', 'AstraZeneca', 'Covishield', 'Karnal', 'IAS', 'the Lakhimpur Kheri', 'FII', 'Air India', 'LIC', 'The National Monetisation Pipeline', 'Indian Railways', 'Rs 1.52 trillion', 'Air India', 'Tata Sons']","['$642.43 billion', '$633.56 billion', '$635.82 billion']"
IPO-bound firms see correction in unlisted market,27 December,"After many companies failed to deliver positive returns on their stock market debut, several IPO-bound companies’ shares have dropped in the so-called unlisted market, where securities are bought and sold before they are officially traded.For instance, shares of PharmEasy parent API Holdings Ltd which filed draft initial public offering (IPO) papers with Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) in November, have lost nearly 21% from their October highs.The stock is currently trading at Rs 107 a share, down from Rs 135 earlier.Likewise, Le Travenues Technology Ltd, the operator of travel platform ixigo, has declined 19% from its October high in the unlisted market.The stock is currently trading at Rs 195, down from Rs 240 a share.

Recently, many IPOs that failed to perform on listing day also dampened sentiment among investors,” an analyst tracking the unlisted market said on condition of anonymity.Domestic as well as global equities markets are in a correction phase amid worries on inflation and spreading cases of Omicron, the latest variant of Covid-19. Continued selling by foreign investors in the domestic market have also worried investors.The Sensex hit an all-time high of 62,245.43 on October 19 while the Nifty 50 climbed to a record 18,604.45 on that day. Since then, the Sensex has lost 5,121.43 points, or 8.23 percent, while the Nifty eased 1,601.45 points, or 8.61 percent.Profit booking “The new entrant in unlisted space, API Holdings, which is being traded with heavy volumes, has cooled off. Also, stocks like Reliance Retail, HDB Financial Services, and Chennai Super Kings which are all-time favourite stocks of the unlisted market, have slumped from recent highs. This fall can be attributed to profit booking because most of these counters had significantly outperformed the market in a very short span” said Manan Doshi, co-founder of unlistedarena.com, which buys and sells shares of unlisted companies.In 2021, 63 Indian corporate entities have raised Rs 1.19 trillion via IPOs with most firms reporting healthy gains on debut. A few firms recently listed with negative or flat returns which analysts say was due to stretched valuations and lack of meaningful fundamentals. This led huge losses for high networth investors.Metro Brands Ltd, Shriram Properties Ltd and RateGain Travel Technologies Ltd debuted at a nearly 20% discount while Anand Rathi Wealth Ltd, Star Health and Allied Insurance Co. Ltd, Tarsons Products Ltd and Sapphire Foods India Ltd received a tepid response on their market debut.

"The IPO Year: Fundraising by India Inc at record high of Rs 1,18,704 Crore in 2021",23 December,"On several counts, 2021 has been a truly exceptional and record breaking year for the Indian IPO market.The fervour was so much during the course of the year, that even certain M&A scenarios gradually morphed into IPO mandates as promoters couldn't resist the mouth-watering valuations in the public markets.Sample this headline stat for starters -63 Indian corporates raised an all-time high Rs 1,18,704 crores through main board IPOs in 2021, according to data compiled by PRIME Database Group.This record amount was nearly 4.5 times the Rs. 26,613 crores raised through 15 IPOs in 2020 and almost twice the previous best year of 2017, in which Rs. 68,827 crore was raised via the listing route.IPOs from new age loss-making technology startups, strong retail participation and huge listing gains were the key highlights of the year, according to Pranav Haldea, Managing Director, PRIME Database Group.So what led to the frenzy?Dharmesh Mehta, Founder, DAM Capital says India went through a transformation phase post the outbreak of Covid-19, which benefitted tech companies as new business models evolved and prospered.""India followed the global trend and the stock markets did exceedingly well hence record retail money came to the markets,"" said Mehta.He further added, ""I always believe supply brings in demand so the IPO supply led to unprecedented demand as everyone had cash but lack of avenues to invest, hence IPOs got record subscriptions.""The largest IPO in 2021, which was also the largest IPO ever in the history of the Indian IPO market, was from One 97 Communications (Paytm) forRs 18,300 crore. The average deal size was a high Rs 1,884 crore.Retail investor euphoriaThe average number of applications from the retail segment was 14.36 lakh, in comparison to 12.77 lakh in 2020 and 4.05 lakh in 2019. The highest number of applications from retail in 2021 was received by Glenmark Life Sciences (33.95 lakhs) followed by Devyani International (32.67 lakhs) and Latent View (31.87 lakhs).Its all about the gains!According to PRIME Database, of the 58 IPOs which have got listed thus far, 34 gave a return of over 10 percent (based on closing price on listing date). Sigachi Industries gave a return of 270 percent followed by Paras Defence (185 percent) and Latent View (148 percent). Forty of the 58 IPOs are trading above the issue price (closing price of December 22, 2021). The average listing gain was 32 percent, in comparison to 44 percent in 2020 and 19 percent in 2019.The IPO split: primary vs secondaryTwenty five out of the 63 IPOs that hit the market had a prior PE/VC investment. Offers for sale by such PE/VC investors at Rs 24,106 crore accounted for 20 percent of the total IPO amount. Offers for sale by promoters at Rs 31,704 crore accounted for a further 27 percent of the IPO amount.Interestingly, the amount of fresh capital raised in IPOs in 2021 stood at Rs 43,324 crore, which was greater than the last 8 years combined.2021 also saw another record, in terms of the number of filings with SEBI. As many as 115 companies filed their offer document with SEBI for approval. According to Haldea, to put this in context, 2019 and 2020 cumulatively had a total of merely 50 filings.IPO market: The road aheadPRIME Database believes the domestic IPO pipeline remains strong with 35 companies holding SEBI approval proposing to raise roughly Rs 50,000 crore and another 33 companies awaiting SEBI approval to raise about Rs 60,000 crore. This excludes the much anticipated mega IPO of LIC, which is expected to be launched in this fiscal according to the government.However, some market observers believe that the dismal debut of Paytm followed by the tepid response to the Star Health Insurance IPO ( both big issues) have made investors cautious.They add that going ahead, investor sentiment in the secondary market would also be impacted by the rapid spread of the Omicron variant of Covid-19 and the possibility of global central banks withdrawing monetary stimulus earlier than expected.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/the-ipo-year-fundraising-by-india-inc-at-record-high-of-rs-118704-crore-in-2021-7859261.html,IPO,"On several counts, 2021 has been a truly exceptional and record breaking year for the Indian IPO market.The fervour was so much during the course of the year, that even certain M&A scenarios gradually morphed into IPO mandates as promoters couldn't resist the mouth-watering valuations in the public markets.Sample this headline stat for starters -63 Indian corporates raised an all-time high Rs 1,18,704 crores through main board IPOs in 2021, according to data compiled by PRIME Database Group.This record amount was nearly 4.5 times the Rs.This excludes the much anticipated mega IPO of LIC, which is expected to be launched in this fiscal according to the government.However, some market observers believe that the dismal debut of Paytm followed by the tepid response to the Star Health Insurance IPO ( both big issues) have made investors cautious.They add that going ahead, investor sentiment in the secondary market would also be impacted by the rapid spread of the Omicron variant of Covid-19 and the possibility of global central banks withdrawing monetary stimulus earlier than expected.","['IPO', 'IPO', 'PRIME Database Group', 'IPO', 'LIC', 'the Star Health Insurance IPO', 'Omicron']",['One 97 Communications']
