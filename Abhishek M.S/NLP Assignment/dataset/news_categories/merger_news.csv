Lifelong Group-led consortium snaps up GoMechanic,29 March,"A consortium led by auto component maker Lifelong Group on Wednesday said it has bought beleaguered car workshop and auto spare parts platform GoMechanic, nearly two months after the latter’s co-founders admitted to falsifying figures to investors.The financial details of the deal were not disclosed.Lifelong Group will become the majority shareholder under Gurugram-based car care startup Servizzy, marking a new phase for the GoMechanic business, it said in a statement.The acquisition of GoMechanic business aligns with the group's strategic vision of synergizing its proven expertise in the automotive industry, said Lifelong, which caters to major players such as Hero Moto Corp, General Motors, Arvin Meritor, and Stanley Black & Decker.  The sale was initiated by the board and shareholders of GoMechanic, with support from venture debt investor Stride Ventures, in response to recent financial difficulties at the Gurgaon-based company. The Servizzy consortium, led by the Lifelong Group, emerged as the strongest bidder in the sale process, based on the core value proposition offered by GoMechanic.The acquisition will enable the preservation of the ecosystem at large, and the continued livelihood of GoMechanic's employees, LifeLong pointed out in a press statement.   Founded in 2016, GoMechanic connects car owners with repair service providers locally to provide a range of services, including regular maintenance, repairs, and car cleaning. It had 1,100-1,200 employees before it laid off nearly 70% of its staff.  Late last year, Japanese marquee investor SoftBank found irregularities in the five-year-old firm’s growth and revenue numbers while inspecting financial accounts ahead of a potential investment. The startup was looking to raise fresh capital from SoftBank and Khazanah Nasional at a valuation of over $800 million.  The founders of GoMechanic admitted to falsifying figures in January. Following this, GoMechanic’s investors ordered a forensic audit of its accounts by EY to examine claims of fraud and financial misreporting. “We are deeply distressed by the fact that the founders knowingly misstated facts, including but not limited to the inflation of revenue, which the founders have acknowledged. All of this was kept from investors,” major investors of the company said in a joint statement. GoMechanic was last valued at $285 million after raising $42 million, according to estimates by VCCedge, the data intelligence platform of VCCircle. It counts Sequoia Capital, Tiger Global Management, Orios Venture Partners, Brand Capital, Chiratae Ventures and Elina Investments as its investors. Sequoia Capital owned the largest stake at 26.89%, followed by Orios Venture Partners at 17.1%, Tiger Global at 10.03%, and other investors with a combined 11.2% stake. Orios has already written down its investment in the startup.Post admitting to the financial irregularities, GoMechanic continued operations across 800 workshops and serviced 30,000 vehicles in January, Lifelong added.Share article on",https://www.vccircle.com//lifelonggroup-led-consortium-snaps-up-gomechanic,Merger/Acquisition,"A consortium led by auto component maker Lifelong Group on Wednesday said it has bought beleaguered car workshop and auto spare parts platform GoMechanic, nearly two months after the latter’s co-founders admitted to falsifying figures to investors.The financial details of the deal were not disclosed.Lifelong Group will become the majority shareholder under Gurugram-based car care startup Servizzy, marking a new phase for the GoMechanic business, it said in a statement.The acquisition of GoMechanic business aligns with the group's strategic vision of synergizing its proven expertise in the automotive industry, said Lifelong, which caters to major players such as Hero Moto Corp, General Motors, Arvin Meritor, and Stanley Black & Decker.The Servizzy consortium, led by the Lifelong Group, emerged as the strongest bidder in the sale process, based on the core value proposition offered by GoMechanic.The acquisition will enable the preservation of the ecosystem at large, and the continued livelihood of GoMechanic's employees, LifeLong pointed out in a press statement.","['Lifelong Group', 'GoMechanic', 'Lifelong Group', 'Gurugram', 'GoMechanic', 'GoMechanic', 'Hero Moto Corp', 'General Motors', 'Stanley Black & Decker', 'the Lifelong Group', 'GoMechanic', 'GoMechanic']","['over $800 million', '$285 million', '$42 million']"
Kae Capital-backed LoanTap snaps up Unofin to boost healthcare lending play,29 March,"Pune-based digital lending platform LoanTap Financial Technologies Pvt Ltd on Wednesday said it has bought healthcare-focussed fintech firm Unofin in an effort to ramp up its exposure in the healthcare financing space. The financial details of the transaction were not disclosed. Loantap, which counts Kae Capital, India Quotient, Lighthouse Canton, Avaana Capital, 3one4 capital and Tuscan ventures, among others as its investors, said that through this buyout it aims to offer affordable financing options for healthcare needs to individuals without any insurance coverage or those who may need more funds beyond insurance capping.  LoanTap further said that it plans to expand its reach in the rapidly growing healthcare sector in India by leveraging the fintech healthcare expertise of Unofin, which has already serviced over 12,000 customers with Rs 120 crore of gross loan disbursals so far.  Unofin has tie-ups with 1600 healthcare service providers in seven cities, including Delhi NCR, Jaipur and Chandigarh. Earlier, it had raised capital from LV Angel Fund, First Cheque, family offices and other HNI investors. It counts LoanTap, Faircent and Aditya Birla Capital as its lending partners.   LoanTap’s cofounder and chief executive officer Satyam Kumar said that the acquisition is a strategic move for the company to expand its product offerings and tap into the immense potential of the healthcare sector.  “We believe that healthcare financing is a niche segment with tremendous growth potential. Unofin's deep understanding of the industry will help us create innovative solutions that cater to the unique needs of healthcare professionals and institutions,"" Kumar added. The acquisition will also enable LoanTap to leverage Unofin's strong relationships with leading hospitals, clinics, and medical equipment suppliers to offer customized financing solutions to these entities. It plans to introduce a range of products such as equipment financing, working capital loans, and term loans to healthcare professionals and institutions, the statement said. LoanTap was founded by Satyam Kumar and Vikas Kumar in 2016. The non-bank financial institution (NBFC) offers loans and overdraft products to salaried professionals with earnings of Rs 30,000 and above. It also offers credit to lenders, anchors, and merchants.  It has raised close to Rs 170 crore in equity and Rs 23.8 crore in venture debt so far.  The platform pits against the likes of PaySense and EarlySalary.  LoanTap’s acquisition of Unofin comes at a time when the digital lending space is witnessing a slew of consolidations as raising fresh capital gets tougher with the uncertain macroeconomic conditions.  For instance, last month, Mumbai-based Lendingkart acquired retail lender Upwards Fintech to offer personal loans to small businesses. Also, in November, Tiger Global-backed fintech unicorn Cred bought lending-based big data company CreditVidya in a cash and stock deal. The same month also saw Walmart-backed digital payments and financial services provider PhonePe acquiring buy-now-pay-later (BNPL) fintech startup ZestMoney.Share article on",https://www.vccircle.com//kaecapital-backed-loantap-snaps-up-unofin-to-boost-healthcare-lending-play,Merger/Acquisition,"LoanTap further said that it plans to expand its reach in the rapidly growing healthcare sector in India by leveraging the fintech healthcare expertise of Unofin, which has already serviced over 12,000 customers with Rs 120 crore of gross loan disbursals so far.LoanTap’s cofounder and chief executive officer Satyam Kumar said that the acquisition is a strategic move for the company to expand its product offerings and tap into the immense potential of the healthcare sector.","['LoanTap', 'LoanTap']",[]

Why dealmakers expect M&A activity to pick up despite facing 'brick wall',24 March,"Some of the most prominent rainmakers in the world of corporate mergers struck a note of optimism about dealmaking on Thursday, even as they acknowledged a volatile economic backdrop had significantly impacted M&A activity.The banking crisis that has emerged in the wake of Silicon Valley Bank's failure has shaken boardroom confidence already dented by fears over an economic slowdown, investment bankers and deal lawyers told the Tulane Corporate Law Institute conference in New Orleans.""There is a brick wall in front of M&A activity,"" said Anu Aiyengar, global head of M&A at JPMorgan Chase & Co.""When you look at what's happening in China, geopolitical tensions, interest rates, bank runs, liquidity crisis, increased chances of recession - throw everything together and it seems quite formidable.""With financing having dried up for private equity-backed leveraged buyouts, buyers will have no option but to put up a lot of equity to get deals done in the near term, the conference participants said.""We are in for choppiness,"" said Scott Barshay, chair of the corporate department at law firm Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP. ""There is a giant struggle right now. And it's a giant struggle because there's a lot of dry powder for the equity part of private equity deals. What there's not is a lot of leverage for the leverage part of the leveraged buyout.""M&A volumes declined considerably last year amid fears of faster interest rate hikes, possible recession, weaker credit markets and a tumbling stock market.The total value of deals last year fell 37% from a record high in 2021 to $3.61 trillion, according to Refinitiv data. That is the biggest year-over-year percentage drop since 2001 when the U.S. economy fell into recession.Global dealmaking this year through mid-March has tumbled nearly 50% in terms of dollar volumes from a year ago and is off nearly 30% in terms of the number of deals being done, according to Refinitiv.Dealmakers, however, said they expect the impact from the banking crisis on broader M&A activity to be contained, as most of the worst affected regional banks are not major advisers or lenders on deals.The technology sector remains the best hunting ground for corporate acquirers or private equity financiers, deal advisors said.""There is really no part of the world that allows you to have an organic growth trajectory that lets you meet the market possible for trading at a premium valuation, which means you have to look at inorganic growth opportunities,"" said Aiyengar.Dealmakers also predicted an increase in unsolicited approaches from cash-flush buyers who are taking advantage of a drop in valuations of potential targets, who are now more willing to entertain bids than they were a few months ago.Increased regulatory uncertainty due to greater scrutiny on deals from antitrust regulators also is likely to impede the speed of deals getting across the finish line, with dealmakers criticizing the adversarial stance taken by the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice.""In this very narrow context of who's going to be running the DOJ antitrust division and the FTC in the future, our business will be a lot better if it's somebody else,"" said Barshay.Share article on",https://www.vccircle.com//whydealmakersexpect-m-a-activity-to-pick-up-despite-facing-brick-wall,Merger/Acquisition,"That is the biggest year-over-year percentage drop since 2001 when the U.S. economy fell into recession.Global dealmaking this year through mid-March has tumbled nearly 50% in terms of dollar volumes from a year ago and is off nearly 30% in terms of the number of deals being done, according to Refinitiv.Dealmakers, however, said they expect the impact from the banking crisis on broader M&A activity to be contained, as most of the worst affected regional banks are not major advisers or lenders on deals.The technology sector remains the best hunting ground for corporate acquirers or private equity financiers, deal advisors said.""There is really no part of the world that allows you to have an organic growth trajectory that lets you meet the market possible for trading at a premium valuation, which means you have to look at inorganic growth opportunities,"" said Aiyengar.Dealmakers also predicted an increase in unsolicited approaches from cash-flush buyers who are taking advantage of a drop in valuations of potential targets, who are now more willing to entertain bids than they were a few months ago.Increased regulatory uncertainty due to greater scrutiny on deals from antitrust regulators also is likely to impede the speed of deals getting across the finish line, with dealmakers criticizing the adversarial stance taken by the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice.","['Refinitiv', 'Aiyengar', 'the Federal Trade Commission', 'the Department of Justice']",['$3.61 trillion']

Shobitam makes maiden bet with House of Blouse,20 February,"Ethnic wear brand Shobitam has marked its first acquisition with apparel brand House of Blouse to strengthen its product offerings. However, the financial details of the deal were not disclosed.  Founded by Aparna Thyagarajan and Ambika Thyagarajan in 2019, Seattle-based Shobitam claims to be a growing online direct-to-consumer (D2C) platform for ethnic fashion, serving in over 40 countries. Its offerings include sarees and accessories, among others.   “This supplements and complements our customer experience greatly and enables us to diversify our product category by adding more unique products,” said Thyagarajan. Shobitam has raised Rs 12 crore (around $1.5 million) from Mumbai-based Hearth Ventures and angel investor Girish Laxman till date. Meanwhile, House of Blouse sells sarees and tailored blouses through its website and claims to ship worldwide.   “We look forward to expanding our products outside of blouses and penetrate into different countries to which Shobitam has a solid customer base already,” said Roopa Reddy, co-founder and creative head at House of Blouse. Lately, the D2C space also garnered the attention of large conglomerates, VCCircle had earlier reported.  According to investment bankers and investors, large conglomerates are finding it easier to buy out D2C brands amid a funding crunch for unprofitable startups. The trend has been rising over the last few years and will sharpen in 2023, especially for startups requiring capital to survive.  Among other developments in the apparel industry, D2C fashion brand D’chica raised Rs 1.62 crore late last month from revenue-based financier Velocity to scale its hiring and marketing plans. The brand generates revenue from its core offerings—innerwear--along with a fashion line of sportswear, loungewear and footwear.  Another popular apparel and footwear brand, Bewakoof Brands Pvt. Ltd, handed a majority stake to TMRW, a wholly-owned unit of Aditya Birla Fashion Retail Ltd. for about Rs 200 crore. Bewakoof, in December, also said that it is aiming to break even by the next financial year, and achieve 10% Ebitda margin in the next five years.  Share article on",https://www.vccircle.com//shobitammakes-maiden-bet-with-house-of-blouse,Merger/Acquisition,"“We look forward to expanding our products outside of blouses and penetrate into different countries to which Shobitam has a solid customer base already,” said Roopa Reddy, co-founder and creative head at House of Blouse.Among other developments in the apparel industry, D2C fashion brand D’chica raised Rs 1.62 crore late last month from revenue-based financier Velocity to scale its hiring and marketing plans.","['Shobitam', 'House of Blouse', 'D2C']",['around $1.5 million']

‘India's M&A activity to remain buoyant amid global slump',31 January,"Bucking the global trend, the merger and acquisition (M&A) activity in India will continue to grow at its fast-paced trajectory this year, buoyed by the availability of attractive assets and a positive sentiment as an investment destination, as per a report by global consultancy firm Bain & Company. “Close to 65% of executives we have surveyed said they expect M&A activity to stay strong in 2023 and this is significantly higher than the global average of 37%,” said Vikram Chandreshekhar, partner at Bain & Company.  While, India’s M&A deal value recorded a 139% surge last year but it has seen a 36% and 22% decline globally and in the Asia-Pacific region respectively. The findings also underline availability of 53% more attractive assets in India against global markets.  “The willingness of sellers to exit at current valuation multiples primarily qualifies companies as high-quality assets,” Chandreshekhar said.  In an interaction with VCCircle, he also noted that sellers in India are looking to make complete exits from their businesses, allowing for a more seamless asset transfer.  As for multinational corporations, there is improved optimism to invest in India as a long-term investment market. The opportunity is specifically attractive to global firms looking to diversify their supply chains, the report further added.  “India stands to benefit from recent supply chain disruptions. The shift is fueling deals in areas such as active pharmaceutical ingredients, specialty chemicals, and contract manufacturing,” it said. Global trade has been hit by supply chain disruptions caused by Covid-19 with China being one of the worst-hit nations, as well as the by geopolitical tensions erupted by the Russia-Ukraine war.  According the Reserve Bank of India’s data, aggregate foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows rose to more than $80 billion in the last two fiscal years, through financial years (FY) 2020-2022, from an annual average of $60 billion in the three years before the pandemic (FY 2017-2019).   Other factors contributing to the robust outlook include ample private equity (PE) dry powder to deploy, strong balance sheets, confidence among investors to make bold bets on newer sources of growth, particularly amid an economic downturn.    “We are seeing strong M&A activity across sectors, including financial services, utilities, manufacturing, and healthcare. Environmental, social, and governance (ESG) is a new theme and India is emerging as a hotspot for renewables,” said Karan Singh, managing partner, Bain & Company.   Among other key themes, startups operating in the consumer tech, fintech, and edtech sectors witnessed the maximum consolidation activity in India in the last few years, the report said.  “Fast growing insurgents are aggressively buying start-ups. Start-ups that raised funds before 2022 are now utilizing war chests to acquire companies that have been unable to raise funds and are running out of runway,” it added.Funding in Indian startups dipped by 35% (up to 5 December), to $24.7 billion, as compared to the previous year, dragged by a decline in late-stage funding, according to a report by market intelligence platform Traxcn. Some implications to this fast-paced M&A deal activity include talent retention, as 38% of India-based executives say they experience such challenges, against a global average of 30%, and combining both ESG and digital capabilities in dealmaking to drive multiple M&A deals as these will be key themes going forward.  Share article on",https://www.vccircle.com//indias-m-a-activity-to-remain-buoyant-amid-global-slump,Merger/Acquisition,"Bucking the global trend, the merger and acquisition (M&A) activity in India will continue to grow at its fast-paced trajectory this year, buoyed by the availability of attractive assets and a positive sentiment as an investment destination, as per a report by global consultancy firm Bain & Company.Start-ups that raised funds before 2022 are now utilizing war chests to acquire companies that have been unable to raise funds and are running out of runway,” it added.Funding in Indian startups dipped by 35% (up to 5 December), to $24.7 billion, as compared to the previous year, dragged by a decline in late-stage funding, according to a report by market intelligence platform Traxcn.",['Bain & Company'],"['more than $80 billion', '$60 billion', '$24.7 billion']"

JetSynthesys acquires former Twitter India head's creator monetization platform,24 January,"Gaming and entertainment firm JetSynthesys has acquired a majority stake in Fanory, a content monetization platform for creators, co-founded by former Twitter India head Manish Maheshwari, for an undisclosed sum. As part of the acquisition, Maheshwari will take charge as president, corporate level at JetSynthesys. After leading Twitter India for over two years, Maheshwari moved to Twitter US as a senior director in August 2021 before moving on in January 2022 to start an ed-tech startup called Invact Metaversity. Maheshwari exited the startup in May to start Fanory, which is now out of stealth mode and available for download on the Play Store and App Store. “The idea behind Fanory is to provide a monetization platform to creators. It gives them a personalized app through which they can provide exclusive content to their superfans and directly charge them money and keep most of that money,” said Maheshwari. Creators can use in-app tokens on Fanory to pay for premium experience and content shared by creators they follow. They can engage with them directly through messages, video calls, and live sessions. Maheshwari points out that social media platforms give creators visibility, distribution, and audience. “What they don’t give them is that consistent set of revenues and monetization. They prioritize user acquisition and engagement to whom they can serve the advertisement. Any money they pass on to the creator is usually a very small and minuscule amount of it,” he added. Fanory will continue to exist as an independent brand led by Maheshwari within the JetSynthesys ecosystem, said Rajan Navani, founder and CEO of JetSynthesys. “The social media creators market has grown exponentially, and we see this continuing for the foreseeable future. Fanory’s model is beneficial for creators. It compensates them for their hard work and creativity. With Manish by our side, we look forward to exploring this new avenue and entrenching ourselves deeper into the digital entertainment realm,” said Navani. He added that this merger aligns with some of the other investments that his firm has been making towards larger strategic goals with Gen-Z audiences in mind. For instance, last September, JetSynthesys acquired Bengaluru-based metaverse startup Metaphy Labs for an undisclosed sum. The firm has earmarked $50 million for metaverse investments over the next three years. Further, Maheshwari said that creators can set the prices they want from followers. The majority of the money will go directly to the creators and Fanory will take a small cut of it. In addition to monetization, there can also be brand collaborations. Maheshwari also added that NFTs present an exciting opportunity. “Owning digital rights is going to be big. But we have to see how the ecosystem evolves and what use cases emerge there,” he added.Share article on",https://www.vccircle.com//jetsynthesysacquires-former-twitter-india-head-s-creator-monetization-platform,Merger/Acquisition,"Maheshwari exited the startup in May to start Fanory, which is now out of stealth mode and available for download on the Play Store and App Store.The majority of the money will go directly to the creators and Fanory will take a small cut of it.",[],['$50 million']

Goat Brand acquires PE-backed Chumbak,12 January,"Direct-to-consumer (D2C) brand aggregator Goat Brand Labs has acquired home and lifestyle brand Chumbak for an undisclosed amount. The company has also bought four more brands, which will be disclosed in the coming days, it said in a statement on Thursday. Rishi Vasude, co-founder and chief executive of Goat Brand, said in an interview that the other acquisitions are in the fashion and beauty business. He declined to elaborate. Vasude said the founders of Chumbak will continue to run and scale the brand. The deal saw the exit of existing investors of Chumbak--Matrix Partners, Gaja Capital, and SeedFund. A person aware of the matter said Goat Brand has acquired up a 77% stake in Chumbak and that it typically buys brands at 1-1.5 multiples. The latest buyout has expanded Tiger Global-backed Goat Brand’s portfolio to 20 brands. The company aims to grow Chumbak into a ₹500 crore brand in the next three years. Chumbak was founded by Vivek Prabhakar and Shubhra Chadda in 2010. It runs retail stores in shopping centres and offers products such as culturally-inspired cups, plates, purses, watches, home decor items, and other accessories. “This partnership is the perfect recipe to grow the brand exponentially by expanding its global reach, both online and offline, through a tech and data-driven approach,” said Vasudev in a statement. Last year, Goat Brand acquired multiple D2C brands including The Label Life, a celebrity-styled brand, and trueBrowns, a premium ethnic wear brand. According to Goat Brand, both the brands have grown tenfold since their partnership. The addition of the five new brands is aimed at further strengthening the company’s portfolio of fast-growing fashion and lifestyle brands. Goat Brand also counts Flipkart, Mayfield, Winter Capital, Nordstar, and Better Capital among its backers. The company had raised $50 million in a fundraising round in June last year. Prior to this, it had raised $36 million in July 2021.   Goat Brand follows a model similar to that of US-based Thrasio, which acquires third-party private label brands on Amazon. Apart from Goat Brand, other Indian companies which adopted the Thrasio-style business model category and raised significant venture capital funding last year include FirstCry-backed GlobalBees and Powerhouse91, 10club and Evenflow. Share article on",https://www.vccircle.com//tigerglobal-backed-goat-brand-acquires-chumbak,Merger/Acquisition,"Rishi Vasude, co-founder and chief executive of Goat Brand, said in an interview that the other acquisitions are in the fashion and beauty business.“This partnership is the perfect recipe to grow the brand exponentially by expanding its global reach, both online and offline, through a tech and data-driven approach,” said Vasudev in a statement.","['Rishi Vasude', 'Goat Brand']","['500', '$50 million', '$36 million']"

Zetwerk makes fourth acquisition this year,30 November,"Business-to-business (B2B) manufacturing services marketplace Zetwerk has acquired manufacturing services company Unimacts for $39 million (around Rs 315 crore) in a cash and stock deal, the company announced on Wednesday.    The acquisition aims to position Zetwerk for additional expansion and diversification, providing immediate access to marquee solar and wind-power customers. Additionally, Zetwerk will gain access to the consolidated demand Unimacts has generated thus far, which will be serviced by the company’s global supply base.    Zetwerk will also benefit Unimacts' expertise in renewable energy manufacturing.   The Unimacts team including Matthew Arnold, CEO; Andrew Woglom, CFO and Alan Hays, COO, along with the team at Unimacts, will be joining Zetwerk, which will bring the global employee count to 1,900.   “This acquisition will expand our presence in North America and position Zetwerk for additional expansion in the coming months. We are excited to usher in a new era of intelligent manufacturing for our customers, partners, and our planet,” said Amrit Acharya, co-founder, CEO, Zetwerk.   In an interaction with Mint last year, founder and CEO Amrit Acharya spoke about taking the inorganic growth route with 2-5 acquisitions.    In June this year, Zetwerk acquired three companies for Rs 100 crore (around $13 million) in a bid to strengthen its industrial verticals in the oil and gas, aerospace, defence and infrastructure component segments. Zetwerk acquired Pinaka Aerospace Solutions, bought a majority stake in Sharp Tanks and a 100% stake in the Wardha fabrication unit of listed company Wheels India.   Matthew Arnold, CEO, Unimacts added, “Partnering with Zetwerk will allow us to accelerate our growth and global reach and provide more solutions to our customers. With the recent $1.2 trillion infrastructure bill and Inflation Reduction Act, the renewable energy sectors of solar and wind in the US are poised for significant growth. These have been the primary end markets for Unimacts over the last five years.  Founded in 2018 by Acharya, Srinath Ramakkrushnan, Rahul Sharma and Vishal Chaudhary, Zetwerk helps small and medium enterprises translate their digital designs into physical products. It operates in more than 25 industry segments.   In December, Zetwerk raised its Series F funding round of $200 million from investors led by D1 Capital and Greenoaks, valuing it at $2.7 billion. The four-year-old company’s previous $150 million funding round helped it enter the unicorn club or startups that are valued at more than a billion dollars.   The company offers manufacturing services to sectors such as consumer goods, apparel, defence, space and aerospace.   Zetwerk saw its revenue triple to ₹949 crore for the financial year ended 31 March 2021 and is likely to have posted similar growth in FY22, according to Acharya. Currently, Zetwerk gets around 85% of its business from the Indian market and about 10% from its international customers.   Business-to-business manufacturing companies such as InfraMarket.com, OfBusiness and Zetwerk have seen robust growth in the last two to three years, and with increasing stress on make in India, the companies have benefited from India Inc.’s drive to manufacture locally.  Share article on",https://www.vccircle.com//zetwerkmakes-fourth-acquisition-this-year,Merger/Acquisition,"In June this year, Zetwerk acquired three companies for Rs 100 crore (around $13 million) in a bid to strengthen its industrial verticals in the oil and gas, aerospace, defence and infrastructure component segments.Business-to-business manufacturing companies such as InfraMarket.com, OfBusiness and Zetwerk have seen robust growth in the last two to three years, and with increasing stress on make in India, the companies have benefited from India Inc.’s drive to manufacture locally.","['InfraMarket.com', 'India Inc.’s']","['$39 million', 'around $13 million', '$1.2 trillion', '$200 million', '$2.7 billion', '$150 million', 'more than a billion dollars']"
Tata in talks to acquire Wistron's India unit: Report,30 November,"Tata Group is in discussions with Taipei's Wistron Corp, one of Apple Inc's top vendors in India, to buy its manufacturing facility in Karnataka for up to ₹5,000 crore ($612.6 million), suggested a report by The Economic Times.Wistron began making iPhones in India in 2017, after years of efforts by Apple to add manufacturing capabilities in the country. The Taipei-based company currently assembles iPhones at its plant in the state of Karnataka in southern India.In September, Bloomberg News had reported that Tata Group is in talks with the Taiwanese supplier to Apple Inc. to establish electronics manufacturing joint venture in India, seeking to assemble iPhones in the South Asian country.If successful, the pact could make Tata the first Indian company to build iPhones, which are currently mainly assembled by Taiwanese manufacturing giants like Wistron and Foxconn Technology Group in China and India.An Indian company making iPhones would be a massive boost for the country’s effort to challenge China, whose dominance in electronics manufacturing has been jeopardized by rolling Covid lockdowns and political tensions with the US. It could also persuade other global electronics brands to consider assembly in India to reduce their reliance on China at a time of increasing geopolitical risks.Tata Group Chairman Natarajan Chandrasekaran has said electronics and high-tech manufacturing are key focus areas for the company, India’s top conglomerate with revenue of about $128 billion. Industries such as software, steel and cars account for much of Tata’s business, but it has taken early steps in the smartphone supply chain by starting to manufacture iPhone chassis components in southern India.For Wistron’s Indian business, struggling with losses, a pact with Tata would give it a formidable local partner with deep pockets. Tata’s reach also spans automobiles including electric vehicles, an area many of the world’s tech giants are eager to expand in, as per the Bloomberg report.Wistron InfoComm also recently emerged as the single biggest investor under the government’s production-linked incentives (PLI) scheme for large-scale electronics manufacturing, bringing in ₹1,250 crore, followed by the local units of Samsung and Foxconn, investing ₹900 crore and ₹650 crore, respectively.

Cred to acquire Matrix-backed lending enabler CreditVidya,29 November,"Tiger Global-backed fintech unicorn Cred, on Tuesday said it will acquire 100% stake in lending-based big data company CreditVidya for an undisclosed amount, in a mix of cash and stock.CreditVidya’s acquisition comes about two months after the Kunal Shah-led unicorn said it is looking to pick a minority stake in its Mumbai-based lending partner LiquiLoans. Last year, it acquired expense management startup Happay in December and liquor delivery startup HipBar Pvt. Ltd in October. “Expanding access to credit is a key driver for financial progress. CreditVidya's patented tech stack uncovers signals of trust among under-served cohorts,” Shah said in a statement. The acquisition allows Cred to expand its customer base and ecosystem as CreditVidya, which caters to customers who do not have a credit score. “We’ve invested in building products that bring financial services to credit under-served Indians through our partners, transforming how risk is assessed and trust measured to drive financial inclusion,” Abhishek Agarwal, co-founder and chief executive of CreditVidya, said. Hyderabad-based CreditVidya was founded in 2012 by Agarwal and Rajiv Raj. It offers a software-as-a-service platform that allows businesses to embed customised credit products. Since inception, the company has raised about $10 million in funding, and was last valued at $30 million. “In our next phase of our growth, as we build brand and scale distribution, we are excited to learn from the CRED team,” Agarwal added. As a part of the acquisition, the two firms will continue to operate independently. CreditVidya’s 200+ team members will get all the benefits extended to Cred team members, including its employee stock-option program.Founded by serial entrepreneur Kunal Shah in 2018, Bengaluru-based Cred started as an app that lets users pay credit card bills and rewards them in the form of “Cred” coins, which can be redeemed across many partner businesses. Since then, the firm has diversified into lending and e-commerce. Last month, the company launched ‘Scan and Pay’ under the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform, foraying into the wider payments business, to compete with the likes of PhonePe, GooglePay (Gpay), Paytm and government-backed Bhim UPI mobile applications, among others. It is backed by marquee investors such as Singaporean wealth fund GIC, Tiger Global, FalconEdge, Sofina Ventures, Insight Partners, Coatue and Dragoneer among others.Share article on",https://www.vccircle.com//credto-acquire-matrix-backed-lending-enabler-creditvidya,Merger/Acquisition,"Tiger Global-backed fintech unicorn Cred, on Tuesday said it will acquire 100% stake in lending-based big data company CreditVidya for an undisclosed amount, in a mix of cash and stock.CreditVidya’s acquisition comes about two months after the Kunal Shah-led unicorn said it is looking to pick a minority stake in its Mumbai-based lending partner LiquiLoans.CreditVidya’s 200+ team members will get all the benefits extended to Cred team members, including its employee stock-option program.Founded by serial entrepreneur Kunal Shah in 2018, Bengaluru-based Cred started as an app that lets users pay credit card bills and rewards them in the form of “Cred” coins, which can be redeemed across many partner businesses.","['Cred', 'CreditVidya', 'CreditVidya', 'LiquiLoans', 'CreditVidya', 'Cred']","['about $10 million', '$30 million']"

CCI gives nod to Zee-Sony merger with modifications,04 October,"The Competition Commission of India (CCI) on Tuesday approved the merger of Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd with Sony Pictures Networks India Pvt. Ltd. and Bangla Entertainment Pvt. Ltd, both part of the Sony Group Corp., accepting the modifications proposed by the companies to the deal they had announced last December.The transaction entails the amalgamation of Zee and Bangla Entertainment Pvt. Ltd, engaged in acquiring rights for motion pictures and other content into Culver Max Entertainment Pvt. Ltd, part of the Sony Group. CCI stated that Culver Max Entertainment has film, sports and kids channels in India and global markets. In India, it reaches over 700 million viewers, the antitrust regulator said.Without referring to the deal size, the competition watchdog said the $10 billion deal was in the nature of acquisition and amalgamation covered under CCI’s merger regulation threshold. Shardul Amarchand Mangaldas & Co., which represented Sony Pictures Networks India (SPN), said in a statement the company is now known as Culver Max Entertainment Pvt. Ltd.“We are delighted to receive CCI approvals to merge ZEEL into SPN. We will now await the remaining regulatory approvals to finally launch the newly merged company. The merged company will create extraordinary value for Indian consumers and eventually lead the consumer transition from traditional pay TV into the digital future,"" SPN said in a statement.The modification to the transaction approved by the CCI involves Zee excluding a major general entertainment channel from the transaction, said a person privy to the development. “CCI has accepted the voluntary remedy proposed by the companies,"" said the person, adding that it may involve either selling the channel in question or shutting it down.The move seeks to alleviate CCI’s concern that India’s largest media merger may give Zee-Sony unprecedented pricing power, which may hurt the prospects of other TV channels in the entertainment broadcasting industry. Though Zee did not share the remedies proposed to CCI, in a statement, it said: “In its official communication issued today, CCI has granted the approval in Phase-1 after evaluating the official legal and economic submissions made by the company. Considering the immense value that the proposed merger will generate for all its stakeholders, the company has offered the necessary remedies in accordance with the regulator’s guidelines. The detailed order is awaited. The approval from CCI is yet another positive step in the overall merger approval process.""In December 2021, the two companies said in a joint statement that the Japanese company would own a 50.86% stake in the merged entity, while Zee Entertainment’s promoters would own 3.99%. Zee Entertainment’s public shareholders will own the remaining 45.15%.As part of the deal, Zee founder Subhash Chandra’s son, Punit Goenka, will continue to be the combined company’s managing director and chief executive. In addition, Sony will pay a non-compete fee to promoters of Zee, which they will use to infuse primary equity capital into SPN, allowing them to buy shares of the company. The shares would eventually equal approximately 2.11% of the combined company’s shares.The statement then said most combined company directors will be nominated by Sony and will include current SPN managing director and CEO N.P. Singh. He will also assume a broader executive position at Sony Pictures Entertainment Inc. (SPE) as chairman of Sony Pictures India. Singh will report to Ravi Ahuja, Sony Pictures Entertainment’s chairman of Global Television Studios.Media industry analysts have pointed out that both firms complement each other. While Sony has a rich catalogue of sports and mainstream general entertainment channels (GECs), Zee has a great recall in the regional space. Both have very strong movie libraries, they said.Karan Taurani, an analyst at Elara Capital Ltd, said there is no major overlap between the two companies and no large flagship TV channel is expected to go off the air. “In terms of viewership share across genres, Zee and Sony are below 40% as a combined entity in all genres, except the movie genre, which is above 50%. Therefore, any indication of a flagship urban GEC channel shutting down by either of the broadcasters is a big risk as that drives a reasonable portion of revenues due to higher pricing,"" Taurani said.According to BARC data, Zee and Sony command a total TV viewership share of approximately 24% (as of FY22), which is slightly higher than that of Star (20%), and there is potential for this to move upwards and even breach levels of Star TV given the right strategy on content and distribution, Taurani added.“Multiple synergies exist for the merged entity, in the form of ad price hikes, cost savings on content, on the marketing and employee front and better bargaining power with which will lead to re-rating of valuation multiples on the TV segment,"" Taurani said.Share article on",https://www.vccircle.com//zeesony-unit-merger-gets-approval-from-competition-regulator,Merger/Acquisition,"The merged company will create extraordinary value for Indian consumers and eventually lead the consumer transition from traditional pay TV into the digital future,"" SPN said in a statement.The modification to the transaction approved by the CCI involves Zee excluding a major general entertainment channel from the transaction, said a person privy to the development.Therefore, any indication of a flagship urban GEC channel shutting down by either of the broadcasters is a big risk as that drives a reasonable portion of revenues due to higher pricing,"" Taurani said.According to BARC data, Zee and Sony command a total TV viewership share of approximately 24% (as of FY22), which is slightly higher than that of Star (20%), and there is potential for this to move upwards and even breach levels of Star TV given the right strategy on content and distribution, Taurani added.“Multiple synergies exist for the merged entity, in the form of ad price hikes, cost savings on content, on the marketing and employee front and better bargaining power with which will lead to re-rating of valuation multiples on the TV segment,"" Taurani said.Share article on","['SPN', 'CCI', 'GEC', 'BARC', 'Sony', 'Star TV']",['$10 billion']

NDTV promoters move SC against SAT's penalty order,21 September,"Promoters of New Delhi Television India Ltd. (NDTV), Prannoy Roy, Radhika Roy and RRPR Holdings, have filed an appeal in the Supreme Court against an order passed by the Securities Appellate Tribunal’s (SAT) in July asking them to pay ₹5 crore as penalty for alleged non-disclosure of loan agreements.In December 2020, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) had imposed a penalty of ₹25 crore on NDTV's promoters for alleged violation of non-disclosure of the loan agreement entered by them.SAT, setting aside the Sebi directional order, had reduced the penalty to ₹5 crore since the tribunal felt the penalty was “excessive"" in nature.The Roys are now challenging this SAT penalty order in the top court, NDTV informed the stock exchanges.While passing the order in December 2020, Sebi had said that the non-disclosed loan agreements had some clauses that had an adversarial effect on NDTV shareholders.A complaint was filed with the regulator in 2017 by Quantum Securities Pvt Ltd, an NDTV stakeholder. The loan arrangements with Vishvapradhan Commercial Pvt. Ltd (VCPL), was the subject of the dispute.Prannoy Roy, Radhika Roy and RRPR Holdings had failed to disclose material information to the shareholders of NDTV regarding the loan agreement entered with VCPL and, consequently, violated Sebi norms, the markets regulator had then said.According to the Sebi order, a loan agreement for ₹350 crore was struck with VCPL in 2009 to pay back a loan taken by NDTV from ICICI Bank, and a second loan agreement for ₹53.85 crore was signed with VCPL in January 2010. The markets regulator said that certain provisions in these loan arrangements had a significant impact on NDTV's ability to operate.Sebi had said, “Upon a scrutiny of various clauses of the loan agreement, the promoters had effectively transferred 30% of the shares of NDTV to VCPL and that the transactions have been deliberately structured as a loan transaction so as to conceal the said sale of 30% stake in NDTV"".According to the order , the regulator also found that the loan agreement structure was material and very sensitive information which was concealed from the minority shareholders, thereby inducing investors to trade in the shares of NDTV in ignorance regarding de facto control over NDTV by VCPL and, therefore such transaction has been made under the Prohibition of the Fraudulent & Unfair Trade Practises (PFUTP) Regulations.Meanwhile, in a surprise move on 23 August, the Adani group indirectly acquired a 29.18% stake in the broadcaster by purchasing VCPL, which owned convertible debentures in RRPR.

(NDTV), Prannoy Roy, Radhika Roy and RRPR Holdings, have filed an appeal in the Supreme Court against an order passed by the Securities Appellate Tribunal’s (SAT) in July asking them to pay ₹5 crore as penalty for alleged non-disclosure of loan agreements.In December 2020, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) had imposed a penalty of ₹25 crore on NDTV's promoters for alleged violation of non-disclosure of the loan agreement entered by them.SAT, setting aside the Sebi directional order, had reduced the penalty to ₹5 crore since the tribunal felt the penalty was “excessive"" in nature.The Roys are now challenging this SAT penalty order in the top court, NDTV informed the stock exchanges.While passing the order in December 2020, Sebi had said that the non-disclosed loan agreements had some clauses that had an adversarial effect on NDTV shareholders.A complaint was filed with the regulator in 2017 by Quantum Securities Pvt Ltd, an NDTV stakeholder.The markets regulator said that certain provisions in these loan arrangements had a significant impact on NDTV's ability to operate.Sebi had said, “Upon a scrutiny of various clauses of the loan agreement, the promoters had effectively transferred 30% of the shares of NDTV to VCPL and that the transactions have been deliberately structured as a loan transaction so as to conceal the said sale of 30% stake in NDTV"".According to the order , the regulator also found that the loan agreement structure was material and very sensitive information which was concealed from the minority shareholders, thereby inducing investors to trade in the shares of NDTV in ignorance regarding de facto control over NDTV by VCPL and, therefore such transaction has been made under the Prohibition of the Fraudulent & Unfair Trade Practises (PFUTP) Regulations.Meanwhile, in a surprise move on 23 August, the Adani group indirectly acquired a 29.18% stake in the broadcaster by purchasing VCPL, which owned convertible debentures in RRPR.","['Promoters of New Delhi Television India Ltd.', 'NDTV', 'RRPR Holdings', 'the Supreme Court', 'the Securities Appellate Tribunal’s', 'SAT', 'the Securities and Exchange Board of India', 'NDTV', 'SAT', 'SAT', 'NDTV', 'NDTV', 'Quantum Securities Pvt Ltd', 'NDTV', 'NDTV', 'NDTV', 'VCPL', 'NDTV""', 'NDTV', 'NDTV', 'VCPL', 'Adani', 'VCPL', 'RRPR']","['5', '25', '350', '53.85']"

Adobe to buy Figma for $20 bn to boost arsenal of collaborative design tools,15 September,"Adobe Inc will buy startup Figma for about $20 billion in its biggest deal, the Photoshop maker said on Thursday, bulking up on applications that support online collaboration amid a global shift to hybrid working.The cash-and-stock deal will give Adobe ownership of a company whose online collaborative platform for designs and brainstorming is used by firms ranging from Zoom Video Communications to AirBnB and Coinbase.""The combination of Adobe and Figma is transformational and will accelerate our vision for collaborative creativity,"" Adobe Chief Executive Shantanu Narayen said in a statement.Adobe has sharpened its focus on the collaboration tools space in recent years through acquisitions. It acquired work management platform Workfront in 2020 and cloud-based video collaboration platform Frame.io last year.Still, shares fell 13% in early trading. Some analysts pointed to the size of the deal that could require Adobe to raise debt. The company had cash and cash equivalents of $3.87 billion as of Sept. 2.""We're disappointed for the price paid for the company (Figma),"" said David Wagner, portfolio manager and equity analyst at Aptus Capital Advisors that owns a 1.5% stake in Adobe.""It tends to not be a great sign when a company has to acquire to defend share.

UpGrad in acquisition spree buys Centum Learning,15 September,"Upskilling unicorn upGrad Education Pvt. Ltd has bought New Delhi-based learning solutions platform Centum Learning in a share-swap deal, in its sixth acquisition this calendar year and the 11th so far. Financial details of the deal were not disclosed. Two people close to the development pegged the deal size at ₹120 crore (around $15 million).Centum Learning is a wholly owned unit of Bharti Enterprises Ltd, which is also the parent of telecom operator Bharti Airtel. Post the transaction, Bharti Enterprises and its affiliates will join upGrad’s cap table.The latest deal follows Mumbai-based upGrad’s acquisition of Noida-based online learning platform Exampur for an undisclosed amount in a cash-and-share swap deal in August. VCCircle reported in July that International Finance Corporation and IIFL-backed upGrad aims to add 3,000 employees this financial year besides making major acquisitions over 2-3 months. Led by Sanjay Bahl, Centum offers impact-based training to corporates as well as vocational and educational training to schools and college learners to make them either self-employed or meaningfully employed. With over 3,000 learning and development (L&D) specialists, the company claims to have trained more than 2 million people while also impacting over 400 corporates in India and Africa.Centum is targeting a revenue of ₹ 170 crore this financial year.“At Centum, we have been focused ontraining, skilling and upskilling for the last over 16 years now. We have put in years of hard work building a bespoke training and content portfolio that makes new-age learning more immersive and outcome-oriented for both corporates and individuals. Both upGrad and Centum are committed to drive in outcomes for their learners to create a scalable portfolio for continued results,” said Bahl.Upgrad was founded in 2015 by Ronnie Screwvala, Mayank Kumar and Phalgun Kompalli.“We have noticed that business-to-business (B2B) learning and development is a highly fragmented market. Therefore one way of winning the market was for us to consider M&A as a strategic way of expanding our presence in this domain. We are also in talks for some acquisitions at the international front also,” said Kumar. “Some of the newer businesses where we are looking to invest in includes study abroad. Focus will be the organic route and we expect to record gross revenue of $500 million this financial year,” he added.UpGrad has been bullish on its acquisition strategy to grow its user base and adjacencies in other verticals including test-prep through the acquisition of The Gate Academy and recruitment and staffing platform Rekrut in 2020. Meanwhile, the edtech industry, which boomed during the pandemic as teaching moved online, is facing a major funding crunch and moderation in valuations with the reopening of educational institutions. With a focus on conserving costs, several startups have resorted to mass layoffs and cutting discretionary spending. Edtech unicorns Byju’s, Unacademy, Vedantu and other smaller platforms such as Lido Learning, FrontRow, Udayy, and SuperLearn have either fired or asked hundreds of employees to leave as they shut some of their operations to cut costs.The broader startup ecosystem has also seen large layoffs with companies like FrontRow, Meesho, CityMall, Mobile Premier League, Cars24, MFine, Furlenco and Trell firing employees this year.Share article on",https://www.vccircle.com//upgradin-acquisition-spree-buys-centum-learning,Merger/Acquisition,"With over 3,000 learning and development (L&D) specialists, the company claims to have trained more than 2 million people while also impacting over 400 corporates in India and Africa.Centum is targeting a revenue of ₹ 170 crore this financial year.“At Centum, we have been focused ontraining, skilling and upskilling for the last over 16 years now.Focus will be the organic route and we expect to record gross revenue of $500 million this financial year,” he added.UpGrad has been bullish on its acquisition strategy to grow its user base and adjacencies in other verticals including test-prep through the acquisition of The Gate Academy and recruitment and staffing platform Rekrut in 2020.","['L&D', 'UpGrad', 'The Gate Academy']","['120', 'around $15 million).Centum', '170', '$500 million']"

"Sony, Zee offer concessions to ease CCI's worry over merger",12 September,"A unit of Sony Group and India's Zee Entertainment have proposed offering concessions such as pricing discounts to help ease concerns of the country's antitrust regulator over their merger, which will create a $10-billion TV behemoth, two sources told Reuters.The concessions are a bid to iron out antitrust worries of the Competition Commission of India (CCI), which in an Aug. 3 notice warned the companies of further scrutiny, saying their ""humongous market position"" would allow them to enjoy ""un-paralleled bargaining power"" with 92 channels in India's massive media and entertainment market.In particular, the CCI was concerned over how big an impact on competition the merged entity would have in terms of advertising and channel pricing, particularly in the popular Hindi language segment. Legal experts and former CCI officials said such scrutiny was set to delay the deal approval process.Last week, Sony-Zee submitted ""voluntary remedies"" to the deal in writing to assuage the watchdog's concerns, though that did not include structural changes such as the sale of certain channels to reduce the threat of competition, said the two sources, who declined to be named due to confidentiality concerns.Instead, Sony and Zee suggested at least two so-called behavioural remedies, the sources said.Under these, the first source said, Sony and Zee said their merged entity was open to offering mandatory pricing incentives and discounts to all channel distributors, such as direct-to-home satellite operators, on fair and non-discriminatory terms for a certain period after the deal.And to assuage concerns over the entity's strong market position with advertisers, the parties proposed creating and operating ""independent advertising verticals"" for a certain duration, the source added.Spokespersons of Sony and Zee did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Representatives of Sony in Japan did not respond outside regular business hours. The CCI did not respond to a request for comment on the concessions.Three Indian antitrust lawyers familiar with the processes said such remedies by Sony-Zee will be part of ongoing negotiations between the companies and the watchdog. The latter will be free to accept or reject them, or ask for more concessions, they said.""If the CCI is not convinced with the remedies, the matter will go to Phase II -- a detailed investigation stage,"" said Vaibhav Choukse, a competition law partner at India's J. Sagar Associates, who is not involved in the matter.""The CCI has the whip hand and has, on occasions, adopted a 'take it or leave it' approach,"" he added.Sony and Zee in December decided to merge their television channels, film assets and streaming platforms to create a powerhouse in a key growth market of 1.4 billion people, that will challenge rivals like Walt Disney Co.The CCI's initial findings, lawyers and former officials have said, will delay CCI approval of the deal and prolong the process by months at a critical moment for the Indian company.Zee is a household TV name in India set up in 1992 by Subhash Chandra, dubbed the ""Father of Indian Television"". Its founders had to dilute their stake in the Indian company to tackle debt in 2019 and the Sony deal was struck amid a 2021 boardroom conflict with an overseas shareholder.For Sony, the merger will further its ambitions to tap more digital, TV and regional language audiences in the fast-growing Indian market, where international competitors also include the likes of Netflix and Amazon Prime Video.Share article on",https://www.vccircle.com//sonyzee-offer-concessions-to-ease-cci-s-worry-over-merger,Merger/Acquisition,"A unit of Sony Group and India's Zee Entertainment have proposed offering concessions such as pricing discounts to help ease concerns of the country's antitrust regulator over their merger, which will create a $10-billion TV behemoth, two sources told Reuters.The concessions are a bid to iron out antitrust worries of the Competition Commission of India (CCI), which in an Aug. 3 notice warned the companies of further scrutiny, saying their ""humongous market position"" would allow them to enjoy ""un-paralleled bargaining power"" with 92 channels in India's massive media and entertainment market.In particular, the CCI was concerned over how big an impact on competition the merged entity would have in terms of advertising and channel pricing, particularly in the popular Hindi language segment.Legal experts and former CCI officials said such scrutiny was set to delay the deal approval process.Last week, Sony-Zee submitted ""voluntary remedies"" to the deal in writing to assuage the watchdog's concerns, though that did not include structural changes such as the sale of certain channels to reduce the threat of competition, said the two sources, who declined to be named due to confidentiality concerns.Instead, Sony and Zee suggested at least two so-called behavioural remedies, the sources said.Under these, the first source said, Sony and Zee said their merged entity was open to offering mandatory pricing incentives and discounts to all channel distributors, such as direct-to-home satellite operators, on fair and non-discriminatory terms for a certain period after the deal.And to assuage concerns over the entity's strong market position with advertisers, the parties proposed creating and operating ""independent advertising verticals"" for a certain duration, the source added.Spokespersons of Sony and Zee did not immediately respond to a request for comment.","['Sony Group', 'Zee Entertainment', 'Reuters', 'the Competition Commission of India', 'un', 'CCI', 'CCI', 'Sony', 'Sony', 'Sony', 'Sony']",['$10-billion']
Mensa Brands acquires peanut butter brand MyFitness,12 September,"D2C (direct-to-consumer) unicorn Mensa Brands has acquired peanut butter brand MyFitness for an undisclosed sum, the D2C aggregator said on Monday.    The company has now entered the health food category with this deal. This is Mensa’s 22nd reported transaction.    The deal aims to strengthen the brand’s footprint, enabling it to launch new categories, scale D2C, invest in brand-building and expand to global markets. MyFitness' product line-up comprises flavoured peanut butter, crispy peanut butter, and high-protein bars.    Mensa aims to help scale MyFitness in both existing and new markets across channels including D2C, e-commerce platforms, quick commerce platforms and offline channels such as supplement stores, and gyms among other channels.     Founded in 2019 by Mohammad Patel and Rahil Virani, MyFitness raised $1 million in a seed round led by accelerator fund 9Unicorns.    “MyFitness is a fast-growing consumer-loved brand and we will scale the brand to have an omnichannel global presence by leveraging our tech-led playbook. This partnership not only allows us to play in the large and growing healthy food market but does so by leveraging our existing capabilities. We believe we can build MyFitness into a Rs 1,000 crore brand in the next 3-4 years,” Ananth Narayanan, founder and  chief executive officer of Mensa Brands said.  As per a press statement, peanut butter alone is a Rs 600 crore market which is witnessing growth at over 30% CAGR (compound annual growth rate), replacing sugary spreads, and jams.   MyFitness currently has over 30 stock-keeping units (SKUs) with an average selling price of Rs 500. Within 3 years of its inception, the company claims to have sold over 7 million jars of peanut butter. The brand is highly rated across platforms and has a high consumer repeat rate.    The deal value remained undisclosed, in May Narayanan with interaction with VCCircle said Mensa buys only profitable brands which have a revenue beginning from Rs 20 crore to up to Rs 150 crore, the company doesn’t pay revenue multiples but chooses to value deals on EBITDA multiples and prefers cash payment over shares. In a previous interview, Narayan said that the company typically pays around $4 million to $5 million for brands.    Currently, MyFitness has over 30 SKUs (stock-keeping units) with an average selling price of Rs 500. Within 3 years of its inception, the company claims to have sold over 7 million jars of peanut butter.     In June, Mensa acquired Noida-based consumer electronics brand Pebble, marking its debut deal in the smart wearables segment.    Mensa Brands, which was founded in 2021, follows a 'house of brands' strategy, in which it acquires and partners with digital-first brands, with the goal of accelerating growth by providing on-the-ground expertise and tech-led interventions in marketing and operations.   In February this year, Mensa led a Series A round of $75 million funding for homegrown beauty brand Renee Cosmetics. This was a rare investment where Mensa Brands co-invested with other venture capital funds. Usually, the Ananth Narayanan-led entity vies for a majority stake in any startup and has added over dozen to date.

CCI clears PayU's $4.7 bn acquisition of BillDesk in largest fintech deal in India,05 September,"The Competition Commission of India (CCI) has cleared PayU’s acquisition of BillDesk after seeking multiple queries over the last year, paving the way for the largest consolidation in the fintech segment in India. “Commission approves acquisition of 100 per cent of the equity share capital of IndiaIdeas.com (BillDesk) by PayU Payments”, the competition watchdog tweeted on Monday. This brings PayU owner Prosus' total investments in India to $12 billion.“CCI has unconditionally approved the proposed transaction involving the acquisition of IndiaIdeas.com (BillDesk) by PayU India. The proposed transaction involved novel assessment by the CCI of dynamic digital markets,” PayU said in a statement.The deal was first announced last August but was held as CCI sought additional details from PayU.PayU also had to respond to a show cause notice from CCI by end of August 2022 , a person familiar with the deal said. PayU said the combined business will be positioned among the top 10 online payments players globally. This transaction will benefit customers and merchants bringing more resilience and stability to the growing fintech ecosystem in India.  Trilegal represented Prosus and PayU while Shardul Amarchand Managladas & Co acted as legal advisers for BillDesk. ""The CCI issued a show-cause notice with their prima facie competition concerns and sought an explanation as to why a detailed investigation in Phase II should not be undertaken.

NDTV says stake sale to Adani needs nod from tax authorities,01 September,"New Delhi Television Ltd said a major stake sale by its founders to Adani group would require clearance from India's tax authorities, adding another hurdle to the conglomerate's bid to take control of the popular news network.The income tax department in 2017 provisionally barred the founders - Prannoy and Radhika Roy - from selling a part of their stake as part of a reassessment of their taxes, NDTV said in an exchange filing late on Wednesday .NDTV and Adani have locked horns in public after the conglomerate, run by India's richest man, Gautam Adani, last week unveiled plans to control a majority stake in the news network, seen as bastion of independent media.Shares in NDTV rose to the maximum permitted limit of 5% in morning trade on Thursday, marking their sixth straight day of gains after Adani's announcement. The shares are currently trading at their highest level in more than 14 years.Adani has tried to execute the takeover plan by acquiring a little-known Indian company that gave 4 billion rupees ($50 million) in loans to NDTV's founders more than a decade ago in exchange for warrants that allowed it to buy a stake in the news group at any time.Adani Group said last week it had exercised those rights, which NDTV said was done without its consent.NDTV said on Wednesday tax authorities were already reviewing whether the loans gave rise to an estimated capital gains tax obligation of 1.75 billion rupees based on allegations that they amounted to a transfer of the controlling interest in the network.NDTV said it had invited the Adani group's company to join its application to the tax authorities for clarification.

And that Adani group is expected to reach out to the regulator for clarification.In a surprise move on 23 August, the infrastructure giant indirectly acquired a 29.18% stake in the broadcaster by purchasing Vishvapradhan Commercial Pvt Ltd (VCPL), which owned convertible debentures in RRPR. Adani Group also offered to buy 26% more from the open market, as mandated by law.NDTV pushed back against the acquisition, claiming that a prior regulatory nod was needed for the transfer of shares as Sebi barred its founders from dealing in shares for two years till 26 November. However, Adani Group dismissed the contention, countering the owners of NDTV do not need any such approval. VCPL acquired the debentures in FY10 against a ₹404 crore loan extended to the promoter holding company. According to the acquisition notice, NDTV was required to allot the shares to VCPL by 25 August. No transfer of shares has taken place.According to the Mint report, Sebi has formed this opinion by analyzing the loan agreements, its orders, Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT) orders and directions passed by the Supreme Court against NDTV and its promoters in a related case. In addition, Sebi analyzed previous precedents where pledged shares were kept outside the ambit of a Sebi ban in a similar case.Share article on",https://www.vccircle.com//adanindtv-promoters-move-sebi-on-warrant-conversion,Merger/Acquisition,"Promoter of New Delhi Television Ltd (NDTV), RRPR Holding Ltd and Adani group have approached the markets regulator, Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) on Sunday and Monday respectively on warrants that were issued to VCPL.The promoters of NDTV have sought whether a Sebi order, passed in November 2020 which barred promoters Prannoy Roy and Radhika Roy from the securities market for two years, applies on allotting shares that were pledged with VCPL, NDTV said in a stock exchange filing on Monday morning.On Monday evening, the Adani group in an exchange filing said that VCPL now an Adani group entity has also written to Sebi seeking that it provides clarity.“In this regard, we would like to inform you that VCPL has also written a letter dated August 29, 2022 to Sebi, requesting Sebi to help provide clarity, certainty and avoid confusion in the minds of public shareholders of NDTV that has arisen due to the stand taken by RRPR and issue appropriate response to RRPR clarifying that the Sebi order does not restrain RRPR from allotting shares to VCPL,"" said Adani group in an exchange filing.Mint had reported on Monday that the markets regulator has in internal consultations concluded that there is no bar on RRPR, a promoter entity of news broadcaster New Delhi Television Ltd (NDTV), from allotting shares to Adani Group.And that Adani group is expected to reach out to the regulator for clarification.In a surprise move on 23 August, the infrastructure giant indirectly acquired a 29.18% stake in the broadcaster by purchasing Vishvapradhan Commercial Pvt Ltd (VCPL), which owned convertible debentures in RRPR.","['New Delhi Television Ltd', 'NDTV', 'RRPR Holding Ltd', 'Adani', 'Securities and Exchange Board of India', 'NDTV', 'VCPL', 'NDTV', 'Adani', 'VCPL', 'Adani', 'VCPL', 'NDTV', 'RRPR', 'VCPL', 'Adani', 'Mint', 'RRPR', 'New Delhi Television Ltd', 'Adani Group', 'Adani', 'Vishvapradhan Commercial Pvt Ltd', 'RRPR']",[]
"Essar to sell select port, power assets to Arcelor Mittal",29 August,"Essar Group on Friday agreed to sell some of its ports and power and transmission assets to Arcelor Mittal Nippon Steel India (AM/NS) for about $2.4 billion (around ₹19,000 crore). The two entities also agreed to form an equal joint venture to build a 4 mtpa liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminal at Hazira in Gujarat.The closing of the deal, which involves assets in Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh and Odisha, is subject to the completion of corporate and regulatory approvals.After a protracted battle fought in insolvency courts and the Supreme Court, AM/NS acquired Essar Steel’s 10 mtpa integrated steel plant in Hazira for ₹42,000 crore under a bankruptcy auction. The assets in Hazira, which have been sold now, were the subject of a tussle earlier, with AM/NS claiming they were built primarily as captive units for the steel plant and, thus, their ownership should be transferred along with the steel plant. However, these assets were ultimately not included under the insolvency resolution of the Hazira plant.The Essar Steel case was one of the 12 large cases admitted for bankruptcy resolution. AM/NS is a joint venture between ArcelorMittal and Nippon Steel, two of the world’s largest steel companies.A statement from AM/NS said these assets are either captive (including port assets in Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh and Odisha) or allied to AM/NS India’s steelmaking and will strengthen the strategic integration of its manufacturing and logistics chain.“Full ownership of the strategically located port assets in Gujarat, Visakhapatnam and Paradip will ensure seamless connectivity and supply chain security for the movement of raw materials and finished goods between AM/NS India’s manufacturing facilities in western, eastern and southern India, as well as for exports. Acquisition of the power and transmission assets will ensure cost-effective, long-term power supply and energy efficiency at Hazira,” the statement said.The assets being acquired are cash-accruing and will generate operational synergies immediately upon completion of the transaction, it said. AM/NS India will be able to realize further synergies from rising throughput at the port assets as a result of the company’s planned expansion of steel production capacity.“With this deal, which yields a multifold return on our investments, Essar Ports and Terminals has unlocked value for all stakeholders and will continue to focus on building new and modern core infrastructure assets in India and overseas,” Rewant Ruia, director, Essar Ports and Terminals Ltd, said in a separate statement.Prashant Ruia, director of Essar Capital, added, “Essar is now repositioned for growth and resurgence. After consolidating our businesses over the last four years, we have entered the next growth phase focused on helping build a sustainable energy future that will impact lives and livelihoods for a greener world.”Essar added that with this deal, the group would conclude its planned asset monetization programme and complete the debt repayment plan of $25 billion (₹2 trillion) with the Indian banking sector.Essar Group will have aggregate revenues of $15 billion (₹1.2 trillion) and assets under management of $8 billion (₹64,000 crore), comprising assets spread across India and overseas, the statement said. These include a 10 mtpa refinery in the UK, 15 TCF reserves (including some producing fields) of unconventional hydrocarbons in India and Vietnam and a 1,200MW power plant in India. “Essar has planned significant investments in its core sectors of energy, infrastructure, metals & mining and technology & services.

Adani contests NDTV's claims of restriction on selling promoter stake,26 August,"Adani Group on Friday contested claims by New Delhi Television that regulatory curbs restricted its founders from selling their stake, prolonging the battle for control of a news network seen as bastion of independent media.The takeover bid launched by a group led by Asia's richest man, Gautam Adani, has fanned concerns over editorial integrity at NDTV.NDTV on Thursday sought to block Adani's move by saying its founders Prannoy and Radhika Roy have since 2020 been barred by India's market regulator from buying or selling shares in India's securities market, and so can't transfer the shares Adani is trying to secure.But Adani said in a statement on Friday that the NDTV founders' arguments were ""baseless, legally untenable"".It said the founders' investment entity was not part of any regulatory restrictions and was ""bound to immediately perform its obligation and allot the equity shares"" to the conglomerate.""Two sides are clearly at loggerheads now and might have to go to the regulator or courts for relief,"" said Sumit Agrawal, founder of Indian law firm Regstreet Law Advisors and a former official of India's market regulator.Shares in NDTV rose to the maximum permitted limit of 5% in morning trade on Friday, marking their third straight day of gains after Adani showed its hand. The shares are currently trading at their highest level in around 14 years.Adani is trying to execute the takeover through a little-known Indian company Vishvapradhan Commercial Private Ltd.VCPL gave 4 billion rupees ($50 million) in loans to NDTV's founders more than a decade ago in exchange for warrants that allowed it to buy a stake in the news group at any time.The conglomerate said on Aug. 23 it had acquired VCPL and exercised those rights for a 29.18% stake.

Decoding Adani Group's 'stealth' move to buy NDTV stake,24 August,"When India's richest man Gautam Adani unveiled plans for his firm to control a majority stake in New Delhi Television (NDTV) on Tuesday, it was the stealth approach in executing the transaction that drew most attention in the news industry.This is how the firm controlled by the Adani family went about planning the takeover along with NDTV's options, outlined by lawyers.A COMPANY CALLED VCPLAt the heart of Adani Group's two-stage plan to snap up a majority stake in NDTV is a little-known Indian company called Vishvapradhan Commercial Private Limited (VCPL), founded in 2008.More than a decade ago, NDTV founders Radhika and Prannoy Roy took a Rs 4 billion ($50 million) loan from VCPL, and in exchange issued warrants that allowed the company to acquire a 29.18% stake in the news group.Those warrants were convertible at any time. Adani Group said on Tuesday it had acquired VCPL and exercised those rights, which should give it the 29.18% stake.NDTV said it has been given two days to transfer all the shares to the now Adani Group-owned VCPL.Adani Group's takeover bid is without NDTV's consent, the news organisation said in a statement hours after the announcement. Internally, an NDTV memo referred to the move as ""entirely unexpected.""The memo added the company was ""in the process of evaluating next steps, many of which involve regulatory and legal processes,"" without elaborating further.AN OPEN OFFERAdani Group's indirect control over a stake above 25% means it must put forward an open offer to purchase at least 26% more from existing shareholders to give them an opportunity to exit, according to Indian regulations.Laying out its plan, the Adani Group said the open offer will be at Rs 294 per NDTV share for a total consideration of up to $62 million. At the full take-up, this would give it 55.18% of the popular news network.The price was at an unusual 20.5% discount to NDTV's close of 369.75 rupees, though shares had surged in the last month.FOUNDERS NOT IN DIVESTMENT TALKSThe day before Adani Group's plans became public, NDTV said in a stock exchange disclosure that the Roy founders were not in talks with any entity for a change in ownership or a divestment of their stake in NDTV.If the Adani Group deal succeeds, the founding duo will hold around 32% of NDTV, the internal memo stated.WHAT IS NEXT FOR NDTV?Although NDTV has said the move was without its consent, four lawyers who spoke to Reuters on Wednesday said that Adani Group is well within its legal rights in the deal process so far.NDTV, they said, has limited options.The founders could try to stall Adani Group's bid by alleging breach of contract and approach an Indian court for relief, said one Indian law firm partner specialising in M&A transactions.Another lawyer said NDTV should have seen this coming as its founders had issued warrants to VCPL years ago and there was always a possibility a company could execute them to acquire a stake.One option would be for the owners to make their own open offer at a higher price to try to increase their stake.Share article on",https://www.vccircle.com//decodingadani-group-s-stealth-move-to-buy-ndtv-stake,Merger/Acquisition,"When India's richest man Gautam Adani unveiled plans for his firm to control a majority stake in New Delhi Television (NDTV) on Tuesday, it was the stealth approach in executing the transaction that drew most attention in the news industry.This is how the firm controlled by the Adani family went about planning the takeover along with NDTV's options, outlined by lawyers.A COMPANY CALLED VCPLAt the heart of Adani Group's two-stage plan to snap up a majority stake in NDTV is a little-known Indian company called Vishvapradhan Commercial Private Limited (VCPL), founded in 2008.More than a decade ago, NDTV founders Radhika and Prannoy Roy took a Rs 4 billion ($50 million) loan from VCPL, and in exchange issued warrants that allowed the company to acquire a 29.18% stake in the news group.Those warrants were convertible at any time.At the full take-up, this would give it 55.18% of the popular news network.The price was at an unusual 20.5% discount to NDTV's close of 369.75 rupees, though shares had surged in the last month.FOUNDERS NOT IN DIVESTMENT TALKSThe day before Adani Group's plans became public, NDTV said in a stock exchange disclosure that the Roy founders were not in talks with any entity for a change in ownership or a divestment of their stake in NDTV.If the Adani Group deal succeeds, the founding duo will hold around 32% of NDTV, the internal memo stated.WHAT IS NEXT FOR NDTV?Although NDTV has said the move was without its consent, four lawyers who spoke to Reuters on Wednesday said that Adani Group is well within its legal rights in the deal process so far.NDTV, they said, has limited options.The founders could try to stall Adani Group's bid by alleging breach of contract and approach an Indian court for relief, said one Indian law firm partner specialising in M&A transactions.Another lawyer said NDTV should have seen this coming as its founders had issued warrants to VCPL years ago and there was always a possibility a company could execute them to acquire a stake.One option would be for the owners to make their own open offer at a higher price to try to increase their stake.Share article on","['New Delhi Television', 'NDTV', 'NDTV', 'COMPANY', ""Adani Group's"", 'NDTV', 'Vishvapradhan Commercial Private Limited', 'VCPL', 'NDTV', 'VCPL', 'NDTV', ""Adani Group's"", 'NDTV', 'NDTV.If the Adani Group', 'NDTV', 'NDTV', 'Reuters', 'Adani Group', 'NDTV', ""Adani Group's"", 'NDTV']","['$50 million', 'up to $62 million']"

Razorpay to pick up controlling stake in Ezetap,16 August,"Digital payments solutions unicorn, Razorpay has agreed to pick up controlling stake in Bengaluru-based payment solutions provider, Ezetap Mobile Solutions for $126 million (Rs 1,000 crore) in a cash-and-stock deal, two individuals familiar with the deal told VCCircle.Out of the amount mentioned above, $100 million will be a cash transaction, while the remaining would be in equity, one of the individuals said requesting anonymity. Fintech Unicorn Razorpay Eyes Majority Stake In Ezetap Mobile  Razorpay competes with the likes of Paytm, Innoviti Payment Solutions and Pine Labs in the payment solutions space.Earlier in the day, news website Entrackr wrote about the development citing the regulatory filings by target firm's holding company in Singapore. The transaction is likely to close within a few days, the other person added.  Email queries sent to Razorpay and Ezetap went unanswered till press time.  Byas Nambisan, chief executive officer of Ezetap, earlier confirmed that his company is in discussion with several investors, mostly global and local strategic players, besides prominent venture capital funds to raise around Rs 450 crore in funding.   Nambisan took charge of Ezetap in 2019 after co-founders Abhijit Bose and Bhaktha Keshavachar quit to join WhatsApp and float another venture in deep technology space, respectively.   The startup, launched in 2011, had initially started in the fintech space by processing card payments on mobile phones, also known as mobile point-of-sale (mPOS), for large enterprises and businesses. The company was then catering to over 300 big and small enterprises, including the likes of Amazon, Airtel, Reliance, Indian Oil Corporation, ﻿Bigbasket﻿ and Urban Ladder.   However, the company pivoted to a bank partnership model and this turned around the fortunes of the company that has raised $55-60 million in funding till date. Under the model, the startup started approaching banks with full suite of solutions on an Android terminal, including sector-specific payment solutions and value-added features like billing, instant EMIs via debit and credit cards, auto reconciliation and analytics among others.   The startup is currently working with banks such as Axis Bank, HDFC Bank, and ICICI Bank. It has also tied up with government institutions including the municipal corporation of Chennai for tax collection, Guwahati Municipal Corporation to provide citizen services, and Bengaluru Traffic Police (E-challan App), among others.   The company has claimed to have processed $8 billion in annualized gross transaction value (GTV) through 4 lakh retail points as of 2022 and is aiming to reach Rs 7,500 crore in annual revenue by 2024.  Established in 2014, Razorpay Software, the subsidiary of Razorpay Inc., is a full-stack financial services company that provides technology payment solutions to over 8 million businesses.    Founded by alumni of IIT Roorkee, Kumar and Harshil Mathur, Razorpay is the second Indian company to be a part of Silicon Valley’s largest tech accelerator, Y Combinator.    So far, Razorpay has raised $741.5 million in capital so far and was valued at $7.5 billion in December 2021, emerging as the second most highly priced startup in India after Paytm. It is backed by the likes of Lone Pine Capital, Alkeon Capital, TCV, GIC, Tiger Global, Sequoia Capital India, Ribbit Capital, Matrix Partners, Salesforce Ventures, Y Combinator and MasterCard.    Razopay had already struck a few acquisitions offlate. In February this year, it had bought a majority stake in Malaysia-based fintech firm Curlec, marking its first international acquisition.  Razorpay acquired Tera Finlabs, an artificial intelligence (AI)-based risk tech SaaS (software-as-a-service) platform in 2020. The company also acquired Opfin, a payroll and HR management solution in 2019. In 2018, Razorpay marked its first acquisition with Thirdwatch, a fraud analytics AI-platform.Share article on",https://www.vccircle.com//razorpayto-pick-up-controlling-stake-in-ezetap,Merger/Acquisition,"Digital payments solutions unicorn, Razorpay has agreed to pick up controlling stake in Bengaluru-based payment solutions provider, Ezetap Mobile Solutions for $126 million (Rs 1,000 crore) in a cash-and-stock deal, two individuals familiar with the deal told VCCircle.Out of the amount mentioned above, $100 million will be a cash transaction, while the remaining would be in equity, one of the individuals said requesting anonymity.Fintech Unicorn Razorpay Eyes Majority Stake In Ezetap Mobile  Razorpay competes with the likes of Paytm, Innoviti Payment Solutions and Pine Labs in the payment solutions space.Earlier in the day, news website Entrackr wrote about the development citing the regulatory filings by target firm's holding company in Singapore.","['Digital', 'Razorpay', 'Ezetap Mobile Solutions', 'VCCircle', 'Ezetap Mobile', 'Entrackr']","['$126 million', '$100 million', '55', '$8 billion', '$741.5 million', '$7.5 billion']"
Accel-backed Orange Health acquires Gurugram-based diagnostic lab Rapidx,10 August,"Healthtech startup Orange Health has acquired Gurugram-based diagnostic lab Rapidx for an undisclosed sum, the company said on Wednesday.   Orange Health aims to expand its footprint in the NCR region with this deal along with enabling expansion of its flagship service - 60-minutes collection and 6 hour reporting in the northern region. Orange Health will now own a Central Referral lab post this acquisition.    The current acquisition is a part of Orange Health’s strategy to accelerate growth, expand its reach and consolidate its position in the diagnostic sector in India, the company said.     Orange Health is in the process of launching allergy test packages, cancer marker tests, maternal markers for expecting mothers and advanced immunology tests with much faster turnaround times at more affordable rates. Launched by Dr Amit Arora, Kishore Gemini and Dr Dipti Ekka, Rapidx is a NABL (National Accreditation Board for Testing and Calibration Laboratories) and ICMR (Indian Council of Medical Research) approved diagnostic lab. Rapidx’s advanced reference laboratory set up in Flow Cytometry, Immunofluorescence, and ELISA tests will be available in Orange Health’s diagnostics services now.    “We feel that on-demand and at-home service will be the next leap in this sector from the current hyperlocal sample collection centres. This requires building an intelligent and robust supply chain and lab operations that not just promise speed but also on-time delivery. With the current acquisition, we aim to further expand our services and continue our mission to provide the fastest, timely and accurate diagnostic services to people in India,” a joint statement from Orange Health said.     Orange Health was founded in 2020 by Dhruv Gupta and Tarun Bhambra. The healthtech platform claims to be among the fastest-growing diagnostic tech companies in India.     In June, Orange Health secured a Series B funding of $25 million co-led by Bertelsmann India Investments and General Catalyst. The round also saw participation from existing investors like Accel, Y Combinator, Good Capital and Uncorrelated Ventures.    Last year, the platform raised $10 million in Series A funding led by Accel.     The personalized healthcare space has seen significant interest this year with some relatively larger deals.     Fitterfly Healthtech Pvt. Ltd raised $12 million in a Series A funding round led by Amazon Smbhav Venture Fund and Fireside Ventures, marking Amazon Smbhav’s first healthtech bet in India.     In a similar deal, Eka Care raised $15 million in a Series A round led by Hummingbird Ventures. Started by GoIbibo founders Vikalp Sahni and Deepak Tuli in 2020, Eka Care aims to build health profiles for Indians in a bid to achieve better health outcomes and savings in healthcare expenditure. It also has a digital clinic management tool.     Mental health platform Wysa raised $20 million as part of its Series B funding round led by venture capital firm HealthQuad.     In April, Doceree Media India Pvt. Ltd, which runs physician-only platform Doceree, raised Series A funding of $11 million (around Rs 83 crore) led by Eight Roads Ventures, with participation from F-Prime Capital and Alkemi Growth Capital. Share article on",https://www.vccircle.com//accelbacked-orange-health-acquires-gurugram-based-diagnostic-lab-rapidx,Merger/Acquisition,"The current acquisition is a part of Orange Health’s strategy to accelerate growth, expand its reach and consolidate its position in the diagnostic sector in India, the company said.With the current acquisition, we aim to further expand our services and continue our mission to provide the fastest, timely and accurate diagnostic services to people in India,” a joint statement from Orange Health said.","['Orange Health’s', 'Orange Health']","['$25 million', '$10 million', '$12 million', '$15 million', '$20 million', '$11 million']"

upGrad marks 10th acquisition with Exampur,02 August,"Upskilling unicorn upGrad has bought Noida-based online learning platform Exampur for an undisclosed amount in a cash-and-share swap deal, in its tenth acquisition so far.
This follows Mumbai-based upGrad’s 22 July purchase of New Delhi-based online learning platform Harappa Education for $38 million in a cash-and-share swap deal.VCCircle reported in July that International Finance Corporation and IIFL-backed upGrad aims to add 3,000 employees this fiscal besides making major acquisitions over the next 2-3 months.Founded in 2018 by Vivek Kumar and Vardan Gandhi, Exampur is an online learning startup for several competitive examinations. It offers courses for government exam preparation, with a hybrid model comprising offline and online teaching facilities to aspirants from tier-II, III, and IV cities. The startup looks to hit revenue of ₹70 crore this fiscal.Exampur claims to have a user base of over 10 million students and offers over 200 test-prep courses for government jobs.“It’s undeniable that the number of educated candidates in India is growing exponentially, yet they are unemployed. It is also being supported by the pandemic-related disruptions, geopolitical situations, and rising inflation that are negatively hitting the employment elasticity within the country. Hence, we want our learners to walk that extra mile to understand the key to cracking such competitive exams and this is where we have created a hybrid learning model through our digital presence,” said Kumar and Gandhi, co-founders of Exampur, in a joint statement.UpGrad Education Pvt. Ltd, which runs the upGrad platform, was founded in 2015 by Ronnie Screwvala, Mayank Kumar and Phalgun Kompalli. This year, the company has made five acquisitions so far, including Exampur, taking the total tally to ten deals till date.“When we look at non-linear growth, we make sure it complements our commitment of driving maximum career outcomes for our learners. Hence, with Exampur, we are foraying into the government test prep market for the first time which is a completely new space for us,” Kumar, co-founder of upGrad said in an interview.“The audience is different from our working professionals and lifelong learning segments who are aspiring to build a career through government jobs like UPSC, SSC, defence, banking and teaching including other state-level government jobs.

GM calls off plan to sell India car plant to China's Great Wall,01 July,"General Motors (GM) said on Friday it had called off the sale of a shuttered Indian plant to China's Great Wall Motor after they failed to obtain regulatory approvals, amid a tougher stance by New Delhi towards investments from Beijing.GM struck a deal in January 2020 to sell the plant to Great Wall, with the Chinese SUV-maker expected to pay up to $300 million as part of a broader plan to invest $1 billion to establish a presence in India's growing car market.The agreement, which was extended twice, expired on June 30. ""We have been unable to obtain the required approvals within the time frame of the deal,"" George Svigos, executive director of communications at GM International, told Reuters. ""Our strategy in India remains unchanged and we will now explore further options for the sale of the site,"" he said, adding the company ""hopes to achieve a price that reflects the value of the asset"".""Great Wall Motor will keep its attention to the Indian market in the future and continue looking for new opportunities,"" the Chinese automaker said in a statement on Friday, while confirming the termination of the plant deal. The Indian government did not immediately respond to emails seeking comment.GM's deal with Great Wall was agreed just months before India toughened its stance in April 2020 on investment from neighbouring countries including China, making them the first major casualty of the move that has held up billions of dollars of capital inflow in sectors such as automobiles and technology.This was part of a broader crackdown by India on businesses with Chinese links amid worsening diplomatic relations. Separately, New Delhi also banned more than 300 Chinese mobile apps, including TikTok, over security concerns.The move draws a line under a more than two-year effort by GM and Great Wall, forcing the U.S. firm to restart its hunt for a buyer while it continues to spend money on maintaining some machinery and tooling in the factory.Asked if the plant could be used to make electric vehicles, Svigos said it was suitable for a number of industrial uses, including by non-automotive companies, and GM would explore all options.GM, which stopped selling cars in India at the end of 2017, has already sold its other plant to SAIC Motor Corp, where the Chinese automaker builds cars under its British brand, MG Motor.This will also send Great Wall back to the drawing board on its plans to enter India, which it considered an important part of its global strategy to break into new markets like Latin America, Thailand and Brazil. Last year, Great Wall re-allocated to Brazil a portion of its $1-billion investment earmarked for India and reassigned some of its staff after delays in winning government approvals.(Reporting by Aditi Shah, Zhang YanEditing by Mark Potter and Kmi Coghill)Share article on",https://www.vccircle.com//gm-calls-off-plan-to-sell-india-car-plant-to-china-s-great-wall,Merger/Acquisition,"General Motors (GM) said on Friday it had called off the sale of a shuttered Indian plant to China's Great Wall Motor after they failed to obtain regulatory approvals, amid a tougher stance by New Delhi towards investments from Beijing.GM struck a deal in January 2020 to sell the plant to Great Wall, with the Chinese SUV-maker expected to pay up to $300 million as part of a broader plan to invest $1 billion to establish a presence in India's growing car market.The agreement, which was extended twice, expired on June 30.Separately, New Delhi also banned more than 300 Chinese mobile apps, including TikTok, over security concerns.The move draws a line under a more than two-year effort by GM and Great Wall, forcing the U.S. firm to restart its hunt for a buyer while it continues to spend money on maintaining some machinery and tooling in the factory.Asked if the plant could be used to make electric vehicles, Svigos said it was suitable for a number of industrial uses, including by non-automotive companies, and GM would explore all options.GM, which stopped selling cars in India at the end of 2017, has already sold its other plant to SAIC Motor Corp, where the Chinese automaker builds cars under its British brand, MG Motor.This will also send Great Wall back to the drawing board on its plans to enter India, which it considered an important part of its global strategy to break into new markets like Latin America, Thailand and Brazil.","['General Motors', 'GM', 'Great Wall Motor', 'GM', 'TikTok', 'GM', 'GM', 'GM', 'SAIC Motor Corp', 'MG Motor']","['up to $300 million', '$1 billion', 'billions of dollars', '$1-billion']"

Zomato to acquire Blinkit for $569 mn,24 June,"Online food aggregator and delivery platform Zomato on Friday said its board has agreed to acquire quick commerce startup Blinkit for Rs 4,447 crore (for $569 million) in an all-stock deal.Zomato will issue up to 62.9 crore shares to Blinkit investors, amounting to equity dilution of 6.88% stake, on a fully diluted basis at the prescribed preferential allotment price of Rs 70.76 per share, Zomato said. Zomato's shares on Friday closed at Rs 70.35 a piece on the BSE.In addition, Zomato is also acquiring Blinkit's warehousing and ancillary services business HOTPL for $8 million. It is, however, not acquiring the B2B trading business as that no longer fits strategically into its plans, it added. This deal knocks Blinkit off the unicorn perch. Last July, Zomato acquired around 9.3% stake in the business then known as Grofers, which pushed the startup's valuation to over $1 billion. SoftBank, which had the largest shareholding in Blinkit with a 46% stake, will get around 3.2% as part of the transaction, as per VCCircle estimates. Tiger Global will get approximately 1.3% stake and Sequoia Capital, already an investor in Zomato, will get approximately 0.5% stake.Other investors in Blinkit who stand to get new shares in Zomato include Korea's KTB Ventures, Yuri Milner's Apollete Asia and Bennet Coleman and Company Ltd.Grofers International Pte, which is the promoter entity of Grofers founders, gets around 7.59 crore shares or over 0.8 pc stake in ZomatoThe new Zomato shares issued are subject to lock-ins. ""While the statutory lock-in requirement is six months, we have negotiated for a 12 month lock-in for selling shareholders of Blinkit,"" it added.In addition, 50% of the shares attributable to the founder of Blinkit will be locked-in for 24 months and the balance 50% will be locked-in for 12 months.

This business is also synergistic with our core food business, giving Zomato the right to win in the long-term,"" he added.Albinder Dhindsa, founder of Blinkit, will continue to lead the quick commerce business.The acquisition is expected to be completed by August this year.The acquisition brings relief to Blinkit as competition in the quick commerce space has heated up. Blinkit also reportedly laid off employees, shuttered dark stores, and delayed some vendor in the payments earlier this year.Zomato  said that losses of Blinkit have come down sharply between January and May owing to operating leverage and improved execution. Blinkit also shut down a number of its unviable store which were not scaling and that also helped bring down losses, it noted.The dark store count has come down to about 400 in May 2022, as compared to more than 450 in January 2022. ""The team will continue to evaluate non-performing stores and learn what does not work,"" it said.Blinkit is expected to becomes adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) break-even in less than three years.Blinkit's revenue per order jumped due to an increase in commissions and customer delivery charges, it added. According to the Zomato's disclosure, Blinkit clocked a turnover of Rs 236.32 crore in fiscal ended March 31, 2022 as compared to Rs 200 crore in FY21 and Rs 165 crore in FY20.The blog also said that in its shareholders' letter dated Februray 2022, Zomato had shared an upper bound of $400 million, or Rs 3000 crore investment in quick commerce in calendar years 2022 and 2022.

Since then it has extended Rs 1125 crore as debt to Blinkit and has additional Rs 1875 crore as plan for further potential investment in quick commmerce going forward. ""Most of this capital will go towards funding losses in Blinkit during the remainder of CY22 and CY23,"" it said.Notably, Blinkit had turned unicorn in August last year after getting over $120 million from Zomato and existing investor Tiger Global Management. A unicorn is a privately held startup with a valuation of more than $1 billion. Zomato's investment in Blinkit last year also meant Zomato would be bringing groceries back on to the platform, after discontinuing it in 2020.The acquisition of Blinkit highlights the hypercompetitive and cash guzzling nature of the quick commerce space. Blinkit was one of the record 44 unicorns created in India last year. A unicorn is a privately held startup valued at more than $1 billion.After achieving the unicorn status last year, Blinkit's co-founder and chief executive Albinder Dhindsa told Mint that it is undergoing a massive transition as it sought to bet big on making all deliveries under 10 minutes. Soon, it rebranded itself to Blinkit to focus on its pivot to quick commerce in December.Meanwhile, new and older startups also joined the quick commerce bandwagon as 10-minute delivery service became the buzzword. For instance, Zepto, a 10-minute grocery delivery app founded by 18-year-old dropouts of computer science degree course at Stanford University last year, raised $100 million (around Rs 758 crore) in a Series C funding round led by American technology startup accelerator Y Combinator’s Continuity Fund in December. This funding round came 45 days after the company announced its $60 million fundraise in November. Earlier this year, Ola also rebranded its quick commerce business as Ola Dash.Share article on",https://www.vccircle.com//zomato-to-acquire-blinkit-for-569-mn,Merger/Acquisition,"This business is also synergistic with our core food business, giving Zomato the right to win in the long-term,"" he added.Albinder Dhindsa, founder of Blinkit, will continue to lead the quick commerce business.The acquisition is expected to be completed by August this year.The acquisition brings relief to Blinkit as competition in the quick commerce space has heated up.According to the Zomato's disclosure, Blinkit clocked a turnover of Rs 236.32 crore in fiscal ended March 31, 2022 as compared to Rs 200 crore in FY21 and Rs 165 crore in FY20.The blog also said that in its shareholders' letter dated Februray 2022, Zomato had shared an upper bound of $400 million, or Rs 3000 crore investment in quick commerce in calendar years 2022 and 2022.","['Blinkit', 'Blinkit', 'Blinkit', 'Februray 2022']","['$569 million', '$8 million', 'over $1 billion', '$400 million', '$120 million', 'more than $1 billion', 'more than $1 billion', '$100 million', '$60 million']"

Zilingo cofounders make an offer to stave off liquidation,19 June,"Zilingo cofounders Dhruv Kapoor and Ankiti Bose have come together to take back control of the fashion ecommerce business, in a bid to avoid liquidation, according to two persons with knowledge of the deal.  On Sunday, Kapoor tabled a  'preliminary and non-binding offer'  proposing to pay off the $48 million outstanding debt owed to Varde Partners and Indies Capital, and infuse $8 million in fresh equity into the company, with the help of an investor group backing this deal.

Shiprocket to acquire Pickrr for around $200 mn,15 June,"Marking a major consolidation in the e-commerce enablement industry, Shiprocket has agreed to acquire Pickrr for around $200 million in a mix of cash and stock deal, a top executive told VCCircle. “What we would have built in a longer period of time, we can now do it quickly with this acquisition. The founders of Pickrr will stay. We have barely scratched the surface and they will continue building along with us,” Saahil Goel, co-founder and chief executive officer of Shiprocket, said in an interaction. “One of the main advantages of acquiring Pickrr is that their combined data pool will lead to warehouse optimization, consumer intelligence and conversion optimization. This acquisition will also help shipping partners to align strategically and engage more closely with the combined entity to create more value in last mile logistics for the 75,000-merchant base,” Goel added. Gaurav Mangla, co-founder of Pickrr, said that the company had two more offers apart from Shiprocket’s, one of which was from a private equity fund.  “Taking the PE offer would have meant that the rat race with Shiprocket to chase the same set of customers would have continued, leading to more cash burn and depleting gross margins,” he noted.  Pickrr’s investors, which held around 50% stake in the company, according to a person close to the development, have made handsome returns.  Angel investors of the logistics startup have made more than 100 times and its Series A investors have made more than 20 times. Pickrr’s Series B investors walked home with 4-5 times returns in less than a year, he added.  Founded in 2015 by Mangla, Rhitiman Majumder and Ankit Kaushik, Pickrr raised $12 million in a Series B funding round led by IIFL, Amicus Capital and Ananta Capital in August last year. Existing investors Omidyar Network India and Guild Capital also participated in that round. For Shiprocket, Pickrr is its fourth acquisition this year. The third-party logistics or 3PL player earlier acquired Glaucus, Rocketbox and Wigzo. Shiprocket’s Goel said that the company will continue to look at inorganic growth opportunities in the post-purchase category that includes customer services, shipping, packaging, returns and refunds. He added that the company has enough cash reserves without specifying a number and that most of them are reserved for acquisitions. Goel also sought to dismiss the perception that it is looking to take on the big players of the logistics space such as Delhivery and Xpressbees who are also its partners. “We are an operating system which means that we build all of this technology which anyone can plug into. Our vision is to partner with people and build this operating system. We ourselves will not get into ground logistics. That is not on the table. When we are working with our 3PL (third party logistics) partners, there is no feeling of competition. Fundamentally, we are two different companies. Just like there is a big difference between being a bank and a payment gateway,” Goel added. Shiprocket, according to its founders, will not engage in any fund-raising at the moment.  “We have been opportunistic about our fund-raising. If the business requires capital, then we will do it,” Goel said.  In December last year, Shiprocket signed definitive agreements to raise $185 million (Rs 1380 crore) as part of its Series E funding round co-led led by Zomato Ltd, Temasek Holdings and Lightrock India. Goel did not disclose the latest financials of the company but said that Shiprocket’s core business is profitable. The company clocked a revenue of Rs 364 crore in fiscal 2020-21 from Rs 161 crore in the previous financial year, according to VCCEdge, the data and intelligence platform of VCCircle. It posted a net profit of Rs 12.4 crore during the period as compared to Rs 10 crore during the same period the previous fiscal.  A person close to the development said that the company ended fiscal 2021-22 at a revenue of Rs 625 crore. Shiprocket had also entered the international market last year with its entry into Saudi Arabia.  “We have launched the first version, just the tech layer for now in Saudi Arabia. It is a small unit but it has got good legs,” said Goel. The company does not plan to enter new regions in the international market this year as it wants to focus on the domestic market.“We will definitely be a global company in 10 years though,” he added. Notably, the company recently launched cross border offerings to allow people to move goods outside India. Share article on",https://www.vccircle.com//shiprocket-to-acquire-pickrr-for-around-200-mn,Merger/Acquisition,"The company clocked a revenue of Rs 364 crore in fiscal 2020-21 from Rs 161 crore in the previous financial year, according to VCCEdge, the data and intelligence platform of VCCircle.The company does not plan to enter new regions in the international market this year as it wants to focus on the domestic market.“We will definitely be a global company in 10 years though,” he added.",['VCCircle'],"['around $200 million', '$12 million', '$185 million']"

Pristyn Care buys doctor consultation platform Lybrate,07 June,"Pristyn Care, a chain of multi-specialty clinics for planned surgeries, on Tuesday said it has acquired one of the first venture capital backed healthtech platforms in the country Lybrate.""Lybrate makes a compelling strategic fit to give access to primary care to our patients via online consultation services,"" said Harsimarbir Singh, co-founder at Pristyn Care, in a statement without disclosing the financial details of the transaction.He added that similar acquisitions will help consolidate, scale and grow healthcare delivery assets.Last year in November, VCCircle had reported that Pristyn Care was in talks to acquire one of the most heavily venture capital (VC) -funded and popular healthcare platforms, Practo Technologies Pvt. Ltd. As part of the transaction, Lybrate’s 150 employees will join Pristyn Care, the statement added. Pristyn Care, operated by GHV Advanced Care Pvt. Ltd, was founded in 2018 by Singh, Vaibhav Kapoor and Garima Sawhney. The company raised its first external funding the following year from Sequoia Capital. Last year in December, Pristyn Care raised $96 million (Rs 726 crore) as part of its Series E funding round led by a clutch of investors, including Sequoia Capital and Tiger Global. The funding round was raised at a valuation of $1.4 billion, turning the healthtech startup into a unicorn.A unicorn is a privately held startup valued at over $1 billion.Lybrate, founded in 2013 by Saurabh Arora and Rahul Narang in 2013, was one of the first healthtech startups to attract venture capital funding. It had roped in Nexus Venture Partners as its first external investor in 2014, according to VCCEdge, the data and intelligence platform of VCCircle.  The following year, it raised $10.2 million in a Series A funding round from Tiger Global Management and Ratan Tata, chairman emeritus of Tata Sons. In 2017, it raised another small funding of $3 million, as per VCCEdge.A majority of the venture capital money in the healthtech segment has gone into e-pharmacy firms like IPO-bound PharmEasy and doctor consultations startups like Practo. Another online health platform MediBuddy snagged $125 million in a Series C funding co-led by Quadria Capital and Lightrock India earlier in February this year.Notably, recent layoff woes in the startup ecosystem have not escaped the healthtech space.Last month, digital health platform Mfine laid off over 50% of its staff. This came after Mfine raised $48 million in Series C funding from new and existing investors last year.India has more than 5,000 healthtech startups and the industry is currently pegged at $1.9 billion, according to a report last year by transaction advisory firm RBSA Advisors that cited research done by the Internet and Mobile Association of India (IAMAI) and Praxis Global Alliance. This number, however, accounts for a mere 1% of the overall healthcare industry in the country.The healthtech segment is expected to grow at a CAGR (compounded annual growth rate) of 39% to touch $5 billion by 2023 and RBSA added the segment has the potential to grow to $50 billion over the next 10-12 years. Share article on",https://www.vccircle.com//pristyn-care-buys-doctor-consultation-platform-lybrate,Merger/Acquisition,"""Lybrate makes a compelling strategic fit to give access to primary care to our patients via online consultation services,"" said Harsimarbir Singh, co-founder at Pristyn Care, in a statement without disclosing the financial details of the transaction.He added that similar acquisitions will help consolidate, scale and grow healthcare delivery assets.Last year in November, VCCircle had reported that Pristyn Care was in talks to acquire one of the most heavily venture capital (VC) -funded and popular healthcare platforms, Practo Technologies Pvt.This number, however, accounts for a mere 1% of the overall healthcare industry in the country.The healthtech segment is expected to grow at a CAGR (compounded annual growth rate) of 39% to touch $5 billion by 2023 and RBSA added the segment has the potential to grow to $50 billion over the next 10-12 years.","['Lybrate', 'VCCircle', 'RBSA']","['$96 million', '$1.4 billion', 'over $1 billion', '$10.2 million', '$3 million', '$125 million', '$48 million', '$1.9 billion', '$5 billion', '$50 billion']"

ACME earmarks nearly $7 bn for renewable energy investments in Karnataka,06 June,"Renewable energy firm ACME Group will invest ₹52,000 crore ($6.70 billion) in Karnataka over five years to set up a green hydrogen and ammonia plant, the state government said on Monday. The investment comes as India aims to manufacture five million tonnes of green hydrogen annually by 2030 to meet its climate targets and become a production and export centre for the fuel. The green hydrogen and ammonia plant, which will create about 2,000 jobs, will have the capacity to produce 1.2 million tonnes per annum. It will also have a solar power unit attached. Green hydrogen, produced using renewable energy, has some of the best environmental credentials among cleaner-burning fuels. The zero-carbon fuel is made using renewable power from wind or solar sources to split water into hydrogen and oxygen. While green hydrogen is not currently made in India on a commercial scale, Indian businessmen Mukesh Ambani and Gautam Adani have announced plans to produce it. Earlier in May, Karnataka signed a $6.4 billion agreement with U.S.-listed ReNew Power over a 7-year period on energy projects in the state. India, with a population more than three times larger than the European Union, has a much lower per capita energy consumption, but among the fastest rates of energy demand growth in the world. Share article on",https://www.vccircle.com//acme-earmarks-nearly-7-bn-for-renewable-energy-investments-in-karnataka,Merger/Acquisition,"The investment comes as India aims to manufacture five million tonnes of green hydrogen annually by 2030 to meet its climate targets and become a production and export centre for the fuel.India, with a population more than three times larger than the European Union, has a much lower per capita energy consumption, but among the fastest rates of energy demand growth in the world.",['the European Union'],"['52,000', '$6.70 billion', '$6.4 billion']"
Gupshup buys Sequoia-backed OneDirect in 4th acquisition this year,02 June,"Gupshup on Thursday said it has acquired omnichannel customer service platform OneDirect in the conversational messaging platform's fourth acquisition this year alone and its fifth since September 2021. The acquisition strengthens Gupshup’s suite of conversational solutions and enables superior omnichannel conversational engagement with a powerful and flexible live Agent Assist solution, said Gupshup in a statement without disclosing the financial details. In an interaction with VCCircle, Beerud Sheth, Co-Founder and CEO, Gupshup, said that the transaction was a mix of cash and stock deal and the entire team of OneDirect like in its previous acquisitions will continue to lead the company. OneDirect was started in 2013 under Coraza Technologies Pvt. Ltd, which also operated personal assistant platform Tapzo.  Tapzo in 2018 announced that it had shut its app after reportedly being in the news that Amazon will acquire it.  The acquisition of Tapzo by Amazon was not made public even as media reports pegged the deal at $30-40 million.  Tapzo, which had its origins in 2010, initially started off as Akosha.com, an online customer feedback platform.  In 2015, it rebranded itself as Helpchat, a chat-based personal assistant. Subsequently, in November 2016, it underwent one more pivot and became Tapzo while picking up venture funding from the likes of Sequoia Capital and American Express over the years.  OneDirect meanwhile continued to work as a sperate entity. OneDirect, which also counted Sequoia Capital and American Express among its investors, enables businesses to manage all customer conversations across multiple channels such as SMS, WhatsApp, voice and email using a simple and unified agent dashboard interface. It claims to have processed over 1 billion customer interactions across 10 different languages for brands like Canara Bank, Tata Capital, Paytm, and Pizzahut. “We are excited to join the Gupshup family and look forward to building more efficient and personalized conversational experiences,"" said Vishrut Chalsani, Co-Founder and CEO, OneDirect. ""Gupshup’s advanced AI capabilities combined with Onedirect's robust customer service and engagement platform will provide businesses the ability to reinvent customer experience,"" added Chalsani. Gupshup's Sheth said that the acquisition of OneDirect was ""probably the last of the original set of target companies it was evaluating"" since last year.  ""There is no specific acquisiton at the moment but there is an active pipeline and we continue to evaluate,"" he added. He also said that with OneDirect's acquisition its product capability looks complete and it is ""less likely"" to buy anything to strengthen its product side.  ""Next perhaps we might look at a company that will help us in geographical expansion. But the space and customer demands keep evolving so we'll continue to keep a watch on everything,"" he added. For geographical expansion, Gupshup's focus is on all the emerging markets. ""We are seeing a huge need for conversational engagement in Latin America, the Middle East, Africa and Southeast Asia, and we have physical team in all of these geographies. Beyond these regions we will keep evaluating for partners,"" he explained. Gupshup's three acquisitions earlier this year were -- virtual shopping assistant platform, AskSkid (April), conversational AI platform for fintech and banks, Active.Ai (April), and cloud telephony company, Knowlarity Communications (February). Gupshup is also on track to raise its pre-IPO funding round despite the tight liquidity environment. ""We are on the verge of putting it together. It is very difficult funding market. In our case we have growth and profitablity so we are in a middle of an update and we will have an announcement soon,"" he said. In April, Sheth had told VCCircle that it is in talks with potential investors for a pre-IPO funding of $100-200 million or even larger. ""(On the general funding environment) the challenge is that a lot of investors have lost money in the public markets and it may take a little longer for them to get to a yes. That is the reason why the fundraise becomes harder and that has nothing to do with the companies. But some other investors are not as leveraged and some of them may have benefited from this market -- oil prices are up so the Middle East money has increased a lot. As an entrepreneur I don't worry about it and focus on building my business,"" he explained. Sheth also said that as earlier planned the company is ready and targeting its initial public offering (IPO) at the end of the year or early next year depending on market conditions. In April 2021, Gupshup raised a primary funding of $100 million from Tiger Global which marked its entry into the unicorn club. Few months later, it secured an additional $240 million in its Series F round of funding, paving the way for an exit of its early investors. A unicorn is a startup with a valuation of over $1 billion. Founded in 2004 by Beerud Sheth and Rakesh Mathur, Gupshup pivoted from being an offline search engine to a business-to-business (B2B) customer engagement platform across SMS and other channels. Share article on",https://www.vccircle.com//gupshup-buys-sequoia-backed-onedirect-in-4th-acquisition-this-year,Merger/Acquisition,"In an interaction with VCCircle, Beerud Sheth, Co-Founder and CEO, Gupshup, said that the transaction was a mix of cash and stock deal and the entire team of OneDirect like in its previous acquisitions will continue to lead the company.""(On the general funding environment) the challenge is that a lot of investors have lost money in the public markets and it may take a little longer for them to get to a yes.","['VCCircle', 'Co-Founder', 'OneDirect']","['30', '100', '$100 million', 'an additional $240 million', 'over $1 billion']"
Arya.ag acquires agri data science firm Prakshep,02 June,"Arya.ag, an integrated grain commerce platform, on Thursday, said it has acquired agriculture-focused data science company, Prakshep for an undisclosed sum.    The acquisition aims to bolster artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) capabilities for farm digitization, crop monitoring, quality assaying and surveillance. The acquisition will help Arya in deepening its relationship with other agri-chain stakeholders like processors, banks and insurance companies.The company stated that digital offerings of Prakshep will add to its deep tech capability to provide traceability, transparency and quality assurance. Post acquisition, Arya.ag will hold the largest database in agriculture adding farm details including boundaries, crop activities, health and yield valuation to its existing repository of storage and grain value chain database.“Leveraging our technology stack, we have already created a digital identity for over 10,000 warehouses across India on Arya.ag and have built in transparency at all levels from aggregation to storage, finance and commerce. Under this context, Prakshep’s tech-led proposition is a natural fit as it enables a digital identity for every grain that traverses the value chain and builds in transparency. The aligned values of sustainability, climate-smart agriculture and inclusive economic growth have brought us together,” Prasanna Rao, co-founder of Arya.ag said.Arya.ag said Prakshep’s acquisition also aligns Arya’s focus on climate-smart agricultural models with a reduced carbon footprint. Prakshep’s models have facilitated a 45% reduction in crop damage, 40% reduction in the use of chemicals, 35% reduction in water usage and a 30% fall in GHG (greenhouse gas emissions) emissions. Climate-smart agriculture is pertinent to the challenges of food security and climate change.Arya.ag was originally part of the JM Baxi Group. In 2013, co-founders Prasanna Rao, Chattanathan Devarajan and Anand Chandra acquired a controlling stake in the company. Before taking a controlling stake in Arya, Rao was the head of farm commodity finance at ICICI Bank while Anand was previously ICICI’s national product head for agricultural commodity finance.The company is backed by Quona Capital, LGT Lightstone Aspada and Omnivore. In December 2020, it had raised $21 million as a part of its Series B funding round. In March 2020, Arya.ag had raised $6 million in a pre-Series B funding round.

As Travel Resumes Japanese interest in India gains pace,24 May,"Like much of the world, as the pandemic-induced lockdowns prohibited travel, mergers and acquisitions (M&As) in the Japan-India corridor also stalled. Following the pause, on the back of changing geo-political developments and continuing growth in India, cross-border M&A between the two countries is expected to rebound. The contraction during covid notwithstanding, the World Bank predicts economic growth in India to be in excess of 7% in the coming year. We are also seeing continued bonhomie between the governments, as Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida recently announced a $42- billion investment into India over the next five years. Moreover, there is ample capital available and ready to be deployed by Japanese investors as the deal pipelines expand.Paths for Japanese InvestorsThe objectives for Japanese investors remain the same: large Indian marketplace and a stable, strategic sourcing base, the latter being further strengthened in view of the shift away from China-dependence. These objectives could be met by one of the following: greenfield investments, minority stake M&As and majority stake M&As.Greenfield investment remains time-consuming and has serious execution challenges so it may be followed only by Japanese companies with a long history and experience of operating in India, while minority M&A deals come with the baggage of complications for being dependent on an Indian partner.As things open up, we expect to see more Japanese interest in controlling or majority stake transactions, wherein the companies can be smoothly integrated into the buyers’ global supply chains.Recent M&A, though few, has shown an increasing appetite of Japanese investors to make large bets on India, case in point being the recent acquisition of Escorts by their erstwhile partner, Kubota of Japan. We expect to continue seeing more majority stake M&A transactions for Japanese investors looking to deploy capital in India.Sectoral focusThough there are a number of sectors which are witnessing Japanese interest, it is especially true for the industrials and chemicals, clean energy, technology-IT services, NBFCs (non-banking financial companies) and infrastructure sectors. These are segments where Japanese companies have strong technology back-ends and experience.
Moreover, these sectors also require large sums of capital to be deployed over longer tenures. We still do not see enough Japanese activity (Softbank aside) in the newer-age, high-growth, consumer-centric technology businesses, where western capital and more aggressive fund managers and investment committees have been able to outbid and outmaneuver traditional investors. Accordingly, we will continue to see Japanese companies as strong and credible buyers for traditional businesses which need long-term, and not-so-expensive and risky capital.Maneuvering deals in IndiaDespite a shared larger alignment on the macro environment and long history of Japanese investment in India, Japanese buyers would have to continue building flexibility as they approach M&A in India, which is still dominated by family-owned businesses, while Japanese companies tend to be driven by an organizational structure.This can make execution of a deal in a timely manner challenging, especially for prime sectors like IT and energy, where competition with global private equity firms is becoming fiercer. We continue to advocate an ‘early start’ to prospective Japanese buyers, build relationships with Indian families who may potentially be sellers, and try and create a transaction rather than just respond to ‘Western-style’ auction processes.We see a lot of ‘fence-sitters’ among the second generation of family-owned businesses, and a sensible push from a serious Japanese buyer is usually the catalyst to a bilateral transaction—a situation much more suited to buyers from the East.Japanese strategists looking for opportunities to participate in the Indian marketplace and build alternatives to their supply chains, as well as Indian business owners developing an exit strategy, should consider these key insights to spur M&A in this very important business corridor.Preet Singh is managing director, mergers and acquisitions-industrials, Mumbai, Lincoln International.Share article on",https://www.vccircle.com//as-travel-resumes-japanese-interest-in-india-gains-pace,Merger/Acquisition,"These objectives could be met by one of the following: greenfield investments, minority stake M&As and majority stake M&As.Greenfield investment remains time-consuming and has serious execution challenges so it may be followed only by Japanese companies with a long history and experience of operating in India, while minority M&A deals come with the baggage of complications for being dependent on an Indian partner.As things open up, we expect to see more Japanese interest in controlling or majority stake transactions, wherein the companies can be smoothly integrated into the buyers’ global supply chains.Recent M&A, though few, has shown an increasing appetite of Japanese investors to make large bets on India, case in point being the recent acquisition of Escorts by their erstwhile partner, Kubota of Japan.We continue to advocate an ‘early start’ to prospective Japanese buyers, build relationships with Indian families who may potentially be sellers, and try and create a transaction rather than just respond to ‘Western-style’ auction processes.We see a lot of ‘fence-sitters’ among the second generation of family-owned businesses, and a sensible push from a serious Japanese buyer is usually the catalyst to a bilateral transaction—a situation much more suited to buyers from the East.Japanese strategists looking for opportunities to participate in the Indian marketplace and build alternatives to their supply chains, as well as Indian business owners developing an exit strategy, should consider these key insights to spur M&A in this very important business corridor.Preet Singh is managing director, mergers and acquisitions-industrials, Mumbai, Lincoln International.Share article on","['Kubota', 'Lincoln International']",['$42- billion']

Analysis: Why Twitter has ignored Elon Musk's 'trolling',17 May,"A unilateral pronouncement that the acquisition of Twitter Inc is ""on hold"". Fierce criticism of the social media company's handling of spam accounts. A ""poop emoji"" directed at Twitter's chief executive, Parag Agrawal. These are just some of Elon Musk's tweets in the last four days, culminating in a suggestion by the Tesla Inc chief executive at a conference in Miami on Monday that his $44 billion deal could be renegotiated at a lower price.Twitter believes Musk's comments have been in breach of the non-disparagement terms of his agreement to buy Twitter, according to people familiar with the matter.Yet the San Francisco-based company has not taken any legal action against Musk over what it sees as his ""trolling"" of the deal, and plans to do so only if he does not carry out the tasks needed to complete the transaction, the sources said.One of the sources involved in the deal added that Twitter was trying to ""block out the noise"".Musk's representatives have continued to collaborate with Twitter, according to the sources. They have been preparing information for submission to regulators, and - if they continue to cooperate - Twitter plans to file its proxy statement, which will outline for its shareholders how the deal came together, as early as this week, the sources added.At the same time, some Twitter executives and advisers are concerned that Musk may be laying the groundwork for renegotiating the agreement and are preparing to defend the deal in court, according to the sources. They pointed to Musk's comments about the deal becoming increasingly negative. ""The more questions I ask (about the issue of spam accounts) the more my concerns grow,"" Musk said at the Miami conference on Monday.The sources requested not to be identified because they were discussing confidential deal planning. Representatives for Twitter and Musk did not respond to requests for comment.Some of Twitter's leaders have not been indifferent to Musk's comments. Agrawal took to Twitter on Monday to defend the company's methodology for accounting for spam accounts, while Twitter chairman Bret Taylor tweeted on Friday that ""we remain committed to our agreement"".Twitter shares ended trading on Monday at $37.39, 5% lower than where they traded before Musk revealed on April 4 he had amassed a stake in the company, and 31% lower than the $54.20 per share deal price. This indicates that investors deem it highly likely that Musk will walk away or renegotiate the deal at a lower price.Twitter is continuing to provide Musk with information on spam accounts, the sources said. Musk is entitled to this data as part of his planning to own Twitter under the terms of his agreement with the company.Musk has questioned the accuracy of Twitter's public disclosures in which the company has said that these accounts make up ""well under 5%"" of its user base. Twitter has cautioned that this is an estimate.Independent researchers have projected that 9% to 15% of the millions of Twitter profiles are bots. Musk said on Monday that he suspects they make up at least 20% of Twitter's users.One concern weighing on Twitter as it shares information with Musk is that he may violate his non-disclosure agreement with the company and share confidential information about its platform and users, one of the sources said. Musk has argued that Twitter needs to make more information public about how its platform operates. WAIVED DUE DILIGENCEMusk, the world's richest person, waived due diligence when he agreed to buy Twitter on April 25, in an effort to get the San Francisco-based company to accept his ""best and final offer."" Since then, technology stocks have plunged amid investor concerns over inflation and an economic slowdown.Musk is contractually obligated to pay Twitter a $1 billion break-up fee if he does not complete the deal. But the contract also contains a ""specific performance"" clause that a judge can cite to force Musk to complete the deal.In practice, acquirers who lose a specific performance case are almost never forced to complete an acquisition and typically negotiate a monetary settlement with their targets.Wedbush Securities called Musk's citing of the spam accounts as grounds to put the deal on hold a ""dog-ate-the-homework excuse"" given that the company was making the same disclosure on the matter since it went public in 2013.""The stark reality for Twitter is that no other strategic/financial bidder will come near this deal and Musk knows that,"" the Wedbush analysts wrote.(Reporting by Greg Roumeliotis and Krystal Hu in New York.

With over 30 stock-keeping units (SKUs), the brand is said to have catered to over 200,000 consumers.Both the companies confirmed the development.""We will utilize our expertise and proficiency in digital marketing to accelerate the growth and scale growth for Dr. Sheth’s and we are confident that we will make it a 100 cr run rate brand in 2 years,"" said Alagh. ""They (Honasa Consumer) bring a level of operational excellence that will make our expertise and our products accessible to a wider community. Their experience as a house of brands will also help us optimize our innovation and bring about a great range of skincare that combines the best of both worlds - science and nature,"" said Aneesh Sheth, CEO at Dr Sheth’s. Honasa Consumer has been on an acquisition spree as the company is eyeing to build a ‘house of brands,’ a strategy that is fast gaining traction of late.In February this year, Mamaearth bought BBlunt Salons, operated by Bhabani Blunt Hair Dressing Pvt. Ltd, a subsidiary of Godrej Consumer Products Ltd (GCPL), and BBlunt, a hair colour and styling products brand owned by GCPL for Rs 134 crore to make forays into hair color and hairstyling category.In December 2021, Honasa Consumer had bought content platform Momspresso in a bid to expand its consumer engagement strategies.The brand became one of the very few unicorns such as Nykaa and OfBusiness to turn profitable in India. While Honasa Consumer had not managed to clock a profit even at EBITDA (earnings before interest tax depreciation and amortisation) level until FY20, a strong growth in its financials for FY21 suggests that demand for D2C products has surged since the onset of the pandemic.The company currently has a portfolio of 140 products under Mamaearth and 40 products under The Derma Co.Fund-raising activity in the broader beauty and personal care (BPC) segment has risen over the last few months.For instance, earlier this month, content-to-commerce platform, the Good Glamm Group, was said to be in talks with sovereign and pension funds to close a $250 million (Rs 1,911 crore) round of funding.   Naturohabit Pvt. Ltd, which runs personal care brand Nat Habit, has raised $4 million (around Rs 30 crore) in its Series A funding led by Fireside Ventures, along with participation from existing investors a couple of weeks ago.In March, personal care brand Plum raised $35 million as a part of its Series C funding led by growth-stage investor A91 Partners.The same month, VCCircle reported that another personal care brand mCaffeine has raised $15-20 million in a new round of funding from new investor Singularity AMC and existing institutional backer Amicus Capital. Share article on",https://www.vccircle.com//mamaearth-parent-acquires-majority-stake-in-skincare-brand,Merger/Acquisition,"Ltd, the parent company of Mamaearth and The Derma Co, has picked up majority stake in a skincare brand Dr Sheth’s, two individuals familiar with the development told VCCircle.Mamaearth, which turned unicorn last December, has invested around Rs 28 crore in the skincare products maker, which targets the luxury segment.As part of the transaction, Varun Alagh, co-founder of Mamaearth, has also joined Dr Sheth's board, the individuals added.Founded in 2016, Dr Sheth’s manufactures personal care products such as sunscreens, brightening cleansers, anti-oxidant moisturisers, toners, masks, eye creams and peels.While Honasa Consumer had not managed to clock a profit even at EBITDA (earnings before interest tax depreciation and amortisation) level until FY20, a strong growth in its financials for FY21 suggests that demand for D2C products has surged since the onset of the pandemic.The company currently has a portfolio of 140 products under Mamaearth and 40 products under The Derma Co.Fund-raising activity in the broader beauty and personal care (BPC) segment has risen over the last few months.For instance, earlier this month, content-to-commerce platform, the Good Glamm Group, was said to be in talks with sovereign and pension funds to close a $250 million (Rs 1,911 crore) round of funding.   Naturohabit Pvt.","['The Derma Co', 'VCCircle', 'Mamaearth', 'Varun Alagh', 'The Derma Co.Fund', 'Naturohabit\xa0Pvt']","['$250 million', '$4 million', '$35 million', '$15-20 million']"
Holcim to use proceeds from India sale on lower carbon acquisitions,16 May,"Holcim will use cash raised from the sale of its Indian business for acquisitions focused on building products and solutions, Chief Executive Jan Jenisch said on Monday, with the cement-maker currently eyeing 10 potential targets.Holcim agreed to sell its Indian business to Adani Group for 6.4 billion Swiss francs ($6.38 billion), its largest divestment in years, as it seeks to lower its carbon profile and raise funds for takeovers.Over the last 15 months Holcim has spent 5 billion Swiss francs ($4.99 billion) on a string of companies outside the cement market as it pivots towards building products like roofing and mortars.""We hope we can keep a similar pace and put this money to work very fast,"" Chief Executive Jan Jenisch told reporters.""At the moment we have around 10 transactions being checked by us, being negotiated by us. They are small transactions, they are bigger transactions,"" Jenisch told reporter. ""We are ready for another Firestone,"" he said, referring to the $3.4 billion purchase of the American roofing business Holcim made last year.The company would also look at smaller bolt on deals in the aggregates and ready-mix concrete areas, Jenisch said.The sale of the Indian operations, which included 31 cement plants, would lower Holcim's CO2 profile, he added.Making cement is an energy intensive industrial process which produces high levels of carbon, a situation which has deterred many investors and weighed on Holcim's share price.Its shares were indicated 2.9% higher in premarket activity.""Around 26% of our CO2 emissions are in India, so we will have a much reduced CO2 footprint,"" Jenisch said.""We will always make cement, but we will decarbonise cement.

Adani buys Holcim assets for $10.5 bn,16 May,"The Adani family has agreed to buy Swiss building materials maker Holcim Ltd’s India assets Ambuja Cements and ACC Ltd for $10.5 billion (₹80,000 crore) in one of the largest ever acquisitions by an Indian group, the two groups said in a joint statement.The Adani family, through an offshore special purpose vehicle, agreed to acquire 63.19% of Ambuja Cements and 54.53% of ACC, the statement said. The value of the Holcim stake and the open offer consideration for Ambuja Cements and ACC made by Adani Group makes the deal the largest ever acquisition by Adani Group and India’s largest-ever acquisition in the infrastructure and materials space, the statement added.“Our move into the cement business is yet another validation of our belief in our nation’s growth story,” said Gautam Adani, chairman of Adani Group. “Not only is India expected to remain one of the world’s largest demand-driven economies for several decades, India also continues to be the world’s second-largest cement market and yet has less than half of the global average per capita cement consumption. In statistical comparison, China’s cement consumption is over 7X that of India’s.”The acquisition will propel Adani Group to become the second-largest cement maker in India after Aditya Birla Group’s UltraTech Cement Ltd. The acquisition comes even as the government boosts spending on capital expenditure to boost growth. Adani Group plans to build an integrated business model, with the cement business supporting its other infrastructure businesses, including ports, logistics, energy and real estate.Since the acquisition of promoter holdings in the two firms will result in a change of ownership, two separate open offers for public shareholders will be mandatory.Adani Group may spend $3-3.5 billion to buy shares from public shareholders.Adani Group has offered to pay ₹385 per share for Ambuja Cements, a person aware of the development said, requesting anonymity. The shares of Ambuja Cements last traded at ₹358.80 on BSE on Friday.Deutsche Bank, BarCap and Standard Chartered were financiers to the deal. Deutsche Bank was the financial adviser to Adani Group.On 9 May, Mint first reported that Adani is leading the race to buy Holcim’s India assets.With India’s cement consumption at just 242 kg per capita compared to the global average of 525 kg per capita, there is significant potential for the growth of the cement sector in India. The tailwinds of rapid urbanization, the growing middle class and affordable housing, together with the post-pandemic recovery in construction and other infrastructure sectors, are expected to continue driving the growth of the cement sector over the next several decades, the two companies said in the release.Ambuja Cements and ACC have a combined installed production capacity of around 70 million tonnes per annum, with 23 cement plants, 14 grinding stations, 80 ready-mix concrete plants and over 50,000 channel partners across India.Both Ambuja and ACC would benefit from synergies with the integrated Adani infrastructure platform, especially in the areas of raw material, renewable power and logistics, where Adani Portfolio companies have vast experience and deep expertise, the press release said. Adani Group had already actively begun preparing for the mega foray into the cement business by hiring people, creating required divisions and setting up operational facilities.Share article on",https://www.vccircle.com//adani-group-wins-race-to-buy-holcim-s-india-assets,Merger/Acquisition,"The value of the Holcim stake and the open offer consideration for Ambuja Cements and ACC made by Adani Group makes the deal the largest ever acquisition by Adani Group and India’s largest-ever acquisition in the infrastructure and materials space, the statement added.“Our move into the cement business is yet another validation of our belief in our nation’s growth story,” said Gautam Adani, chairman of Adani Group.The tailwinds of rapid urbanization, the growing middle class and affordable housing, together with the post-pandemic recovery in construction and other infrastructure sectors, are expected to continue driving the growth of the cement sector over the next several decades, the two companies said in the release.Ambuja Cements and ACC have a combined installed production capacity of around 70 million tonnes per annum, with 23 cement plants, 14 grinding stations, 80 ready-mix concrete plants and over 50,000 channel partners across India.Both Ambuja and ACC would benefit from synergies with the integrated Adani infrastructure platform, especially in the areas of raw material, renewable power and logistics, where Adani Portfolio companies have vast experience and deep expertise, the press release said.","['Ambuja Cements', 'ACC', 'Adani Group', 'Adani Group', 'Adani Group', 'ACC', 'Ambuja', 'ACC']","['$10.5 billion', '80,000', '$3-3.5 billion', '385']"

India's Reliance to acquire dozens of brands in $6.5 billion consumer goods play,15 May,"India's biggest retailer Reliance will acquire dozens of small grocery and non-food brands as it targets building its own $6.5 billion consumer goods business to challenge foreign giants like Unilever, two sources familiar with the plan told Reuters.Reliance, run by Indian billionaire Mukesh Ambani, plans to build a portfolio of 50 to 60 grocery, household and personal care brands within six months and is hiring an army of distributors to take them to mom-and-pop stores and bigger retail outlets across the nation, the sources added. The consumer goods push under a vertical named Reliance Retail Consumer Brands will come on top of Ambani's brick-and-mortar store network of more than 2,000 grocery outlets and ongoing expansion of ""JioMart"" e-commerce operations in India's nearly $900 billion retail market, one of world's biggest. Reliance is in final stages of negotiations with around 30 popular niche local consumer brands to fully acquire them or form joint venture partnerships for sales, said the first source familiar with its business planning.The total investment outlay planned by the company to acquire brands isn't clear, but the second source said Reliance had set a goal to achieve 500 billion rupees ($6.5 billion) of annual sales from the business within five years. ""Reliance will become a house of brands. This is an inorganic play,"" said the person.Reliance did not respond to a request for comment.With the new business plan, Reliance is seeking to challenge some of the world's biggest consumer groups, like Nestle, Unilever, PepsiCo Inc and Coca-Cola, which have been operating for decades in India, the sources said.It's a daunting task, though, to beat such well-established foreign companies that have their own manufacturing units in India and thousands of distributors who take their world-famous products like Pond's creams or Maggi noodles across the vast nation of 1.4 billion people.Unilever's India unit reported sales of $6.5 billion in the fiscal year ending March 2022, and says that nine out of 10 Indian households use at least one of its brands.""There is a fair bit of brand value which is attached to the established names and it becomes very difficult to compete with them,"" said Alok Shah, a consumer analyst at India's Ambit Capital. ""If inorganic is the route for Reliance, they will be able to scale up much faster. But they'll need to get the pricing and distribution right to compete with bigger rivals.""HIRING, PRODUCT CATEGORIESAs a retail leader, Reliance still garners most consumer goods revenues by selling or distributing products of other rivals at its own supermarkets and mom-and-pop outlet partners. Reliance did develop a few so-called private labels where it hired contract manufacturers to make cola drinks and noodle packs for sale in its own retail network, but that business generates only 35 billion rupees ($450 million) in annual sales, said the second source.Foreign firms had been already uneasy about Reliance's supermarket strategy, where its private labels were competing for shelf space with brands of global rivals, Reuters reported last year.Reliance's new consumer goods push targets deals with popular Indian brands.Among the brands it is in talks with for acquisition or potential joint venture, according to one of the sources, is Sosyo, a soft-drink brand of a near 100-year old Indian company, Hajoori, based in the western state of Gujarat and popular for its flavoured drinks.The company's director, Aliasgar Abbas Hajoori, said in a statement, ""We don't comment on speculations.""LinkedIn profiles reveal how Reliance has been slowly ramping up efforts to expand its consumer business. In recent weeks, it has hired senior executives from companies like Danone and Kellogg Co for quality control and sales.One LinkedIn job ad by Reliance stated it had short-listed staples, personal care, beverages, and chocolates as categories for initial launches, and was hiring mid-level sales managers for the business in more than 100 cities and small towns.Among the main tasks of such executives will be to appoint distributors and manage merchants, the ad stated.Share article on",https://www.vccircle.com//india-s-reliance-to-acquire-dozens-of-brands-in-6-5-billion-consumer-goods-play,Merger/Acquisition,"This is an inorganic play,"" said the person.Reliance did not respond to a request for comment.With the new business plan, Reliance is seeking to challenge some of the world's biggest consumer groups, like Nestle, Unilever, PepsiCo Inc and Coca-Cola, which have been operating for decades in India, the sources said.It's a daunting task, though, to beat such well-established foreign companies that have their own manufacturing units in India and thousands of distributors who take their world-famous products like Pond's creams or Maggi noodles across the vast nation of 1.4 billion people.Unilever's India unit reported sales of $6.5 billion in the fiscal year ending March 2022, and says that nine out of 10 Indian households use at least one of its brands.Reliance did develop a few so-called private labels where it hired contract manufacturers to make cola drinks and noodle packs for sale in its own retail network, but that business generates only 35 billion rupees ($450 million) in annual sales, said the second source.Foreign firms had been already uneasy about Reliance's supermarket strategy, where its private labels were competing for shelf space with brands of global rivals, Reuters reported last year.Reliance's new consumer goods push targets deals with popular Indian brands.Among the brands it is in talks with for acquisition or potential joint venture, according to one of the sources, is Sosyo, a soft-drink brand of a near 100-year old Indian company, Hajoori, based in the western state of Gujarat and popular for its flavoured drinks.The company's director, Aliasgar Abbas Hajoori, said in a statement, ""We don't comment on speculations.","['Reliance', 'Reliance', 'Nestle', 'Unilever', 'PepsiCo Inc', 'Coca-Cola', 'Unilever', 'Reliance', 'Reliance', 'Reuters', 'Reliance', 'Hajoori', 'Aliasgar Abbas Hajoori']","['$6.5 billion', 'nearly $900 billion', '500 billion rupees', '$6.5 billion', '$6.5 billion', '$450 million']"

"Spacetech firm SatSure buys SaaS platform CropTrails, eyes overseas markets",06 May,"Bengaluru-based spacetech startup SatSure Analytics Pvt. Ltd has acquired software-as-a-service (SaaS) platform CropTrails for an undisclosed sum with an aim to foray into overseas markets like Africa, Latin America and Southeast Asia.  The startup in a statement said that it will transform CropTrails into a no-code platform for agribusinesses to prototype and build their in-house tool that can integrate with SatSure Sparta’s datasets. CropTrails was conceptualized and incorporated in the year 2018 by Indore-based startup OEPP Innovations Private Limited. It is a web and android application which is used as an information collecting tool by field officers or supervisors to record and digitize information about farmers, farms and crops.“Farm digitisation tools like CropTrails are necessary for countries such as Nigeria and the Philippines. Thus, this acquisition will help SatSure expand further and strengthen its international market reach into its target geographies in Africa, LATAM and Southeast Asia,” said Prateep Basu, Founder and CEO of SatSure. Founded by Basu, Rashmit Singh Sukhmani and Abhishek Raju in 2017, SatSure is a decision analytics company that leverages advances in satellites and big data analytics to help solve problems at the nexus of sustainability of food, water and energy security. Earlier in February, the spacetech startup raised $5 million (Rs 38 crore) in a pre-Series A round led by Baring Private Equity India and Asian Development Bank's venture arm, ADB Ventures. Last year in November, it raised its first institutional round of funding led by Baring Private Equity India. “Digitisation and traceability are the two pillars on which CropTrails has been built, and SatSure’s competency in generating predictive insights using satellite imagery will only add more value to it,” added Priyan Shah, CEO of OEPP Innovations, the company that incorporated CropTrails.This development comes at a time when the number of spacetech startups in India have doubled in 1 year. According to the Economic Survey 2022, the total number of space startups in the country has crossed 100 with 47 space technology startups being established in the country in 2021, up from 21 in 2020.

"L&T Infotech, Mindtree set to merge creating fifth largest IT service provider",06 May,"After much speculations, Larsen & Toubro Infotech Ltd (LTI) and Mindtree Ltd announced their merger to become one entity “LTI Mindtree”. A Steering Committee will be constituted to oversee the transition till the merger process is complete. On completion of the merger, LTI Mindtree will be India’s fifth largest IT services company by market cap surpassing Tech Mahindra Ltd.The boards of directors of LTI and Mindtree at their respective meetings held on Friday approved “a composite scheme of amalgamation of both these independently listed IT services companies under the Larsen & Toubro (L&T) Group.”The proposed integration will see LTI and Mindtree create an “efficient” and “scaled-up” IT services provider exceeding $3.5 billion, L&T Group said. The transaction is subject to shareholder and regulatory approvals.Current Mindtree chief executive officer and managing director Debashis Chatterjee will lead the combined entity while LTI’s chief executive Sanjay Jalona has resigned citing personal reasons. He will serve his notice period but will not stay on to oversee the integration.Given that recent industry shifts like prominence of large deals and preference for end-to-end offerings are benefitting large players, the two companies have decided that the time is appropriate to combine the strengths of both organizations to better serve the customers.“Significant scale benefits are anticipated through LTI and Mindtree’s complementary strengths resulting in a stronger portfolio of offerings across verticals. Enhanced customer engagement and delivery model through industrialization of delivery and streamlined value-enabling processes is expected to result in improvement in large deal capabilities. These opportunities will create a more distinctive employee value proposition and stronger partnerships with ecosystem players,” L&T Group said in a statement.Upon the scheme becoming effective, all shareholders of Mindtree will be issued shares of LTI at the ratio of 73 shares of LTI for every 100 shares of Mindtree. The new shares of LTI so issued will be traded on the NSE and BSE. L&T Ltd will hold 68.73 % of LTI after the merger. For now, the companies will continue to function independently.“This merger represents our continued commitment to grow the IT services business in line with our strategic vision. The highly complementary businesses of LTI and Mindtree will make this integration a ‘win-win’ proposition for our customers, investors, shareholders, and employees,” said A.M. Naik, chairman, LTI.Speaking about the merger, S. N. Subrahmanyan, vice chairman, LTI, said, “We are confident that the proposed merger will help us build on the combined strengths of both these organizations to unlock synergies through scale, cross-vertical expertise, and talent pool. This will help us emerge as a partner of choice for large-scale tech transformations and create a distinctive employee value proposition.”The merger of LTI and Mindtree makes sense at multiple levels, according to Abhisek Mukherjee, cofounder and director of Auctus Advisors. “Other than the complimentary portfolios of business, that many observers have pointed out, this will create meaningful scale for the combined entity. Scale is becoming a prerequisite to qualify for and win large deals, which is the holy grail for all IT services companies. Better access and conversion of large deals by the combined entity is something to watch out for. This will drive both revenue and margin expansion,“ he pointed out.On the flip side, according to Mukherjee, organizational turbulence is something that challenges such mergers of equals. “Both LTI and Mindtree have deep leadership and how potential overlaps are managed will determine how quickly the combined entity stabilizes,” he said.In 2019, L&T Group had acquired Mindtree in a “hostile” takeover as the founders resisted it and finally resigned from the company.Analysts at IIFL said in an earlier note that both companies have complementary capabilities, verticals and client exposures. “We believe this may not be a bad time for initiating the merger process, as both companies now have a similar growth and margin profile, with a strong FY23 outlook,” the report said.During the March quarter, Mindtree’s net profit stood at ₹473.1 crore up by 49.1% from a year ago while revenue stood at ₹2,897.4 crore rising 37.4%. Meanwhile, LTI posted a net profit of ₹637.5 crore, up 16.8% from a year ago as revenue jumped 31.6% from the previous year to ₹4,301.6 crore.On Friday, shares of Mindtree were down 3.9% to close at ₹3,374.65 while those of LTI were down 3.6% to close at ₹4,593.10 on the BSE.Share article on",https://www.vccircle.com//lti-and-mindtree-merge-to-become-5th-largest-it-services-firm-by-market-cap,Merger/Acquisition,"On completion of the merger, LTI Mindtree will be India’s fifth largest IT services company by market cap surpassing Tech Mahindra Ltd.The boards of directors of LTI and Mindtree at their respective meetings held on Friday approved “a composite scheme of amalgamation of both these independently listed IT services companies under the Larsen & Toubro (L&T) Group.”The proposed integration will see LTI and Mindtree create an “efficient” and “scaled-up” IT services provider exceeding $3.5 billion, L&T Group said.He will serve his notice period but will not stay on to oversee the integration.Given that recent industry shifts like prominence of large deals and preference for end-to-end offerings are benefitting large players, the two companies have decided that the time is appropriate to combine the strengths of both organizations to better serve the customers.“Significant scale benefits are anticipated through LTI and Mindtree’s complementary strengths resulting in a stronger portfolio of offerings across verticals.","['LTI Mindtree', 'Tech Mahindra Ltd.', 'LTI', 'the Larsen & Toubro', 'L&T) Group', 'LTI', 'L&T Group', 'LTI', 'Mindtree']","['$3.5 billion', '473.1', '2,897.4', '637.5', '4,301.6', '3,374.65', '4,593.10']"
M&M may demerge auto business into 3 units – report,06 May,"In a major restructuring move, auto-to-tech conglomerate Mahindra & Mahindra is likely to separate its automotive business into 3 parts, the Economic Times reported Friday. The move will include separating the company’s electric vehicle (EV), tractor and passenger vehicle businesses into 3 separate entities, the report mentioned. The EV business, along with its manufacturing unit in Pune will be clubbed with Italian subsidiary Pininfarina to form a company.  The farm equipment and passenger vehicle businesses are likely to become standalone entities. After M&M acquired Punjab Tractors in 2007, the farm equipment and tractor business of the company is the biggest one in the conglomerate’s automotive business and boasts a 43% market share in the country’s tractor market. According to the report, the main rationale behind the demerger is to unlock value in each of the automotive-related businesses. M&M’s shares traded with a mild cut of 0.3% Friday. Last year, M&M had plans to list Pininfarina – the Italian arm it acquired in 2015 – in the US via a special purpose vehicle (SPV) but is now instead likely to club the company with its EV project.  M&M recorded sales of 45,640 units for the month of April 2022, registering a growth of 25% year-on-year, with passenger vehicles growing 23% and 3-wheeler sales rising 47%. Exports rose 35% year-on-year. Meanwhile, tractor sales saw a robust growth of nearly 50% year-on-year at nearly 41,000 units during April.  The company reported highest-ever quarterly sales of its EV 3-wheelers, Treo Auto and Treo Zor for the quarter-ended December, according to a regulatory filing. Despite commodity inflation and prevailing semiconductor shortage, the auto maker added that it saw a very healthy booking pipeline for its automobile business with the Mahindra XUV 700 registering nearly 1 lakh bookings in 4 months. The country’s second-largest utility vehicle manufacturer sold 22,168 utility vehicles last month versus 18,186 units, up 22% year-on-year. M&M reported a net profit of Rs 3,640 crore for the 9 months-ended FY22 on a low base, registering a rise of nearly 4 times year-on-year. Operating profit (EBITDA) for 9 months of FY22 was marginally higher (up 2%) year-on-year, at Rs 5,097 crore vs Rs 5,016 crore year-on-year, while revenue rose 29% to Rs 40,307 crore vs Rs 31,236 crore year-on-year. Share article on",https://www.vccircle.com//m-m-may-demerge-auto-business-into-3-units-report,Merger/Acquisition,"After M&M acquired Punjab Tractors in 2007, the farm equipment and tractor business of the company is the biggest one in the conglomerate’s automotive business and boasts a 43% market share in the country’s tractor market.Last year, M&M had plans to list Pininfarina – the Italian arm it acquired in 2015 – in the US via a special purpose vehicle (SPV) but is now instead likely to club the company with its EV project.","['M&M', 'Punjab Tractors', 'M&M', 'SPV', 'EV']",[]

Tesla loses $126 billion in value amid Musk's Twitter deal funding concern,27 April,"Tesla Inc lost $126 billion in value on Tuesday amid investor concerns that chief executive Elon Musk may have to sell shares to fund his $21 billion equity contribution to his $44 billion buyout of Twitter Inc.Tesla is not involved in the Twitter deal, yet its shares have been targeted by speculators after Musk declined to disclose publicly where his cash for the acquisition will come from. The 12.2% drop in Tesla's shares on Tuesday equated to a $21 billion drop in the value of his Tesla stake, the same as the $21 billion in cash he committed to the Twitter deal. Wedbush Securities analyst Daniel Ives said that worries about upcoming stock sales by Musk and the possibility that he is becoming distracted by Twitter weighed on Tesla shares. ""This (is) causing a bear festival on the name,"" he said. Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment. To be sure, Tesla's share plunge came against a challenging backdrop for many technology-related stocks. The Nasdaq closed at its lowest level since December 2020 on Tuesday, as investors worried about slowing global growth and more aggressive rate hikes from the U.S. Federal Reserve. Twitter's shares also slid on Tuesday, falling 3.9% to close at $49.68 even though Musk agreed to buy it on Monday for $54.20 per share in cash. The widening spread reflects investor concern that the precipitous decline in Tesla's shares, from which Musk derives the majority of his $239 billion fortune, could lead the world's richest person to have second thoughts about the Twitter deal. ""If Tesla's share price continues to remain in freefall, then it will jeopardize Musk’s financing,"" said OANDA senior market analyst Ed Moya. As part of the Tesla deal, Musk also took out a $12.5 billion margin loan tied to his Tesla stock. He had already borrowed against about half of his Tesla shares. University of Maryland professor David Kirsch, whose research focuses on innovation and entrepreneurship, said investors started to worry about a ‘cascade of margin calls’ on Musk's loans. Share article on",https://www.vccircle.com//tesla-loses-126-billion-in-value-amid-musk-s-twitter-deal-funding-concern,Merger/Acquisition,"Tesla Inc lost $126 billion in value on Tuesday amid investor concerns that chief executive Elon Musk may have to sell shares to fund his $21 billion equity contribution to his $44 billion buyout of Twitter Inc.Tesla is not involved in the Twitter deal, yet its shares have been targeted by speculators after Musk declined to disclose publicly where his cash for the acquisition will come from.The 12.2% drop in Tesla's shares on Tuesday equated to a $21 billion drop in the value of his Tesla stake, the same as the $21 billion in cash he committed to the Twitter deal.","['Tesla Inc', 'Twitter Inc.', 'Tesla', 'Tesla']","['$126 billion', '$21 billion', '$44 billion', '$21 billion', '$21 billion', '49.68', '54.20', '$239 billion', '$12.5 billion']"

"With Twitter in his sights, Musk creates new model of 21st century billionaire",15 April,"With a stable of businesses ranging from electric cars to private rocket ships, iconoclastic billionaire Elon Musk has become the richest person in the world by building a fortune firmly planted in 21st century technology. With an all-cash $43 billion offer to buy Twitter Inc, Musk may soon emulate the tycoons of the past by controlling a media platform that contributed to his rise to fame. Musk, the chief executive of electric car maker Tesla, revealed the takeover bid in a regulatory filing made public on Thursday and said he would take Twitter private.Owning Twitter would be the next evolution of a polarizing figure. Musk has earned Wall Street's admiration and ire by combining the free-flowing obsessions of aerospace visionary Howard Hughes with an intense focus on revolutionizing auto production reminiscent of Henry Ford into a new model of a billionaire who is as likely to take on short-sellers as he is to shoot a red luxury sports car into orbit, as he did in 2018. ""Whatever your feelings on Musk, he would certainly shake things up, with the only question as to whether he would make things worse or improve them,"" said Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets. Musk, 50, has a $273.6 billion fortune estimated by Forbes that makes him the wealthiest person in the world, worth $92.3 billion more than runner-up Jeff Bezos of Amazon.com Inc. Musk was born in Pretoria, South Africa to a Canadian mother and South African father and later attended the University of Pennsylvania, where he graduated in 1997. He did not invent rockets or electric cars, nor did he found Tesla, which he has led from 2008. But his insight that Tesla's electric cars should be high-performance machines with sophisticated, smartphone-style software revolutionized the global auto business, prompting established companies to try to catch up while spurring new, all-electric competitors such as startup Rivian. While many initially expected Tesla to fail - which it almost did during the 2008-2009 financial crisis and in 2017-2018 when it stumbled through what Musk called ""manufacturing hell"" in the launch of its high-volume Model 3 sedan - the company began turning quarterly profits in 2020. Wall Street has underscored Tesla's achievement by lifting the company's market capitalization to more than $1 trillion - more than all three Detroit automakers plus Toyota Motor Corp, combined - and making it the fourth-largest company in the benchmark S&P 500 index, the backbone of millions of Americans' retirement savings plans. At the same time, his company SpaceX, led day to day by President Gwynne Shotwell, has upended space launch industry incumbents by developing rockets capable of putting satellites into space and returning to Earth for re-use.Perhaps more than any other person, Musk has helped bring bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies into the mainstream, with Tesla holding about $2 billion in bitcoin on its balance sheet and the company among the few to accept dogecoin as payment. Musk has run through a trail of subordinates who could not keep pace or got fed up with his relentless demands. Even his largest shareholders have appeared to lose patience with him at times. Noted stock picker Cathie Wood, whose outsized position in Tesla powered her ARK Innovation ETF to the best performance of any U.S. fund in 2020, suggested at a conference on Tuesday that she is put off by Musk's ""antics"" and has little contact with him personally. Labor advocates have criticized Musk for hostility toward unions. Musk has also clashed with former business associates, state and federal regulators, and Wall Street figures such as short seller Jim Chanos of Kynikos Associates. Chanos came under fire from Musk for suggesting that Musk's production estimates for Tesla and his tunnel business The Boring Company were unattainable. ""What bothers me is not so much the personal stuff and the personal attacks. I'm used to that. It's the willingness to say things that I think he knows are a stretch, to be polite,"" Chanos told CNBC in 2018. Reuters, too, has faced his ire, with Musk tweeting in 2018 https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1014800936198213633 that a reporter misled the public about Model 3 production and ""followed that up with mean tweet to me"" on his birthday.GLOBAL REACHTwitter helped Musk become a household name. He has 81 million followers and built a pop culture following large enough to help him earn a spot hosting the venerable U.S. comedy TV show ""Saturday Night Live"" in 2021. A Twitter takeover would add Musk to the long line of U.S. business tycoons who solidified their fortunes with media properties, ranging from William Randolph Hearst in the late 19th century to Jack Welch's 1986 decision to buy the parent company of broadcast network NBC while he was chief executive of General Electric. Musk has used Twitter to go after short-sellers large and small. He also has posted everything from Dad jokes to polls on what he should do with his unrealized gains from Tesla's surging stock price. His Twitter content has been the source of an ongoing battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commision. Musk is bound by a 2018 settlement with the agency requiring him to obtain pre-approval on some Twitter posts after he tweeted that he had ""funding secured"" to take Tesla private. The SEC said he defrauded investors, though the settlement included no admission by Musk or an indication of innocence. Musk has since accused the SEC of ""unrelenting harassment."" ""Twitter has been intertwined with Musk's global reach, which is why he feels so passionately about the platform,"" said Dan Ives, an analyst at Wedbush Securities. ""But for the Twitter board this is a living nightmare because unless they want to eat lawsuits for breakfast they have to find another bidder.""Share article on",https://www.vccircle.com//with-twitter-in-his-sights-musk-creates-new-model-of-21st-century-billionaire,Merger/Acquisition,"Musk has earned Wall Street's admiration and ire by combining the free-flowing obsessions of aerospace visionary Howard Hughes with an intense focus on revolutionizing auto production reminiscent of Henry Ford into a new model of a billionaire who is as likely to take on short-sellers as he is to shoot a red luxury sports car into orbit, as he did in 2018.At the same time, his company SpaceX, led day to day by President Gwynne Shotwell, has upended space launch industry incumbents by developing rockets capable of putting satellites into space and returning to Earth for re-use.Perhaps more than any other person, Musk has helped bring bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies into the mainstream, with Tesla holding about $2 billion in bitcoin on its balance sheet and the company among the few to accept dogecoin as payment.",['Tesla'],"['$43 billion', '$273.6 billion', '$92.3 billion', 'more than $1 trillion', 'about $2 billion']"
Elon Musk swoops on Twitter with $41 billion cash offer,14 April,"Elon Musk took aim at Twitter with a $41 billion cash offer on Thursday, prompting a spike in shares of the social media giant, which the Tesla CEO said needs to be taken private to grow and become a platform for free speech.""Twitter has extraordinary potential. I will unlock it,"" Musk said in a letter to Twitter's board on Wednesday, which was made public in a regulatory filing on Thursday.Musk's offer price of $54.20 per share represents a 38% premium to Twitter's April 1 close, the last trading day before the Tesla chief executive's stake of more than 9% in the social media platform was made public.The billionaire rejected an offer to join Twitter's board this week after disclosing his stake, a move which analysts said signaled his intention to take over the company as a board seat would have limited his stake to just under 15%.""Since making my investment I now realize the company will neither thrive nor serve this societal imperative in its current form. Twitter needs to be transformed as a private company,"" Musk said in his letter to Twitter Chairman Bret Taylor.Musk, who calls himself a free-speech absolutist, has been critical of the social media platform and its policies, and recently ran a poll on Twitter asking users if they believed it adheres to the principle of free speech.""My offer is my best and final offer and if it is not accepted, I would need to reconsider my position as a shareholder,"" Musk added.Twitter will review the offer with advice from Goldman Sachs and Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati, a source told Reuters.Shares in Twitter jumped 12% in premarket trading, while those of Tesla fell about 1%. Based on Twitter's Wednesday closing price of $45.85, its price in pre-market trading in New York implied a 35% chance of the company accepting Musk's offer.The total deal value of $41 billion was calculated based on 763.58 million shares outstanding, according to Refinitiv data.Musk said U.S. investment bank Morgan Stanley was acting as financial adviser for his offer. He did not say how he would finance the transaction if it goes ahead.'SERIAL UNDERPERFORMER'""The big question for the Twitter board now is whether to accept a very generous offer for a business that has been a serial underperformer and tends to treat its users with indifference,"" Michael Hewson, Chief Market analyst at CMC Markets, said after the announcement of Musk's offer.Musk has amassed more than 80 million followers since joining Twitter in 2009 and has used it to make several announcements, including teasing a go-private deal for Tesla that landed him in hot water with regulators.He has also been sued by former Twitter shareholders who claim they missed out on the recent run-up in its stock price because he waited too long to disclose his stake.Twitter's lower-than-expected user additions in recent months have raised doubts about its growth prospects, even as it pursues big projects such as audio chat rooms and newsletters.""It would be hard for any other bidders/consortium to emerge and the Twitter board will be forced likely to accept this bid and/or run an active process to sell Twitter,"" Wedbush Securities analyst Daniel Ives wrote in a client note.""There will be host of questions around financing, regulatory, balancing Musk's time (Tesla, SpaceX) in the coming days but ultimately based on this filing it is a now or never bid for Twitter to accept,"" Ives said.Share article on",https://www.vccircle.com//elon-musk-swoops-on-twitter-with-41-billion-cash-offer,Merger/Acquisition,"I will unlock it,"" Musk said in a letter to Twitter's board on Wednesday, which was made public in a regulatory filing on Thursday.Musk's offer price of $54.20 per share represents a 38% premium to Twitter's April 1 close, the last trading day before the Tesla chief executive's stake of more than 9% in the social media platform was made public.The billionaire rejected an offer to join Twitter's board this week after disclosing his stake, a move which analysts said signaled his intention to take over the company as a board seat would have limited his stake to just under 15%.'SERIAL UNDERPERFORMER'""The big question for the Twitter board now is whether to accept a very generous offer for a business that has been a serial underperformer and tends to treat its users with indifference,"" Michael Hewson, Chief Market analyst at CMC Markets, said after the announcement of Musk's offer.Musk has amassed more than 80 million followers since joining Twitter in 2009 and has used it to make several announcements, including teasing a go-private deal for Tesla that landed him in hot water with regulators.He has also been sued by former Twitter shareholders who claim they missed out on the recent run-up in its stock price because he waited too long to disclose his stake.Twitter's lower-than-expected user additions in recent months have raised doubts about its growth prospects, even as it pursues big projects such as audio chat rooms and newsletters.","['Tesla', 'CMC Markets', 'Tesla']","['$41 billion', '54.20', '45.85', '$41 billion', 'more than 80 million']"

Mufin Finance buys BSE-listed APM Finvest for Rs 76 cr,13 April,"Mufin Finance, operated by Hindon Mercantile Ltd, on Wednesday said it has acquired BSE-listed APM Finvest for Rs 76 crore.   The transactions aim to create India’s first financing ecosystem for the fast-growing electric vehicle (EV) market, it said. The deal comes on the back after Mufin Finance acquired Rupee Circle, a P2P (peer-to-peer) non-banking financial company, in June 2021.   Founded in May 2016 APM Finvest is a part of Rajgharia Group of Industries. The company operates a lending business by providing business loans to SMEs and corporates.  India's EV market is estimated to reach $206 billion by 2030 if the country maintains steady progress to meet its ambitious target of 100 per cent electrification by that year, the company said citing a study by CEEW-Centre for Energy Finance (CEEW-CEF).   Mufin Finance has set a target of disbursing Rs 100 crore in the next three months, intending to disburse Rs 500 crore in the next 12-15 months to capture roughly 30% of the country's current addressable market.  ""We envision to promote faster adoption and manufacturing of electric vehicles in India by creating the nation's first holistic EV financing ecosystem that will include financing options not just for electric vehicles but also for creating charging infrastructure and battery financing,"" said Kapil Garg, Co-Founder, Mufin Finance.   He added, ""There is no doubt that growth in the EV industry is on an upward tick, but it has much ground to cover to meet India's ambitious target of maximum electrification by 2030, and we believe that a dedicated financing ecosystem for the Indian populace will be a strong push for the same."" Electric vehicle sales in India, which include scooters, e-rickshaws, SUVs, and electric buses, are predicted to reach a million units in 2022, about five times what they were in 2021, the statement said.   Mufin Finance, a subsidiary of Hindon Mercantile Limited (HML), was established in 2016 and has since given loans totalling over Rs 1,500 crore. Mufin Finance offers Indian customers the convenience of processing, documenting, and disbursing loans through a quick and digital process. Share article on",https://www.vccircle.com//mufin-finance-buys-bse-listed-apm-finvest-for-rs-76-cr,Merger/Acquisition,"Mufin Finance has set a target of disbursing Rs 100 crore in the next three months, intending to disburse Rs 500 crore in the next 12-15 months to capture roughly 30% of the country's current addressable market.He added, ""There is no doubt that growth in the EV industry is on an upward tick, but it has much ground to cover to meet India's ambitious target of maximum electrification by 2030, and we believe that a dedicated financing ecosystem for the Indian populace will be a strong push for the same.""","['Mufin Finance', 'EV']","['$206 billion', '100 per cent']"

However, the values were undisclosed on most deals. Q1 2022 had just one private equity-backed IPO (initial public offering) compared to 10 in Q1 2021. The largest exits in the quarter include CPPIB selling its 2% stake in Kotak Mahindra Bank for $893 million. This was followed by the $800 million exit from IGT solutions by AION.   The financial services sector dominated the value of exits with 11 deals worth $1.5 billion followed by the technology sector with $1.1 billion worth 12 deals.   “PE/VC exits recorded the lowest value in the past five quarters at $4 billion in the absence of large strategic and secondary deals. Moreover, a drought in PE-backed IPOs has further dampened the value of PE/VC exits. Nonetheless, the past three months have recorded a rising trend in the number of exits despite the absence of PE-backed IPOs. Also, Q1 22 had many strategic exits where the deal values were not disclosed, thereby suppressing the reported aggregate exit value,” said Vivek Soni, Partner and National Leader Private Equity Services, EY.   The quarter saw fundraise up to $4.6 billion against $1.7 raised in Q1 2021.

Mosambee today caters to a wide array of businesses, from SMEs to private and government entities to leading banking institutions in India. With the extensive reach of Pine Labs and their portfolio companies, we aim to continue to deliver strong profitability and breakthrough solutions to our clients,” said Sameer Chugh, Co-Founder of Mosambee.Pine Labs has been active in M&A (mergers and acquisitions), and it has struck a few acquisitions in the recent past. In February it acquired out payments startup Qfix Infocomm, for an undisclosed amount. Earlier, Mint reported that Pine Labs is in advanced negotiations to acquire API infrastructure company Setu.     Pine Labs had previously acquired QwikCilver in 2019 for which it raised capital from Actis Advisors. In the past, the company acquired Southeast Asia-based fintech platform Fave for $45 million (Rs 337 crore) in April 2021.    In July 2020, Pine Labs made a strategic investment in Fave.   The fintech unicorn (startups valued at over $1 billion) raised $50 million (around Rs 380 crore) in fresh funding from Vitruvian Partners. The startup is said to have been valued at $5-$5.5 billion for the said transaction.Last month, Pine Labs raised $150 million (about Rs 1,120 crore) from Alpha Wave Ventures. In May 2021, the company raised a tranche of $285 million from a clutch of reputed public market-focused cross-over funds, pushing its valuation to around $3 billion. In August 2021, Pine Labs roped in CRED founder Kunal Shah on its board.   Earlier VCCircle reported that Pine Labs may defer the IPO process till later this year due to ""weak market sentiments"". It was planning to launch its Nasdaq listing process in January-February and had hired Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley to formalize the process.     Rajul Garg launched Pine Labs in 1998, but later left the company. Its current Chairman Lokvir Kapoor then took over the firm.Pine Labs’ solutions are used by merchants from diverse sectors—electronics, food and beverage, fashion, pharmacy, telecom and airlines, but these are mostly offline players.The company is also planning to ramp up its online platform, both by organic and inorganic means.Share article on",https://www.vccircle.com//ipo-bound-pine-labs-buys-majority-stake-in-payment-solutions-firm-mosambee,Merger/Acquisition,"In February, Mosambee acquired buy-now-pay-later (BNPL)-focused payment startup Benow to deepen its presence across the country.The company had then claimed its revenue has jumped from Rs 2 crore to around Rs 140 crore in four years.With the extensive reach of Pine Labs and their portfolio companies, we aim to continue to deliver strong profitability and breakthrough solutions to our clients,” said Sameer Chugh, Co-Founder of Mosambee.Pine Labs has been active in M&A (mergers and acquisitions), and it has struck a few acquisitions in the recent past.","['Pine Labs', 'Sameer Chugh', 'Co-Founder']","['$100 million', '$45 million', 'over $1 billion', '$50 million', '$5-$5.5 billion', '$150 million', '$285 million', 'around $3 billion']"

Gupshup acquires VC-backed Active.ai; eyes $100-200 mn in pre-IPO round,05 April,"Conversational messaging platform Gupshup, operated by Webaroo Inc., has acquired conversational AI platform for banks and fintech companies Active.Ai and is in talks with potential investors for a pre-IPO funding of $100-200 million or even larger, a top executive told VCCircle.Beerud Sheth, Co-founder and CEO, Gupshup, said that the “mid-sized” acquisition involved mostly cash”. “We wanted the founders of Active.AI and employees to continue,” he added. Other institutional investors have exited in the process.Founded in 2016 by Ravi Shankar, Shankar Narayanan and Parikshit Paspulati, Active.ai had raised funding from Kalaari Capital, Chiratae Ventures, Vertex Ventures, Creditease Holdings and Dream Incubator, among others.Headquartered in Singapore, Active.Ai serves banking, financial BFSI customers across 43 countries with a Conversational Banking as a Service (CBaaS) platform that helps clients engage with millions of consumers.“Gupshup and Active.Ai have a very high customer overlap as a lot of our banking customers use Acitve.ai for developing chat bots and so on,” noted Sheth, “So this acquisition accelerates our ability to do this specialised capability in the BFSI vertical which was part of our roadmap anyway,” he added.This is Gupshup’s second acquisition in 2022. Earlier in February it acquired cloud telephony company Knowlarity Communications, which is backed investors such as Sequoia Capital and Mayfield.In September last year, Gupshup bought New Jersey-based rich communications services (RCS) startup Dotgo.Sheth said that a couple of more acquisitions are in the pipeline without disclosing further details.He also said that Gupshup is in talks with potential investors to raise a pre-IPO funding round ahead of its US listing plans, which it has been vocal about for some time now. “The IPO if we are lucky could happen by even later this year or next year,” he said. The company will start “figuring out” bankers for the planned IPO by the middle of this year.The company expects to raise $100-200 million in primary funding as part of its pre-IPO round. “But if there's more demand, we'll see if some of our existing investors want to sell, and then we can do a secondary transaction as well like last year,” he added.In April 2021, Gupshup raised primary funding of $100 million from Tiger Global. This funding round turned Gupshup into a unicorn, which are private companies that have a valuation of at least $1 billion. Few months down the line in July, Gupshup secured an additional $240 million in its Series F round of funding that also paved the way for exit of early investors.Sheth underlined that the pre-IPO funding is not being done to fund its acquisitions or run its operations as it has adequate cash.“It would be nice to do another round of funding before an IPO. That would be sort of an opportunity rather than a need because unlike many other companies we continue to grow and are profitable,” he added.He also said that existing investors are going to be supportive in terms of reinvesting in the future round but it is keen to get new investors on its cap table.“We are looking to expand the base of investors and the right kind of investors would be sort of a long-term holder who will invest before and after an IPO as well. So, you want to get new names on the table,” he added.Founded in 2004 as Webaroo Inc by Sheth and Rakesh Mathur, Gupshup pivoted from being an offline search engine to a business-to-business (b2b) customer engagement platform across SMS and other channels.  In its current form, Gupshup enables digital commerce businesses with conversational messaging across channels. On the customer-front, the conversational journey enables product discovery, payment, delivery tracking, feedback and support among other features.Share article on",https://www.vccircle.com//gupshup-acquires-vc-backed-active-ai-eyes-100-200-mn-in-pre-ipo-round,Merger/Acquisition,"Other institutional investors have exited in the process.Founded in 2016 by Ravi Shankar, Shankar Narayanan and Parikshit Paspulati, Active.ai had raised funding from Kalaari Capital, Chiratae Ventures, Vertex Ventures, Creditease Holdings and Dream Incubator, among others.Headquartered in Singapore, Active.Ai serves banking, financial BFSI customers across 43 countries with a Conversational Banking as a Service (CBaaS) platform that helps clients engage with millions of consumers.“Gupshup and Active.Ai have a very high customer overlap as a lot of our banking customers use Acitve.ai for developing chat bots and so on,” noted Sheth, “So this acquisition accelerates our ability to do this specialised capability in the BFSI vertical which was part of our roadmap anyway,” he added.This is Gupshup’s second acquisition in 2022.That would be sort of an opportunity rather than a need because unlike many other companies we continue to grow and are profitable,” he added.He also said that existing investors are going to be supportive in terms of reinvesting in the future round but it is keen to get new investors on its cap table.“We are looking to expand the base of investors and the right kind of investors would be sort of a long-term holder who will invest before and after an IPO as well.","['Parikshit Paspulati', 'Active.ai', 'Kalaari Capital', 'Chiratae Ventures', 'Vertex Ventures', 'Creditease Holdings and Dream Incubator', 'BFSI', 'BFSI', 'IPO']","['100', '100', '$100 million', 'at least $1 billion', 'an additional $240 million']"
"HDFC Bank, HDFC to merge in mother of all M&A deals",05 April,"HDFC Bank Ltd, India’s most valuable lender, agreed to acquire its parent and the country’s largest mortgage lender for about $64 billion in an all-stock deal to create a $160 billion financial services behemoth that will be better positioned to tap soaring demand for home loans.The merger, expected to close in 18 months, would significantly widen the bank’s lead over rival private sector peers ICICI Bank Ltd and Axis Bank Ltd in terms of total assets. Based on data as of 31 December, the merged HDFC Bank would have a loan book of ₹17.9 trillion, much ahead of ₹8.14 trillion of ICICI Bank and ₹6.65 trillion of Axis Bank. India’s largest lender State Bank of India (SBI), had total loans of ₹26.64 trillion at the end of December.The merger of the two entities comes as the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) steadily tightens norms for non-bank lenders to bring them on par with banks, leaving little incentive for large shadow banks to operate independently. The combined entity will benefit from adding a large portfolio of mortgages amid a spike in demand for home loans.“The merger makes the combined entity strong enough not only to counter competition but to make the mortgage offering even more competitive,” said Deepak Parekh, chairman of Housing Development Finance Corp. Ltd (HDFC).While a deal of this nature has been speculated for several years, Parekh said the merger makes more sense now due to the changing regulatory landscape. The arbitrage enjoyed by non-bank lenders in terms of regulations has been diminishing as RBI looks to harmonize norms across categories of lenders. Experts said this could also send out a message to other large non-banks to look at converting into a bank.Investors cheered the announcement, with HDFC and HDFC Bank shares surging 9.3% and 9.97%, respectively, at the end of trading on Monday, paring some of gains in intraday trading. The combined entity’s estimated ₹12.1 trillion market value would bring it within snapping distance of India’s second most valuable company, Tata Consultancy Services Ltd. Reliance Industries will remain India’s most valuable company.According to the merger terms, shareholders of the mortgage lender will receive 42 equity shares of HDFC Bank for every 25 shares they hold. HDFC’s current stake of 21% in the bank will be extinguished, and HDFC Bank will be fully owned by public shareholders. Existing shareholders of the mortgage lender will own 41% of the bank after the merger.Parekh, a veteran banker, would not be on the board of the consolidated entity owing to age-related restrictions. HDFC’s current chief executive Keki Mistry will be a director on the board but not a full-time executive.Calling the deal a coming together of equals, Parekh said customers of both the mortgage lender and the bank will be the biggest beneficiaries. While HDFC’s customers will now have access to a wider gamut of products and services, the bank’s customers will have better access to home loans. Around 70% of HDFC customers do not have bank accounts with HDFC Bank, and about 80% of HDFC Bank customers do not have mortgages from the group.The proposal will now require a string of approvals from RBI, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi), the Competition Commission of India (CCI), the National Housing Bank (NHB), the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI), the Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA), shareholders and others.The nod from RBI will be keenly watched by investors, given that the bank will now have sizeable stakes in insurance entities, something the regulator is known to be uncomfortable about.“The bank will end up owning 48% in the life insurer, about 50% in the general insurance and 69% in the asset management company (AMC) entities of the group. Very recently, RBI did not allow Axis Bank to directly own over 10% in Max Life, and ICICI Bank was asked to bring down shareholding in ICICI Lombard to below 30%,” analysts at Macquarie said in a note on Monday.Experts pointed out that while this deal would widen HDFC Bank’s suite of products and allow better cross-selling, it could impact the bank’s profitability. The regulatory capital buffer requirements—statutory liquidity ratio and cash reserve ratio—would increase. It is estimated that HDFC Bank will have an excess SLR/CRR asset requirement of ₹70,000-80,000 crore and will also need an incremental ₹90,000 crore agriculture portfolio to meet priority sector lending norms, according to Macquarie Research.“If you look at the excess (capital buffer) we have, not just from a regulatory requirement perspective, but from the capital cushion point of view, the number probably is already there,” said Sashidhar Jagdishan, MD & CEO, HDFC Bank. Jagdishan will remain the chief executive of the merged entity.Meanwhile, Parekh told reporters the lender had requested RBI to allow staggered compliance with the capital buffer requirements for existing assets over two-three years, although new loans will be compliant with SLR-CRR regulations. “These are open questions that depend on how RBI responds to our letter,” he said.Share article on",https://www.vccircle.com//hdfc-bank-hdfc-merge-in-mother-of-all-m-a-deals,Merger/Acquisition,"The combined entity will benefit from adding a large portfolio of mortgages amid a spike in demand for home loans.“The merger makes the combined entity strong enough not only to counter competition but to make the mortgage offering even more competitive,” said Deepak Parekh, chairman of Housing Development Finance Corp.

"PVR, Inox to merge, creating cinema giant",28 March,"The boards of PVR Ltd and Inox Leisure Ltd, India’s top two multiplex chains, approved an all-stock merger of the companies on Sunday to create India’s largest film exhibition entity with a network of more than 1,500 screens.While existing multiplex screens will retain their brands, new cinemas opened post the merger will be branded as PVR Inox, PVR told stock exchanges on Sunday. The merged entity will be named PVR Inox Ltd.After the merger, Inox promoters will own a 16.66% stake in the combined entity, while PVR founders will own 10.62%. PVR’s chairman and managing director Ajay Bijli would serve as managing director of the merged entity, and Sanjeev Kumar Bijli would be executive director.Pavan Kumar Jain, chairman of Inox, would be appointed non-executive chairman. The company’s director, Siddharth Jain, would be appointed non-executive non-independent director in the combined entity. The board of the merged company would have 10 directors, and both the promoter families will have equal representation with two board seats each.The consolidation in the industry comes after pandemic-led closures of theatres and the rise in popularity of streaming platforms. The cash crunch caused by the prolonged closures has made it tough for cinema chains to invest in new properties and easier to partner with rivals to ramp up screen count, analysts said.“There is no question that the (film exhibition) industry did get impacted by the pandemic, being one of the few businesses around the world that were down to zero revenues. However, we believe in the long-term story of the theatrical business, and mergers have always been on the table because this industry is about consolidation and scale,” Ajay Bijli, chairman and managing director of PVR, said in an interview.The merger will give the industry the impetus to make up for losses of the past two years and build scale in the form of more cinema openings, Bijli added. However, challenges for the industry continue to exist in the form of deep-pocketed over-the-top (OTT) video streaming behemoths, Bijli said, and the consumer is now used to watching content at home.The merged company will operate 1,546 screens across 341 properties and 109 cities. The merger is subject to approvals from the shareholders of Inox and PVR and other regulators, the two companies said in a statement.Consulting firm EY was the exclusive financial adviser for the transaction.Together, the two companies are looking at opening 180-200 new screens every year, especially in small towns and the hinterland, which are grossly under-screened, he added.Siddharth Jain, director of Inox Leisure Ltd, said the purpose of the merger is to remain committed to the theatrical business and restart investments. He added that approval from the markets regulator and shareholders could take between six to nine months.Inox Leisure Ltd is part of the Inox Group, an Indian conglomerate with interests in wind energy, renewables and speciality chemicals.Karan Taurani, an analyst at Elara Capital Ltd, said the merged entity would have a share of 42% (Hindi and English content), which would be tough to rival, apart from a screen share of 50% within the Indian multiplex space and a broad presence across India.“PVR is stronger in the north, west and south whereas Inox has more screens in the east. The combined entity may gain from smaller chains and single screens that have struggled due to the covid situation,” Taurani said.A trade analyst who did not want to be named said while consolidation was on the cards for all multiplex chains, only a merger of the top three players—PVR, INOX and Cinepolis—made sense. Other players like Miraj either have limited presence or, as in the case of Carnival Cinemas, have accumulated much debt. However, the merger is likely to put filmmakers at a disadvantage. “The combined entity may dictate shows and screen timings to producers or may even ask for a higher share of box office revenue,” the person pointed out.According to a recent report by media consulting firm Ormax, cumulative gross box office collections for 2020 and 2021 in India totalled just ₹5,757 crore, almost 50% (and ₹5,000 crore) lower than what the country’s film industry had grossed in 2019 alone. Earlier this month, media reports suggested PVR was looking at merging with the Indian arm of Mexican theatre chain Cinepolis.

Ola to buy fintech firm Avail Finance to strengthen financial services biz,25 March,"SoftBank-backed ANI Technologies Pvt Ltd, which operates cab ride-hailing aggregator platform Ola Cabs, has agreed to buy neobanking platform Avail Finance that provides financial services to the blue collared workforce, the company said in a statement on Thursday.Ola did not reveal the amount of the acquisition and said that the deal is subject to shareholder approval. However, news portal Moneycontrol reported that the deal is a share-swap transaction, worth $50 million. Incidentally, Ola is already an investor in Avail Finance, which was founded in 2017 by Ankush Aggarwal, Bhavish Aggarwal’s brother, along with Tushar Mehndiratta. Bhavish Aggarwal is the founder of Ola’s parent ANI Technologies Pvt Ltd.Besides Ola, the financial services firm counts Falcon Edge and Matrix Partners as its investors. Recently, Avail Finance had acquired YeLo, a neobank operating in the same segment, and is also seeking the regulator’s nod to purchase non-bank lender Art Climate Finance (India) Pvt. Ltd, Mint had reported in November.The startup, as per the report, is circumventing a key Reserve Bank of India (RBI) rule that allows only banks and non-banking finance companies (NBFCs) to lend. The regulation is not stringent for smaller NBFCs and they can get away with several audit and reporting requirements that the bigger companies are required to follow.Avail Finance, operated by Avali Financial Services Ltd, claims to have over 6 million users. The acquisition will enhance Ola’s push into the fintech space, the company said as it looks to build a mobility focused financial services business under Ola Financial Services. With this acquisition Ola Financial Services will further strengthen its play in the ‘credit underserved segments’ that comprises blue collar workers such as Ola’s driver partner ecosystem, Ola said. Ola will leverage Avail Finance’s products and capabilities, which will enhance Ola’s lending business and help Ola expand into neobanking products. Ola’s fintech business will be augmented by Avail Finance’s leadership team with experience in the consumer lending industry, along with a strong technical team across tech, product and design, data science and analytics amongst others, Ola said. With this expansion Ola will be able to cross sell multiple lending products to its large driver partner base by providing them a one-stop destination for all their financial needs, Ola said. Further, Ola said it had recently invested nearly Rs 800 crore into its financial services business and claimed that the business was showing strong growth across its lending and insurance verticals. Ola Postpaid, its BNPL (buy-now-pay-later) offering is available to 40 million customers, Ola said.  Ola, which also manufactures electric scooters under Ola Electric Mobility Pvt Ltd, also said its vehicle financing business is growing rapidly in conjunction with Ola Electric and Ola Cars, its used-car business. Ola said it has built a first-of-its-kind embedded motor insurance journey for Ola Electric and Ola Cars, where customers can select insurance and add-ons like roadside assistance or zero depreciation within the buying journey. Recently, Ola had raised Rs 150 crore as a part of its Series J round from Axis Growth Avenues AIF and Arrow Multi-Asset Fund at a valuation of over $7 billion. However, the company, which had plans to go public in 2022, seems to have pushed back its IPO (initial public offering) plans amid global volatility. Reportedly, the company was also mulling a private market fundraise at a lower valuation of around $5 billion. Ola’s strengthening of financial services business and forays into neobanking comes at a time when many technology startups across sectors in India are looking to add lending and credit to their product range. Ant Group-backed Zomato had recently said that it will set up a wholly-owned non-banking finance company (NBFC). While Zomato did not disclose the purpose behind it, reportedly, the food aggregator and delivery platform is looking to offer BNPL services to its customers through the NBFC. Early this year, VCCircle had reported how India’s new-age financial technology services companies are increasingly launching neobanking platforms to offer credit and other banking solutions to customers in a bid to expand market share. Many technology companies, including Ola, are also diversifying their offerings in a bid to provide users with an integrated one-stop application for routine needs. Ola, in January, had rebranded its quick commerce business as Ola Dash and had said that it plans to set up 500 so-called dark stores, or warehouses that do not have retail storefronts, in the next six months across 20 Indian cities amid rising competition for quick commerce in the country. Share article on",https://www.vccircle.com//ola-to-buy-fintech-firm-avail-finance-to-strengthen-financial-services-biz,Merger/Acquisition,"SoftBank-backed ANI Technologies Pvt Ltd, which operates cab ride-hailing aggregator platform Ola Cabs, has agreed to buy neobanking platform Avail Finance that provides financial services to the blue collared workforce, the company said in a statement on Thursday.Ola did not reveal the amount of the acquisition and said that the deal is subject to shareholder approval.Ola, in January, had rebranded its quick commerce business as Ola Dash and had said that it plans to set up 500 so-called dark stores, or warehouses that do not have retail storefronts, in the next six months across 20 Indian cities amid rising competition for quick commerce in the country.","['SoftBank', 'ANI Technologies Pvt Ltd']","['$50 million', 'over $7 billion', 'around $5 billion']"

Blinkit to merge with Zomato in all-stock deal,15 March,"Blinkit is set to merge with online food aggregator and delivery platform Zomato that will result in the quick commerce company losing its unicorn tag in less than a year and may dampen investor euphoria around the concept of 10-minute delivery service model.The transaction involves an all-stock deal that values Blinkit between $700 million and $800 million, two people familiar with the development told VCCircle.This means Blinkit (formerly Grofers) will lose its unicorn status it had achieved last year after getting over $120 million from Zomato and existing investor Tiger Global Management, Mint reported in August. Unicorns are private companies with a valuation of at least $1 billion and Grofers was one of the over 40 unicorns created in India last year.The merger with Zomato is expected to be completed in 60 days, the people said. SoftBank, which had a 40% stake in Blinkit, will approximately get a 4-5% stake in Zomato as part of the transaction while Tiger Global and Sequoia Capital will get additional shares in the entity, they added without disclosing further details.An email sent to Zomato, Blinkit, Softbank, Sequoia and Tiger Global did not elicit an immediate response.In a late filing with the stock exchanges on Tuesday, Zomato said that it will extend loan of $150 million to Blinkit in one or more tranches.""This loan will support the capital requirements of Grofers India Pvt Ltd in the near term and is in line with our stated intent of investing up to $400 million cash in quick commerce in India over the next two years,"" it added.Blinkit's short lived unicorn status is expected to not just raise questions about the cash guzzling quick commerce industry but may also cast a shadow over the startup ecosystem after a euphoric 2021 on the back of big-bang initial public offerings (IPO) of technology startups, large mergers and acquisitions (M&As), and an accelerated pace of creation of unicorns. Zomato itself became the first tech unicorn to be listed on the bourses last year.After achieving the unicorn status last year, Blinkit's co-founder and chief executive Albinder Dhindsa told Mint that it is undergoing a massive transition as it sought to bet big on making all deliveries under 10 minutes. Soon, it rebranded itself to Blinkit to focus on its pivot to quick commerce in December. Meanwhile, new and older startups also joined the quick commerce bandwagon as 10-minute delivery service became the buzzword. For instance, Zepto, a 10-minute grocery delivery app founded by 18-year-old dropouts of computer science degree course at Stanford University last year, raised $100 million (around Rs 758 crore) in a Series C funding round led by American technology startup accelerator Y Combinator’s Continuity Fund in December. This funding round came 45 days after the company announced its $60 million fundraise in November. Earlier this year, Ola also rebranded its quick commerce business as Ola Dash.With competition rising, trouble soon started to plague Blinkit. The company has reportedly laid off employees, shuttered dark stores, and delayed some vendor in the payments in the past weeks. By merging Blinkit with the company, Zomato has underlined its commitment to the quick commerce space. In fact, its investment in Blinkit last year also meant Zomato would be bringing groceries back on to the platform, after discontinuing it in 2020.In its third quarter earnings report, Zomato said that it is aggressively growing quick commerce segment and will invest $400 million over next two years in the category.""Blinkit is the closest to how we all know the quick commerce business today. Blinkit pioneered 10-minute grocery delivery in India post our $100 million investment in August 2021,"" it noted.It said that Blinkit scaled rapidly to $450 million annual run rate gross merchandise value (GMV) (January 2022 annualised) and now operates with over 400 dark stores across 20 cities in India.""100% of Blinkit's business now is in quick commerce format with a median delivery time of 12 minutes,"" it added.Deepinder Goyal, co-founder and CEO, Zomato had sold his personal stake in Blinkit to Tiger Global Management. in February.Share article on",https://www.vccircle.com//blinkit-to-merge-with-zomato-in-all-stock-deal,Merger/Acquisition,"Blinkit is set to merge with online food aggregator and delivery platform Zomato that will result in the quick commerce company losing its unicorn tag in less than a year and may dampen investor euphoria around the concept of 10-minute delivery service model.The transaction involves an all-stock deal that values Blinkit between $700 million and $800 million, two people familiar with the development told VCCircle.This means Blinkit (formerly Grofers) will lose its unicorn status it had achieved last year after getting over $120 million from Zomato and existing investor Tiger Global Management, Mint reported in August.""This loan will support the capital requirements of Grofers India Pvt Ltd in the near term and is in line with our stated intent of investing up to $400 million cash in quick commerce in India over the next two years,"" it added.Blinkit's short lived unicorn status is expected to not just raise questions about the cash guzzling quick commerce industry but may also cast a shadow over the startup ecosystem after a euphoric 2021 on the back of big-bang initial public offerings (IPO) of technology startups, large mergers and acquisitions (M&As), and an accelerated pace of creation of unicorns.","['Blinkit', 'Blinkit', 'VCCircle', 'Blinkit', 'Mint', 'Grofers India Pvt Ltd', 'Blinkit', 'IPO']","['between $700 million and $800 million', '$120 million', 'at least $1 billion', '$150 million', 'up to $400 million', '$100 million', '$60 million', '$400 million', '$100 million', '$450 million']"

It will be based on a phygital model – sourcing and assessment will be largely driven through technology which will be substantively backed by physical collection presence and infrastructure, the statement added. Northern Arc is backed by investors including LeapFrog, IIFL, Accion, Augusta Investments (known as Affirma Capital), Dvara Trust, Eight Roads and Japanese bank Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation (SMBC), which made its latest investment in September last year. Over the past more than a year, Northern Arc Capital has attracted debt financing from many global development finance institutions (DFIs) and impact investors including the US International Development Finance Corporation, Asian Development Bank, Calvert Impact Capital, and Dutch development Bank FMO.Share article on",https://www.vccircle.com//ipo-bound-northern-arc-to-buy-us-fund-dwm-owned-microlender-in-slump-sale,Merger/Acquisition,"Microfinance Ltd through a slump sale.“The acquisition will help us target the next billion in the rural finance business, by offering small ticket loans through a digital and data-led platform,” Northern Arc said in a statement without disclosing the financial details of the transaction.The transaction will involve the takeover of the microfinance portfolio of S.M.I.L.E., along with its network of nearly 150 branches catering to over 200,000 customers.We will leverage our existing capabilities across sector expertise, technology and data to build a high-quality business that focuses on customer centricity and best in-class processes…we intend to take advantage of their rural penetration and long-standing customer relationships to build and scale this business quickly,” said Kshama Fernandes, MD and CEO at Northern Arc.","['Microfinance Ltd', 'Northern Arc']",['more than 42 million']

Flipkart sells Cleartrip's Middle East business to Wego,21 February,"Online travel marketplace Wego, operated by Wego Pte Ltd, has signed a definitive agreement with the Flipkart Group to buy the Middle East business of its online travel portal Cleartrip, the companies said in a joint statement on Monday.As a part of the transaction, Wego will also buy Flyin.com--a company acquired by Cleartrip Cleartrip in 2018. Further, Flipkart and Wego have signed a technology co-operation agreement, the companies said.Last year in April, Flipkart had announced the proposal to acquire Cleartrip to diversify offerings. The boards of directors of both the companies have approved the transaction, financial details of which were not disclosed, and the deal is expected to close in the second half of 2022, according to the statement. Cleartrip had expanded organically into the Middle East region in 2010 and later acquired Riyadh-based Flyin.com, which led to the company starting operations in Saudi Arabia, the company said, adding that both Wego and Cleartrip have their regional headquarters located in Dubai Internet City.Cleartrip was founded in 2006 by Crighton, Hrush Bhatt and Matthew Spacie, who is not with the company anymore. It offers a platform for booking hotels, flights and trains. In 2016, it launched Cleartrip Local, a platform that offers curated activities and experiences.Wego, on its part, claims to operate the largest online travel marketplace in the Middle East and North Africa regions. The company offers a platform through mobile applications for travel search websites. The company uses technology to automate the process of searching, comparing and booking travel across airlines, hotel chains and online travel agencies. The company also has a headquarter in Singapore and counts Tiger Global Management, Crescent Point, Square Peg Capital, Middle East Venture Partners and the MBC Group as its backers. “The Middle East is set to be one of the most exciting growth stories of the next decade with the travel and technology sectors taking center stage and with the Wego group playing a very crucial role. This acquisition will significantly increase our scale and capabilities and will strengthen our ability to partner and collaborate across our region,” said Ross Veitch, Chief Executive Officer and Co-founder of Wego. Flipkart’s sale of Cleartrip’s Middle East operations comes at a time when the pandemic-led lockdowns and travel restrictions over the last two years have crippled demand for global travel.

India has still not opened its international borders to tourists and domestically, flights are still not operating at full capacity thanks to stringent restrictions put by local governments on movements of people. “Given our strategic priorities and focus on the Indian market, the acquisition of Cleartrip’s Middle East business by Wego provides continuity to its business, and we believe that they are the right partners to boost its next phase of growth,” said Ravi Iyer, Senior Vice President and Head - Corporate Development, Flipkart. Share article on",https://www.vccircle.com//wego-to-buy-cleartrip-s-middle-east-business-from-flipkart,Merger/Acquisition,"Online travel marketplace Wego, operated by Wego Pte Ltd, has signed a definitive agreement with the Flipkart Group to buy the Middle East business of its online travel portal Cleartrip, the companies said in a joint statement on Monday.As a part of the transaction, Wego will also buy Flyin.com--a company acquired by Cleartrip Cleartrip in 2018.Cleartrip had expanded organically into the Middle East region in 2010 and later acquired Riyadh-based Flyin.com, which led to the company starting operations in Saudi Arabia, the company said, adding that both Wego and Cleartrip have their regional headquarters located in Dubai Internet City.Cleartrip was founded in 2006 by Crighton, Hrush Bhatt and Matthew Spacie, who is not with the company anymore.","['Wego Pte Ltd', 'the Flipkart Group', 'Wego', 'Flyin.com', 'Cleartrip Cleartrip', 'Flyin.com', 'Crighton']",[]

The brand has been endorsed by several Indian film industry actors. BBlunt has products like hair colors, shampoos, dry shampoos, conditioners, styling products, serums and temporary hair colors. BBlunt said that the hair color and hairstyling category market is estimated to be worth Rs 6,000 crore. Honasa Consumer said that it can strengthen BBlunt’s D2C (direct-to-customer) and e-commerce businesses.“Honasa is a strong player in the direct-to-consumer (and) e-commerce space and they see great potential in the brand and the salon heritage that we have. We, the team, are very excited to see what the future holds in this exciting new chapter for the brand,” said Adhuna Bhabani, Founder and Director, BBlunt. Honasa Consumer, which recently joined the coveted unicorn club (private companies with over $1 billion valuation), has been on an acquisition spree as the company is eyeing to build a ‘house of brands,’ a strategy that is fast gaining traction of late. In December, Honasa Consumer had bought content platform Momspresso in a bid to expand its consumer engagement strategies. The company, which counts Sequoia Capital among its backers, had also recently reported a net profit of Rs 24.6 crore for FY21 against a net loss of Rs 5.9 crore in 2019-20 (FY20), VCCircle had reported.“Being a house of brands, Honasa Consumer Pvt Ltd has attained expertise in building millennial brands with a digital-first approach. We will utilize our expertise and proficiency in digital marketing to accelerate the growth and scale of BBlunt.

ShareChat acquires rival MX Taka Tak,10 February,"Homegrown social media platform ShareChat — the parent company of short-video platform Moj — announced a “strategic merger” with Times Internet-owned MX Taka Tak today. The deal, which was first reported by Mint in October 2021, will see Sharechat controlling both the platforms — Moj and Taka Tak. The company said that the combined platform will have 100 million creators and 300 million monthly active users (MAUs).Following the transaction, MX Media Co. Ltd and its shareholders will become strategic shareholders of ShareChata. The company said that MX Taka Tak will continue to function as a separate platform “for now” but the creator base, content supply and recommendation algorithms of the two platforms will be integrated. Taka Tak will also gain access to camera technology from US-based Snapchat, which is an investor in ShareChat.“With this development, we aim to build the largest original content platform on Moj along with the largest community of users across India,” said Ankush Sachdeva, chief executive and co-founder of ShareChat and Moj, said, in a statement. Neither company has confirmed the deal value at this time, but a Reuters report earlier said that the deal value could be around $700 million.The acquisition is a sign of consolidation in India’s short-video market. Platforms like Moj, MX Taka Tak, ad-tech giant InMobi’s Roposo, and more, had all gained from the government’s ban on Chinese TikTok two years ago. Since then, platforms like Roposo have pivoted to Live Video.ShareChat’s parent firm, Mohalla Tech, employs over 2000 people at the moment, while MX Taka Tak has nearly 150. Employees from Taka Tak are also going to join ShareChat, and the acquisition will help bolster its position in the short-video market here. An October 2021 report from Bain and Company, said that Moj already led India’s short video market, 85% of which is accounted for by the top five players. Taka Tak, unicorn DailyHunt-owned Josh, Roposo and Chinese Zili took the next four spots, respectively.The report also noted that India’s online video user base had scaled to 350 million, growing at double the rate of countries like China and Indonesia.Mohalla Tech has raised over $1 billion till date, according to business information platform Crunchbase. The company had raised $266 million as part of its Series G funding round in December 2021, at a valuation of $3.7 billion. At the time, two people aware of developments told Mint that the company is looking to raise $500 million as part of this round, which will raise its valuation to around $5 billion.Share article on",https://www.vccircle.com//india-s-sharechat-buys-rival-mx-s-short-video-app-in-700-mln-deal-sources-say,Merger/Acquisition,"The company said that MX Taka Tak will continue to function as a separate platform “for now” but the creator base, content supply and recommendation algorithms of the two platforms will be integrated.Taka Tak will also gain access to camera technology from US-based Snapchat, which is an investor in ShareChat.“With this development, we aim to build the largest original content platform on Moj along with the largest community of users across India,” said Ankush Sachdeva, chief executive and co-founder of ShareChat and Moj, said, in a statement.",['Snapchat'],"['around $700 million', 'over $1 billion', '$266 million', '$3.7 billion', '$500 million', 'around $5 billion']"

Deal volume in 2021 clocks 60% spike; M&A activity to remain buoyant: PwC India,10 February,"India Inc has logged a record-high deal activity and also surpassed pre-Covid wave in the current 2021 financial year with 2,064 transactions worth $114.9 billion, a jump of 40% in value and 60% in deal volume, as compared to 2020, shows a PwC India’s new report. The report titled ‘PwC India’s Deals in India: Annual review and outlook for 2022’ revealed that several key contributors, including private equity availability, abundant cash reserves, foreign direct investment and lower interest rates, pushed the activity growth in 2021.  It further showed that PE deal activity contributed a significant portion of the value and volume, accounting value and volume for 57% and 61% respectively. PE transaction value also recorded an all-time high of $66.1 billion, with 1,258 deals, a 32% rise in volume and a 50% in value from 2020. Besides, mergers and acquisitions (M&A) drove the activity balance, accounting for 43% and 39%, respectively.   “It is clear that despite headwinds from the pandemic and other uncertainties, CEOs in India are significantly optimistic about the prospects for a stronger economy in the coming year. We, therefore, expect the momentum of deal activity to continue in 2022. On the corporate side, we expect the strategic shift to digital, innovative and new disruptive business models to continue to drive M&A decision-making,” said Dinesh Arora, Partner and Leader – Deals, PwC India, said,    The findings also showed that exits by private equity firms also increased significantly, accounting for roughly six times the value of exits in 2020.  Strategic sales accounted for 36% of the exit value in 2021. The exits, according to the report, show that long-term investors are looking for high valuations and are taking advantage of the exit momentum.   M&A activity in 2021 was more than double the volume and 28% higher in value as compared to 2020. M&A megadeals in sectors such as renewables, infrastructure and education reflect the continued interest in consolidation.    Large deals in the renewable energy sector, such as Adani Green Energy's $3.5 billion acquisition of SB Energy India and Reliance New Energy Solar's $771 million acquisition of REC Solar Holdings, fueled M&A activity. With Wipro's $1.5 billion acquisition of Capco and Byju's $600 million and $500 million acquisitions of Great Learning and Epic, IT was the next large segment.   Domestic M&A was boosted in 2021 by economic confidence and sufficient capital, with corporations disposing non-core assets to consolidate massive corporate structures and then using the cash to buy assets, according to the report.   The technology sector continued to dominate Indian private equity investment. In 2021, there were 823 agreements for $40 billion, which is nearly five times the amount seen in 2020. The rise was mostly due to larger deal sizes, with five multibillion-dollar deals totaling $12.1 billion and 78 mid-sized deals totaling $19.4 billion, compared to only 19 mid-sized deals in 2020.   The conditions that contributed to 2021's record M&A market will continue to influence deal-making in 2022.  PE deals have had a particularly strong run recently, and they are on track to increase their proportion of M&A, decisions making will be driven by the strategic move to digital, and new disruptive business models on the corporate side.  CEOs will likely focus on divestitures as they restructure their portfolios for longer-term development and profitability, given market conditions that demand a more value creation mindset across global boardrooms.   The startup ecosystem is likely to continue strong in 2022, fueled by PE activity, with more new-age companies becoming unicorns. Many unicorns will become serial acquirers, causing a wave of consolidation among new-age businesses. In 2022, PE firms are projected to participate in more takeover and control transactions.  Although the IPO market frenzy is predicted to slow off both in terms of values and interest as post-listing blues hit the market, PE is expected to gamble on early-stage innovative companies, the report stated.   Share article on",https://www.vccircle.com//deal-volume-in-2021-clocks-60-spike-m-a-activity-to-remain-buoyant-pwc-india,Merger/Acquisition,"India Inc has logged a record-high deal activity and also surpassed pre-Covid wave in the current 2021 financial year with 2,064 transactions worth $114.9 billion, a jump of 40% in value and 60% in deal volume, as compared to 2020, shows a PwC India’s new report.On the corporate side, we expect the strategic shift to digital, innovative and new disruptive business models to continue to drive M&A decision-making,” said Dinesh Arora, Partner and Leader – Deals, PwC India, said,    The findings also showed that exits by private equity firms also increased significantly, accounting for roughly six times the value of exits in 2020.",['India Inc'],"['$114.9 billion', '$66.1 billion', '$3.5 billion', '$771 million', '$1.5 billion', '$600 million and $500 million', '$40 billion', 'five multibillion-dollar', '$12.1 billion', '$19.4 billion']"

India VC investment at over $10 bn in Q4: KPMG report,20 January,"Venture capital investments in India fell sequentially to $10.36 billion in October-December last year after reaching a record quarterly high of $15.39 billion in July-September, according to a KPMG Venture Pulse report.However, venture capital investment in the October-December period was India's second-best quarter ever, the report said.The increase in interest from venture capital investors in India is due to a developing economy, stable government policies, and a burgeoning middle class. Besides, shifting policy orientations in China are likely to have contributed to increased investment in India, particularly in industries that are not a priority for the Chinese government.The report explained that while certain industries in China have seen venture capital investment dry up in recent quarters owing to regulatory changes, other industries have continued to draw attention. Those industries that continue to remain in favour include advanced manufacturing, electric vehicle manufacture, renewable energy, green technology, healthcare, and biotech, it said.In terms of sectors, fintech, health-tech, business-to-business (B2B) services, and direct-to-consumer (D2C) platforms, remained a highly strong area of venture capital investment in India during the fourth quarter of 2021.Globally, too, venture capital investment totalled $171 billion, slightly less than the previous peak of $180 billion in the July-September quarter, it said.The report also said exit activity was brisk in Asia in 2021, with India's initial public offerings (IPOs) of online cosmetics business Nykaa and digital payments firm Paytm. Nykaa raised $722 million in its IPO in October, while Paytm raised $2.4 billion in November. The thriving stock market in India is likely to have fueled sustained interest in the venture capital business, as they have grown more confident that their investments in the nation will provide strong returns.  Amarjeet Singh, Partner, KPMG India, noted that over the last two years, India has stepped up in terms of its venture capital ecosystem and it's a very favourable market right now.""The stock markets have been booming. Investors have gained confidence about potential exits. All of these are driving VCs and LPs (Limited Partners) to put loads of money into India’s VC ecosystem -- and one well-positioned to continue as we head into 2022,” added Singh.India also witnessed 14 new unicorns born alone in the October-December quarter.""The number of new unicorns in India demonstrates the rising diversity of India's startup ecosystem and the maturity of startups in a variety of industries,"" the report noted.Venture capital investment is expected to be robust until 2022, with less developed markets like Africa and the Middle East expected to attract greater interest from investors. Fintech, along with B2B services, healthtech, cybersecurity, and AI solutions across industries, will likely remain one of the hottest investment areas.  Globally, environment social and governance (ESG)-aligned firms and venture capital investors are increasingly prioritising or targeting a larger variety of ESG aspects, and such investments are likely to rise as a result, the report stated.Share article on",https://www.vccircle.com//india-vc-investment-at-over-10-bn-in-q4-kpmg-report,Merger/Acquisition,"Venture capital investments in India fell sequentially to $10.36 billion in October-December last year after reaching a record quarterly high of $15.39 billion in July-September, according to a KPMG Venture Pulse report.However, venture capital investment in the October-December period was India's second-best quarter ever, the report said.The increase in interest from venture capital investors in India is due to a developing economy, stable government policies, and a burgeoning middle class.Those industries that continue to remain in favour include advanced manufacturing, electric vehicle manufacture, renewable energy, green technology, healthcare, and biotech, it said.In terms of sectors, fintech, health-tech, business-to-business (B2B) services, and direct-to-consumer (D2C) platforms, remained a highly strong area of venture capital investment in India during the fourth quarter of 2021.Globally, too, venture capital investment totalled $171 billion, slightly less than the previous peak of $180 billion in the July-September quarter, it said.The report also said exit activity was brisk in Asia in 2021, with India's initial public offerings (IPOs) of online cosmetics business Nykaa and digital payments firm Paytm.","['Venture', 'KPMG Venture Pulse', 'healthcare', 'Nykaa']","['$10.36 billion', '$15.39 billion', '$171 billion', '$180 billion', '$722 million', '$2.4 billion']"

50 startups set to be unicorns; tally set to top 100 in 2022: Report,17 January,"Indian startups witnessed a strong year in 2021, and the momentum is set to continue in 2022, with more than 50 startups in line to turn unicorn - or startups valued at more than $1 billion, taking the total tally well beyond 100 in the current year, a PwC India Report said on Monday.   While fintechs raised nearly four times as much capital in CY21 as they did in CY20, edtech startups came in second, garnering about $3.9 billion in CY21, an increase of 86% over the $2.2 billion raised in CY20. Edtech firms that had previously received funding from investors in early CY20 were able to considerably increase their active user base and engagement rates, resulting in a concentrated pool of startups seeking more funding.   Around 85% of funding goes to growth and late-stage deals. In CY21, deals at all levels of fundraising grew, but growth and late-stage deals stood out, with a 50% increase in deal count and more than 2x increase in average deal ticket size. As the number of deals closed rises, so does the number of Indian startups, and larger ticket sizes frequently contribute to a quick rise in company valuations.   “We can see that the base of the companies in the growth stage and late-stage deals have improved significantly in CY21, depicting a stronger base of companies having the potential to reach unicorn status. With market sentiments favourably inclined towards startups, and the large base of scaled startup companies at the end of CY21, we expect the startups unicorn tally to go well beyond 100 by the end of 2022,” said Amit Nawka, Partner – Deals and Startups Leader, PwC India.  The year also witnessed 250 M&A deals, a significant increase from previous years. New business models with M&A at the core of their business plans, large startups acquiring capabilities and market presence, and large corporates making significant stakes – notably the Tata and Reliance Groups – all fueled M&A in the startup ecosystem. Thrasio-style roll-up ecommerce firms accounted for four of the top ten startup acquirers in 2021 - Mensa Brands, Global Bees, Curefoods, and 10club.  Share article on",https://www.vccircle.com//50-startups-set-to-be-unicorns-tally-set-to-top-100-in-2022-report,Merger/Acquisition,"Indian startups witnessed a strong year in 2021, and the momentum is set to continue in 2022, with more than 50 startups in line to turn unicorn - or startups valued at more than $1 billion, taking the total tally well beyond 100 in the current year, a PwC India Report said on Monday.With market sentiments favourably inclined towards startups, and the large base of scaled startup companies at the end of CY21, we expect the startups unicorn tally to go well beyond 100 by the end of 2022,” said Amit Nawka, Partner – Deals and Startups Leader, PwC India.",['PwC India Report'],"['more than $1 billion', 'about $3.9 billion', '$2.2 billion']"

India's Future Retail asks court to declare arbitration with Amazon illegal,03 January,"India's Future Retail has asked a New Delhi court to declare ongoing arbitration proceedings with Amazon.com illegal, saying the country's antitrust agency had suspended a 2019 deal which Amazon used to assert its rights over Future.Amazon successfully used the terms of its toehold $200 million investment in debt-laden Future to block the Indian retailer's attempt to sell retail assets to a rival, alleging breach of certain contracts.But the Indian antitrust body, the Competition Commission of India, in December suspended the 2019 deal saying Amazon suppressed information while seeking approvals.The long-running dispute is being heard by a Singapore arbitration panel, but both sides have been fighting parallel cases in Indian courts to enforce or overrule certain decisions taken by the arbitrator.In the latest Future Retail filing in New Delhi, the company argues that since the 2019 deal no longer has antitrust approval, it has ""no legal existence"" in India and Amazon can no longer assert any of its rights.The ""continuation of the entire arbitration proceedings is a perpetuation of illegality,"" Future said in its filing dated Dec. 31.The case will likely be heard by judges this week.Future and Amazon did not respond to a request for comment.The filing also showed that Future's appeal to the Delhi High Court comes after the Singapore arbitration panel did not agree to its immediate demands to terminate the proceedings, saying arguments would continue this month.Amazon has long argued that Future violated the terms of its 2019 deal in deciding to sell retail assets to Reliance, and the U.S. company's position has so far been backed by the Singapore arbitrator and Indian courts. Future denies any wrongdoing.But people familiar with the case say the antitrust suspension could make it easier for Future to push through its attempts to sell retail assets to Reliance and weaken Amazon's legal position.The dispute over Future Retail, which has more than 1,500 supermarket and other outlets, is the most hostile flashpoint between Jeff Bezos' Amazon and Reliance, run by India's richest man Mukesh Ambani, as they try to gain the upper hand in winning retail consumers.Share article on",https://www.vccircle.com//india-s-future-retail-asks-court-to-declare-arbitration-with-amazon-illegal,Merger/Acquisition,"India's Future Retail has asked a New Delhi court to declare ongoing arbitration proceedings with Amazon.com illegal, saying the country's antitrust agency had suspended a 2019 deal which Amazon used to assert its rights over Future.Amazon successfully used the terms of its toehold $200 million investment in debt-laden Future to block the Indian retailer's attempt to sell retail assets to a rival, alleging breach of certain contracts.But the Indian antitrust body, the Competition Commission of India, in December suspended the 2019 deal saying Amazon suppressed information while seeking approvals.The long-running dispute is being heard by a Singapore arbitration panel, but both sides have been fighting parallel cases in Indian courts to enforce or overrule certain decisions taken by the arbitrator.In the latest Future Retail filing in New Delhi, the company argues that since the 2019 deal no longer has antitrust approval, it has ""no legal existence"" in India and Amazon can no longer assert any of its rights.The ""continuation of the entire arbitration proceedings is a perpetuation of illegality,"" Future said in its filing dated Dec. 31.The case will likely be heard by judges this week.Future and Amazon did not respond to a request for comment.The filing also showed that Future's appeal to the Delhi High Court comes after the Singapore arbitration panel did not agree to its immediate demands to terminate the proceedings, saying arguments would continue this month.Amazon has long argued that Future violated the terms of its 2019 deal in deciding to sell retail assets to Reliance, and the U.S. company's position has so far been backed by the Singapore arbitrator and Indian courts.Future denies any wrongdoing.But people familiar with the case say the antitrust suspension could make it easier for Future to push through its attempts to sell retail assets to Reliance and weaken Amazon's legal position.The dispute over Future Retail, which has more than 1,500 supermarket and other outlets, is the most hostile flashpoint between Jeff Bezos' Amazon and Reliance, run by India's richest man Mukesh Ambani, as they try to gain the upper hand in winning retail consumers.Share article on","['Future Retail', 'Amazon.com', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'the Competition Commission', 'Amazon', 'Future Retail', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'Future', 'the Delhi High Court', 'Amazon', 'Future', 'Reliance', 'Reliance', 'Amazon', 'Future Retail', 'Amazon', 'Reliance']",['$200 million']
"Global M&A volumes hit record high in 2021, breach $5 trillion for first time",31 December,"Global dealmaking is set to maintain its scorching pace next year, after a historic year for merger and acquisition (M&A) activity that was fueled largely by easy availability of cheap financing and booming stock markets. Global M&A volumes topped $5 trillion for the first time ever, comfortably eclipsing the previous record of $4.55 trillion set in 2007, Dealogic data showed. The overall value of M&A stood at $5.8 trillion in 2021, up 64% from a year earlier, according to Refinitiv. Flush with cash and encouraged by soaring stock market valuations, large buyout funds, corporates and financiers struck 62,193 deals in 2021, up 24% from the year-earlier period, as all-time records tumbled during each month of the year. Investment bankers said they are expecting the dealmaking frenzy to continue well into next year, despite looming interest rate hikes. Higher interest rates increase borrowing costs, which may slow down M&A activity. However, deal advisers still expect a flurry of large mergers in 2022. Accommodative monetary policies from the U.S. Federal Reserve fueled a stock market rally and gave company executives access to cheap financing, which in turn emboldened them to go after large targets. The United States led the way for M&A, accounting for nearly half of global volumes - the value of M&A nearly doubled to $2.5 trillion in 2021, despite a tougher antitrust environment under the Biden administration.

Buyouts backed by private-equity firms more than doubled this year to cross the $1 trillion mark for the first time ever, according to Refinitiv data. Despite a slowdown in activity in the second half, dealmaking involving special purpose acquisition companies further boosted M&A volumes in 2021. SPAC deals accounted for about 10% of the global M&A volumes and added several billions of dollars to the overall tally.Share article on",https://www.vccircle.com//global-m-a-volumes-hit-record-high-in-2021-breach-5-trillion-for-first-time,Merger/Acquisition,"The United States led the way for M&A, accounting for nearly half of global volumes - the value of M&A nearly doubled to $2.5 trillion in 2021, despite a tougher antitrust environment under the Biden administration.Graphic: Global M&A volumes since 2016 (in trillions of dollars), https://graphics.reuters.com/GLOBAL-DEALS/REVIEW/lbpgnjrzzvq/chart.png For an interactive graphic, click on this link: https://tmsnrt.rs/3pADSza The largest deals of the year included AT&T Inc's $43 billion deal to merge its media businesses with Discovery Inc; the $34 billion leveraged buyout of Medline Industries Inc; Canadian Pacific Railway's $31 billion takeover of Kansas City Southern ; and the breakups of American corporate behemoths General Electric Co and Johnson & Johnson .","[""AT&T Inc's"", 'Discovery Inc', 'Medline Industries Inc', ""Canadian Pacific Railway's"", 'General Electric Co', 'Johnson & Johnson']","['$5 trillion', '$4.55 trillion', '$5.8 trillion', '$2.5 trillion', 'trillions of dollars', '$43 billion', '$34 billion', '$31 billion', '$1 trillion', 'several billions of dollars']"

Amazon India approaches CCI to acquire Catamaran's stake in Cloudtail,22 December,"Just months after the mutual decision to end their joint venture, Amazon India has approached Indian antitrust body, Competition Commission of India (CCI) to seek its approval for acquiring Narayana Murthy-led Catamaran Ventures' stake in Prione, which operates Cloudtail.  If the approval for the deal comes through, Amazon will hold a 100% stake in Prione.  “Prione Business Services Pvt. Ltd., the joint venture between Catamaran and Amazon, will be acquired by Amazon subject to requisite regulatory approvals. On August 09, 2021, the Partners had announced their decision to not continue the JV beyond the end of its current term of May 2022.  Amazon will acquire Catamaran’s shareholding in Prione in compliance with applicable laws including all assets and liabilities,” Amazon India and Catamaran said in a joint statement on Wednesday.   “The businesses of the Joint Venture shall continue under the leadership of the current management and on receipt of regulatory approvals, the board of Prione & Cloudtail will take steps to complete the transaction in compliance with applicable laws,” said the two companies.   Prione-owned Cloudtail is one of the largest sellers on Amazon India’s marketplace.  India prohibits foreign direct investment (FDI) in inventory-based models for e-commerce, and permits companies such as Amazon India and Flipkart to work only as marketplaces that allow businesses listed on their platforms to sell goods. The department of industrial policy and promotion of the ministry of commerce and industry had issued Press Note No. 2 on 26 December 2018, disallowing participation of marketplaces in seller activities through any group companies. To abide by the law, in 2019, Catamaran Ventures eventually increased its stake in Cloudtail’s parent to 76% from 51% earlier, with Amazon reducing its stake to 24% from 49% earlier. “Prione and Cloudtail business will continue till receipt of regulatory approvals. On receipt of regulatory approvals, the board of Prione and Cloudtail will take steps to ensure compliance with applicable laws to enable Amazon to complete the acquisition of Catamaran’s shares in Prione […] We will ensure that the transaction is in compliance with applicable laws,” said an Amazon India spokesperson replying to Mint’s queries on the matter.  Prione, which was founded in 2014, has enabled more than 300,000 sellers and entrepreneurs to go online and enabled 4 million merchants with digital payment capabilities, according to the last official numbers released by Amazon India in August this year.  While announcing the end to their seven-year long partnership both companies had said that Cloudtail India Pvt. Ltd. will shut operations in May 2022. Last week, CCI had rejected Amazon's 2019 deal with Future to remain in abeyance, citing US e-commerce major's failure to notify certain commercial arrangements as part of 2019 deal. The markets watchdog also imposed ₹200 crore penalty on Amazon.Share article on",https://www.vccircle.com//amazon-india-approaches-cci-to-acquire-catamaran-s-stake-in-cloudtail,Merger/Acquisition,"“The businesses of the Joint Venture shall continue under the leadership of the current management and on receipt of regulatory approvals, the board of Prione & Cloudtail will take steps to complete the transaction in compliance with applicable laws,” said the two companies.On receipt of regulatory approvals, the board of Prione and Cloudtail will take steps to ensure compliance with applicable laws to enable Amazon to complete the acquisition of Catamaran’s shares in Prione […] We will ensure that the transaction is in compliance with applicable laws,” said an Amazon India spokesperson replying to Mint’s queries on the matter.","['Prione & Cloudtail', 'Prione', 'Cloudtail', 'Amazon', 'Catamaran', 'Mint']",['200']

Masai School buys data analytics institute Prepleaf,21 December,"Masai School, which offers courses in technology, has acquired data analytics and end-to-end placement preparation company Prepleaf for $1 million, the company said in a statement on Tuesday.  The acquisition will enable Masai to offer courses in data and business analytics, alongside web development, user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) Desing courses, the company said. Prepleaf, founded in 2017 by IIT Kanpur alumni Ankit Agrawal, Amit Saharan and Aman Singhal, offers courses in data analytics typically having a duration of five months.   Prepleaf was initially launched as a test preparation platform based on a survey conducted among the alumni of IIT Kanpur, which analysed test patterns of companies who visited the campus for placements. The team, on the basis of the analysis, was able to build an initial product for Prepleaf. In January 2021, the company introduced a training curriculum with its course. Currently, Prepleaf claims to have around 250 students enrolled in the Data Analytics test preparation courses. Preleaf offers courses through an income share agreement, where students pay fees only if they get packaged of more than Rs 5 lakh per annum. The company also claims that its clients get annual packages of around Rs 7.5 lakh per annum on an average.  “We are certainly thrilled to be part of the Masai family and make this ambition a reality by transforming the way skill-based education is delivered today and creating a world-class talent pool from India,” said Ankit Agrawal, Co-founder, Chief Executive Officer, Prepleaf.   Earlier this year, Masai School had also bought Bengaluru-based design institute Design Shift Academy for an undisclosed amount, VCCircle had reported, with which, the alternative education startup had introduced new learning programmes on UI & UX design and product management.      Masai School, operated by Nolan Edutech Pvt Ltd, was founded in 2019 by Prateek Shukla, Yogesh Bhat, and Nrupul Dev, and the firm also has an income-sharing agreement for the courses that it offers. The firm had raised $5 million in a Series A funding round, earlier this year from Omidyar Network India, along with Unitus Ventures, India Quotient, and AngelList India. In 2020, the company had raised $2.5 million in its pre-Series A funding round from Unitus Ventures, India Quotient and AngelList India. Share article on",https://www.vccircle.com//masai-school-buys-data-analytics-institute-prepleaf,Merger/Acquisition,"Masai School, which offers courses in technology, has acquired data analytics and end-to-end placement preparation company Prepleaf for $1 million, the company said in a statement on Tuesday.“We are certainly thrilled to be part of the Masai family and make this ambition a reality by transforming the way skill-based education is delivered today and creating a world-class talent pool from India,” said Ankit Agrawal, Co-founder, Chief Executive Officer, Prepleaf.",['Masai School'],"['$1 million', '$5 million', '$2.5 million']"

Indian companies more acquisitive post covid: Bain & Co,21 December,"The business disruption caused by the covid-19 pandemic is encouraging Indian companies to transform their businesses through M&A and divestitures, as seen by the India M&A activity nearing an all-time high, driven in particular by first-time buyers, according to a report by consulting firm Bain & Co. “Companies are using M&A more than ever before to transform their businesses for a post-Covid world,” said the report titled India M&A: Acquiring to Transform authored by Karan Singh and Vikram Chandrashekhar, partners at Bain & Co. “More companies are doing more deals than ever before. M&A volume is near its highest level ever (considering deals >$75 million), and M&A deals are more broad-based than ever—with more midsized deals, rather than the $5 billion plus megadeals that drove activity in 2017–2019,” the report added. Bain outlined seven major themes that have driven the acquisition activity in covid times and which it expects to continue going into 2022. Prime among these is the democratization of M&A, with the past two years having seen more first-time buyers than ever with the first-time buyers accounting for more than 80% of deals in the past two years (2020–2021), up from less than 70% in 2017–2019. More companies doing more deals also means average deal size is now smaller, with fewer $5 billion plus megadeals and more deals in the $500 million–$1 billion range. Another major theme is that more M&A is now increasingly focused on transformation than scale, the report said. “Scope deals—acquisitions outside a company’s core business—are steadily growing share of deal volumes. Scope and capability deals now account for 4 out of 10 transactions, often addressing disruptive themes, such as digital or renewables,” Bain & Co said. Acquisitions by leading digital companies have also increased significantly, adding to M&A deals. “In the past year, M&A by digital insurgents has hit never-seen-before highs—insurgents are buying to build scale rapidly, enter new geographies, enter new lines of business, and deliver a full omni-channel experience to customers. For example, edtech insurgent BYJU’s has been on a $2B+ acquisition spree, with 11+ acquisitions—of which approximately $1B went towards acquiring Aakash Educational Services, an offline test prep company, to build an omnichannel learning offering for their test-prep vertical. Oyo has been making several acquisitions globally to enter new geographies,” the report said. Insurgents also realise that their stock is valuable currency, with two-thirds of deals done by insurgents are stock-plus-cash transactions, it added.Other major themes driving M&A include increasing dollars being allocated for India investments by private equity firms, reshaping of portfolios by large conglomerates through divestitures and acquisitions and rising global interest in the Indian renewable energy sector and robust cross border M&A. Share article on",https://www.vccircle.com//india-companies-more-acquisitive-post-covid-bain-co,Merger/Acquisition,"The business disruption caused by the covid-19 pandemic is encouraging Indian companies to transform their businesses through M&A and divestitures, as seen by the India M&A activity nearing an all-time high, driven in particular by first-time buyers, according to a report by consulting firm Bain & Co. “Companies are using M&A more than ever before to transform their businesses for a post-Covid world,” said the report titled India M&A: Acquiring to Transform authored by Karan Singh and Vikram Chandrashekhar, partners at Bain & Co. “More companies are doing more deals than ever before.Insurgents also realise that their stock is valuable currency, with two-thirds of deals done by insurgents are stock-plus-cash transactions, it added.Other major themes driving M&A include increasing dollars being allocated for India investments by private equity firms, reshaping of portfolios by large conglomerates through divestitures and acquisitions and rising global interest in the Indian renewable energy sector and robust cross border M&A.","['Bain & Co.', 'Bain & Co.']","['$75 million', '$5 billion', 'fewer $5 billion', '2B+', 'approximately $1B']"

A large chunk - 68% - of M&A transactions, IT, startups, and e-commerce sectors dominated the segment, with 80% of values for the current month, and an aggregate value of $350 million.“The absence of big-ticket transactions, partly owing to non-disclosure of deal values in the majority of M&A transactions (74% of deals) could be the reason for lower deal values. Deal activity continued to be primarily in the technology sector, including startups and e-commerce sectors. Better health of the banking system and supportive policy measures saw active deal-making in the financial sector, whereas resumption of economic activities and demand recovery benefitted consumer and retail sectors,” said Shanthi Vijetha, Partner at Grant Thornton Bharat.Similar to the M&A deal trend, private equity (PE) investments saw a 41% increase in volume but a 26% drop in deal value, with $3.1 billion compared to $4.2 billion in the same month last year. The month witnessed eight high-value investments of above $100 million, constituting 64% of total PE values for the month compared to two deals valued at over $ 1 billion, and seven deals valued at over $100 million in November 2020.     In addition, for the second month in a row, Thrasio-style start-ups such as Globalbees and 10club, Evenflow brands, and UpScalio completed M&A transactions. During the month, companies such as Zomato, 10club, GlobalBees, Betterplace Safety Solutions, Easemytrip, and eBikeGo completed numerous deals in the start-up and IT sectors.   November saw the emergence of six new unicorns – Mensa Brands, Upstox; Curefit, Spinny, The Good Glamm Group and NoBroker. While the latest funding makes Mensa Brands Asia’s fastest firm to reach the unicorn status, the Good Glamm Group became India’s first direct to consumer beauty and personal care company to join the club; NoBroker at $1.01 billion valuation made the first proptech and real estate startup to achieve unicorn status. Interestingly, November also witnessed media, agriculture and IT sectors garnering high-value investments of over $100 million. Food delivery firm Zomato, which went public earlier this year, made a series of investments in startups as it looks for ways to inorganically expand its business.    Zomato invested $75 million in Shiprocket.

In total, Zomato is gaining a 6.4% stake in Curefit, creating another unicorn in the country.     Zomato’s investment in these companies comes at a time when it has decided to shut down its grocery and nutraceutical verticals, to focus on its core business around food deliveries.

Indian deep tech startups turning hot target for acquisitions,16 November,"Several Indian deep tech startups are getting acquired by larger global companies to gain access to niche technologies and quality talent, indicating a strong demand for startups focusing on disruptive technologies that can solve complex global problems.Earlier this year, KPIT Technologies Ltd announced the signing of a definitive agreement to acquire a controlling stake in Bengaluru-based PathPartner Technology for about Rs 191 crore.  The latter is a specialist in providing product engineering services to customers across automotive, consumer electronics, broadcast, medical and IoT domains. It has an offshore research facility in California as well as presence in Germany and Japan.  In May, General Atlantic-owned KFin Technologies, a Hyderabad-based registry services firm, acquired a 17% stake in insurtech startup Artivatic.ai for an undisclosed sum. The acquirer also has an option to increase its stake to majority holding in Artivatic.ai. The investment is expected to help KFintech venture into insurance tech as it looks to diversify its offerings.  In September, US-based cloud video surveillance firm Eagle Eye Networks acquired Bengaluru-based AI startup Uncanny Vision to strengthen its capabilities in providing AI and analytics. Uncanny Vision’s deep learning algorithms enable recognition, identification, and prediction to improve business operations, customer service, and site safety. A month later, Accenture entered into an agreement to acquire BRIDGEi2i, an AI and analytics firm based in Bengaluru. The acquisition is expected to add about 800 tech professionals to Accenture’s Applied Intelligence practice, helping in strengthening its global capabilities in data science, ML, and AI-based insights.    Deep tech startups refer to those whose business model is based on high tech innovation in engineering or significant scientific advances. According to Nasscom, India had about 2,100 deep tech startups as of 2020.To be sure, Nasscom launched the second edition of its deep tech mentoring program called Deep Tech Club (DTC) 2.0 earlier this year. The initiative aims to nurture and promote Indian deep tech startups, and discover disruptive startups enabled by artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), augmented reality, virtual reality, internet of things (IoT), robotics, blockchain, natural language processing (NLP), and similar technologies.Deep tech companies are getting acquired for two possible reasons, according to industry experts and investors. “One is, large companies may want to fill certain technology gaps in their portfolio. The other reason is, a very good tech team of a startup may be working on the wrong problem. So, that startup might get aqui-hired to bolster their tech talent,” said Vinay Bansal, founder and CEO, Inflection Point Ventures, an angel investment firm.  Huddle, an accelerator and fund for early-stage ventures concurs with the view. “Many large companies look to acquire niche deep tech startups to gain access to a technology stack that they may not be able to build on their own as many of them may not be digital natives. Often, such acquisitions also offer quality talent at an affordable cost,” said Sanil Sachar, founding partner at Huddle.Kishor Patil, CEO of KPIT Technologies, for instance, says his company acquired PathPartner because it realised that the latter’s ""competence in the operating system software and low-level software and existing semiconductor partnerships for early access to platforms is key to delivering complex production programs. ""Together, we (KPIT Technologies and PathPartner) can offer differentiated offerings for new-age vehicle architectures and strengthen our software integration expertise,” he added.Likewise, one of Huddle's portfolio, NeuroPixel.AI, a deep-tech AI/ML startup, has already seen large companies showing interest in their solutions and potential partnerships, according to Ishaan Khosla, founding partner at Huddle.Interestingly, many of these startups get acquired in their early stages when majority of the fundamental suite of technologies are built. Khosla concluded, “Larger companies, that are not traditionally tech-first, look to acquire or partner with these deep-tech firms to access technology or talent.”Share article on",https://www.vccircle.com//indian-deep-tech-startups-turning-hot-target-for-acquisitions,Merger/Acquisition,"Several Indian deep tech startups are getting acquired by larger global companies to gain access to niche technologies and quality talent, indicating a strong demand for startups focusing on disruptive technologies that can solve complex global problems.Earlier this year, KPIT Technologies Ltd announced the signing of a definitive agreement to acquire a controlling stake in Bengaluru-based PathPartner Technology for about Rs 191 crore.""Together, we (KPIT Technologies and PathPartner) can offer differentiated offerings for new-age vehicle architectures and strengthen our software integration expertise,” he added.Likewise, one of Huddle's portfolio, NeuroPixel.AI, a deep-tech AI/ML startup, has already seen large companies showing interest in their solutions and potential partnerships, according to Ishaan Khosla, founding partner at Huddle.Interestingly, many of these startups get acquired in their early stages when majority of the fundamental suite of technologies are built.","['KPIT Technologies Ltd', 'PathPartner Technology', 'KPIT Technologies', 'PathPartner', 'Huddle', 'NeuroPixel', 'AI', 'AI/ML']",[]
India Inc records 221 deals worth $9.2 bn in October; M&A highest since 2015,15 November,"India Inc witnessed 221 deals worth $9.2 billion in October, an 11% increase compared to the previous month and double compared to the year ago period, according to the Grant Thornton Bharat Dealtracker released on Monday.   The number of mergers and acquisition (M&A) transactions in October 2021 stood at 61, as compared to 25 deals in October 2020, marking the highest monthly deal volume since September 2015.  October 2021’s total M&A transaction value stood at $3.3 billion across 61 deals, which is a multi-fold increase, both in terms of deal volumes and values compared with the deal activity in October 2020. The volumes were driven by domestic consolidation which constituted 79% of M&A volumes.  Over 75% of deals during the month did not report the deal value, thereby not presenting the whole picture of overall deal values for the month. However, the space saw a marquee deal - Tata’s acquisition of Air India from the Government of India for an aggregate value of $2.4 billion. This alone accounted for 73% of the total M&A value in October. While this will be the first privatisation since 2003-04, Air India will be the third airline brand under Tata’s table. Currently, it holds a majority stake in AirAsia India and Vistara, a joint venture with Singapore Airlines.“October has been encouraging, both in terms of deal volume and deal value, indicating the continuum in deal activities. While volumes recorded a 2x increase over October 2020, deal values saw a strong 24% increase. said Shanthi Vijetha, Partner, Grant Thornton Bharat said.The economy is being bolstered by the rapid improvement in high-frequency indicators such as the e-way bills, GST collection, power demand, rail freight and exports growth, etc. The current pace is likely to re-establish economic growth momentum,” he added.   Positive domestic business sentiment in addition to the ongoing rapid economic recovery across sectors and global economic recovery continues to aid the overall trend, the report stated. The month also saw private equity funds inflow in Indian companies amounting to $5.9 billion across 160 deals. While the investment volume almost doubled compared to a year ago period, the value saw an 11% decrease owing to reduced average deal size -- from $78 million in October 2020 to $37 million this October. Meanwhile, the month saw 14 high-value investments including Tata motors’ EV subsidiary’s fund raiser of $1 billion from TPG Rise Climate and Abu Dhabi’s ADQ. This is the first major fundraising by an Indian carmaker to push clean mobility.Driven by the aftermath of the pandemic, the hospitality and leisure, pharma and healthcare, e-commerce, retail and consumer sectors continue to remain active together, sealing 32% of the M&A deals in October. Further, media and entertainment, agriculture, banking, education, manufacturing, professional services and telecom sectors witnessed one deal each during the month.Interestingly, October witnessed a trend with only three sectors, including start-up, e-commerce, and education, witnessing high-value investments of over $100 million in a particular monthThe M&A volumes were primarily driven by start-up and IT sectors with over half the deals amounting to $391 million. The previous month welcomed 5 start-ups into the unicorn club - CoinSwitch, Acko General Insurance, Fasos, Licious, and Vedantu.The month also witnessed one of the largest Series A funding in the Indian start-up ecosystem with CredAvenue raising $90 million led by Sequoia Capital.Share article on",https://www.vccircle.com//india-inc-records-221-deals-worth-9-2-bn-in-october-m-a-highest-since-2015,Merger/Acquisition,"This is the first major fundraising by an Indian carmaker to push clean mobility.Driven by the aftermath of the pandemic, the hospitality and leisure, pharma and healthcare, e-commerce, retail and consumer sectors continue to remain active together, sealing 32% of the M&A deals in October.Further, media and entertainment, agriculture, banking, education, manufacturing, professional services and telecom sectors witnessed one deal each during the month.Interestingly, October witnessed a trend with only three sectors, including start-up, e-commerce, and education, witnessing high-value investments of over $100 million in a particular monthThe M&A volumes were primarily driven by start-up and IT sectors with over half the deals amounting to $391 million.",[],"['$9.2 billion', '$3.3 billion', '$2.4 billion', '$5.9 billion', '$78 million', '$37 million', '$1 billion', 'over $100 million', '$391 million', '$90 million']"

"Toshiba plans to split into three firms, rejects calls to go private",12 November,"Japan's Toshiba Corp outlined plans on Friday to split into three independent companies, seeking to appease activist shareholders calling for a radical overhaul after years of scandal.The move echoes a shift by fellow industrial conglomerate General Electric and will see Toshiba spin off core businesses - its energy and infrastructure divisions will be housed in one company while its device and storage businesses will form the backbone of another.The third will manage Toshiba's stake in flash-memory chip company Kioxia Holdings and other assets.The plan - borne of a five-month strategic review undertaken after a highly damaging corporate governance scandal - is partly aimed at encouraging activist shareholders to exit, sources with knowledge of the matter have said.The overhaul was announced after markets closed in Japan. The company's Frankfurt-listed shares fell 4% at the open on Friday highlighting investor disappointment with the plan. A break-up would run counter to calls by some shareholders for Toshiba to be taken private. Its strategic review committee said, however, that option had raised concerns internally about its impact on business and the retention of staff.Private equity firms had also conveyed concerns about completing a deal due to possible conflict with Japan's national security law and potential opposition from anti-trust regulators, it added.""After much discussion, we reached the conclusion that this strategic reorganisation was the best option,"" Chief Executive Satoshi Tsunakawa told a news conference.He added that Toshiba, which hopes to complete the overhaul in two years, would have chosen the option to split regardless of the presence of activist shareholders and that Japan's powerful trade ministry had not voiced any objections to the plan.A portfolio manager at an activist fund with shares in Toshiba said the plan was disappointing and unlikely to be voted through at the extraordinary general meeting (EGM) the Japanese company plans to hold by next March.""The activists have two options now - you can sell and go away and come back in two years time or you can buy more shares and fight this thing at the EGM. I'm going to go and think about what to do,"" said the portfolio manager who declined to be identified.RETURNS FOR SHAREHOLDERSAs part of the overhaul, Toshiba aims to return around 100 billion yen ($875 million) to shareholders over the next two financial years.It also said it intended to ""monetize"" its shares in Kioxia, returning the net proceeds in full to shareholders as soon as practicable. But it did not elaborate on whether that meant it was still keen on an IPO or would be considering other options.Other assets that will continue to be held by Toshiba include its stake in Toshiba Tec Corp, a maker of printing and retail information systems.Some Toshiba investors are not convinced that a break-up would create value, shareholder sources said ahead of a formal announcement of the plan.""It makes sense to split if the valuation of a highly competitive business is hindered by other businesses,"" said Fumio Matsumoto, chief strategist at Okasan Securities.""But if there isn't such a business, the break-up just creates three lacklustre midsize companies.""The once-storied 146-year old conglomerate has lurched from crisis to crisis since an accounting scandal in 2015. Two years later, it secured a $5.4 billion cash injection from 30-plus overseas investors that helped avoid a delisting but brought in activist shareholders including Elliott Management, Third Point and Farallon.Tension between Toshiba management and overseas shareholders has dominated headlines since then and in June, an explosive shareholder-commissioned investigation concluded that Toshiba colluded with Japan's trade ministry to block investors from gaining influence at last year's shareholders meeting.Earlier on Friday, Toshiba released a separately commissioned report that found executives including its former CEO had behaved unethically but not illegally.It concluded that Toshiba was overly dependent on the trade ministry, adding that problems were also caused by its ""excessive cautiousness towards foreign investment funds"" and ""its lack of willingness to develop a sound relationship with them.""Recovering from a slump due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Toshiba reported second-quarter operating profit roughly doubled to 30.4 billion yen.Share article on",https://www.vccircle.com//toshiba-plans-to-split-into-three-firms-rejects-calls-to-go-private,Merger/Acquisition,"Japan's Toshiba Corp outlined plans on Friday to split into three independent companies, seeking to appease activist shareholders calling for a radical overhaul after years of scandal.The move echoes a shift by fellow industrial conglomerate General Electric and will see Toshiba spin off core businesses - its energy and infrastructure divisions will be housed in one company while its device and storage businesses will form the backbone of another.The third will manage Toshiba's stake in flash-memory chip company Kioxia Holdings and other assets.The plan - borne of a five-month strategic review undertaken after a highly damaging corporate governance scandal - is partly aimed at encouraging activist shareholders to exit, sources with knowledge of the matter have said.The overhaul was announced after markets closed in Japan.""After much discussion, we reached the conclusion that this strategic reorganisation was the best option,"" Chief Executive Satoshi Tsunakawa told a news conference.He added that Toshiba, which hopes to complete the overhaul in two years, would have chosen the option to split regardless of the presence of activist shareholders and that Japan's powerful trade ministry had not voiced any objections to the plan.A portfolio manager at an activist fund with shares in Toshiba said the plan was disappointing and unlikely to be voted through at the extraordinary general meeting (EGM) the Japanese company plans to hold by next March.","['Toshiba Corp', 'General Electric', 'Toshiba', 'Toshiba', 'Kioxia Holdings', 'Toshiba', 'Toshiba']","['around 100 billion yen', '$875 million', '$5.4 billion', '30.4 billion yen']"

Zomato's investment turns Curefit to unicorn valued at $1.5 bn,10 November,"Food delivery and restaurant aggregation platform Zomato Ltd has acquired a 6.4% stake in Curefit Healthcare Ltd via twin deals, making it the 36th billion-dollar company, or unicorn, at $1.5 billion.  Zomato’s $100 million deal with Curefit is two-fold -- it sold sports facilities provider Fitso ( operated by Jojo Technologies) to Curefit for $50 million while also making a separate $50 million cash investment in the health and wellness business.  Zomato's decision to divest Fitso to Curefit comes just months after the foodtech major acquired the sports discovery platform for Rs 80 crore in January 2021. ""The divestment versus shutdown debate starts and ends with two questions – Can we sell the business to someone for whom it is core, and can they realise disproportionate returns from what we have built?

Prior to this, the startup had raised $120 million (Rs 832.6 crore) in its Series D round of funding via equity and debt in 2019.

"GE, an industrial conglomerate pioneer, to break up",09 November,"General Electric said on Tuesday it would split into three public companies as the storied U.S. industrial conglomerate seeks to simplify its business, pare down debt and breathe life into a battered share price.The split marks the end of the 129-year-old conglomerate that was once the most valuable U.S. corporation and a global symbol of American business power. GE shares jumped 7% in early trading, reaching a nearly 3-1/2 year high.GE has faced investor skepticism about its ability to turn a corner since the 2008 financial crisis, while struggling with rising debt. The company was also removed from the Dow Jones Industrial Average in 2018 following years of sliding valuation.GE's revenue for 2020 was $79.62 billion, a far cry from the over $180 billion in revenue it booked in 2008.In 2015, activist investor Nelson Peltz took a stake in GE and demanded changes at the company, including moving away from finance operations toward its industrial roots.The company's stock, however, continued to underperform and was seen to have prompted former Chief Executive Jeff Immelt's departure.Larry Culp, who became the company's first outsider CEO in 2018, was tasked with boosting cash flow and reducing debt. The company has since spun-off or sold several of its businesses in an effort to streamline its bewildering structure.Boston-based GE said the three businesses would focus on energy, healthcare and aviation. It will combine GE Renewable Energy, GE Power, and GE Digital and spin off the business in early 2024.GE will also separate the healthcare company, in which it expects to retain a stake of 19.9%, in early 2023.In an interview with Reuters, Chief Executive Officer Larry Culp said he did not expect the spin-off to face any regulatory or labor issues and that there was no investor pressure behind the spin-off decision.Following the split, it will become an aviation company, which will be helmed by Culp, who took over the conglomerate's reins in 2018. ""By creating three industry-leading, global public companies, each can benefit from greater focus, tailored capital allocation, and strategic flexibility to drive long-term growth and value,"" Culp said in a statement. The company expects to take a one-time charge of $2 billion related to separation and operational costs and tax costs of less than $500 million.Scott Strazik will head the combined Renewable Energy, Power and Digital business and Peter Arduini will lead GE Healthcare, the company said in a statement.The company also expects to reduce debt by more than $75 billion by the end of 2021, compared with 2018.Share article on",https://www.vccircle.com//ge-an-industrial-conglomerate-pioneer-to-break-up,Merger/Acquisition,"The company was also removed from the Dow Jones Industrial Average in 2018 following years of sliding valuation.GE's revenue for 2020 was $79.62 billion, a far cry from the over $180 billion in revenue it booked in 2008.In 2015, activist investor Nelson Peltz took a stake in GE and demanded changes at the company, including moving away from finance operations toward its industrial roots.The company's stock, however, continued to underperform and was seen to have prompted former Chief Executive Jeff Immelt's departure.Larry Culp, who became the company's first outsider CEO in 2018, was tasked with boosting cash flow and reducing debt.It will combine GE Renewable Energy, GE Power, and GE Digital and spin off the business in early 2024.GE will also separate the healthcare company, in which it expects to retain a stake of 19.9%, in early 2023.In an interview with Reuters, Chief Executive Officer Larry Culp said he did not expect the spin-off to face any regulatory or labor issues and that there was no investor pressure behind the spin-off decision.Following the split, it will become an aviation company, which will be helmed by Culp, who took over the conglomerate's reins in 2018.","['GE', 'GE', 'GE Renewable Energy', 'GE Power', 'GE Digital', 'Reuters', 'Culp']","['$79.62 billion', '$180 billion', '$2 billion', 'less than $500 million', 'more than $75 billion']"

US-based fintech major Stripe to acquire Recko in first Indian acquisition,20 October,"US-based fintech major Stripe Inc. on Wednesday said it has entered into a deal to acquire Bengaluru-based payment reconciliation software provider Recko for an undisclosed amount.This marks Stripe’s first acquisition in India, which has been actively hiring in the country across functions of product, engineering, policy. Stripe first stepped into India back in 2017, and continues to ramp its investment in local data architecture in India.  As part of the deal, Recko’s entire team will join Stripe’s remote engineering hub, helping to build and scale Stripe’s products globally. The acquisition is subject to customary closing conditions with Recko users continuing to use the company’s products directly, Stripe said in a statement on Wednesday evening.    The move is in line with Stripe expanding beyond its core offering of payment acceptance and looking at payment reconciliations apart from offering payment infrastructure to businesses. At present, Stripe offers products including payment links, billing and subscription software as well as online invoicing to its users.  Through the acquisition, Stripe will look to add another tool which will help businesses automate the collection of transaction data from their financial systems and non-Stripe payment processors. It will also help businesses match thousands of individual transactions with just a few clicks, saving finance teams manual reconciliation tasks while also helping them account for currency differences and chargebacks. “Payments reconciliation shouldn’t be a mild headache that balloons into a migraine as a company grows—it should be an easy, highly automated process. Stripe helps millions of businesses around the world streamline their revenue management—from subscriptions and invoicing to revenue recognition and bookkeeping. With Recko, we’ll automate their payments reconciliation, a critical input into their overall financial health,” said Will Gaybrick, chief product officer, Stripe. Payments processing startup Stripe is the highest valued venture-backed private company in the US and was recently valued at $95 billion in April this year, after closing its $600 million raise. It has till date raised more than $2.2 billion in venture funding.  “Joining Stripe is a perfect next chapter for Recko, and we can’t wait to help grow the GDP (gross domestic product) of the internet by removing the burden of reconciliation complexity. Internet businesses need new financial tools that can scale with their growth and automate the tasks required to produce an accurate picture of their financial health,” commented Saurya Prakash Sinha, chief executive officer and co-founder of Recko.  Four-year Recko provides artificial intelligence-powered reconciliation of digital transactions, and counts Deliveroo, Meesho, PharmEasy, as customers. The company has raised $7 million till date from the likes of Prime Venture Partners and Locus Ventures.  “Today's news is a testament to the quality of engineering and products being conceived and developed in the Indian startup ecosystem - and it's great to see these innovations going global. At Prime, we have been privileged to work with Saurya, Prashant, and the Recko team from the very beginning and wish them the very best,"" said Sanjay Swamy, managing partner, Prime Venture Partners.Share article on",https://www.vccircle.com//us-based-fintech-major-stripe-to-acquire-recko-in-first-indian-acquisition,Merger/Acquisition,"“Joining Stripe is a perfect next chapter for Recko, and we can’t wait to help grow the GDP (gross domestic product) of the internet by removing the burden of reconciliation complexity.“Today's news is a testament to the quality of engineering and products being conceived and developed in the Indian startup ecosystem - and it's great to see these innovations going global.",['Recko'],"['$95 billion', '$600 million', 'more than $2.2 billion', '$7 million']"

The company has also launched two new products, potty seats and dry sheets.   “We identified a nascent market and went after it - the way the daily run rate for the brand is going, we’re certain it wouldn’t take much time for us to be a key player in not just baby-proofing but the overall babycare category,” Utsav Agarwal, co-founder and CEO of Evenflow, said.  He added, “Over the next three years, we seek to acquire 80-100 such sellers.

Ride-hailing app Ola acquires geospatial-tech platform GeoSpoc,05 October,"ANI Technologies Ltd, the parent of cab aggregator Ola Cabs, said on Tuesday it has acquired geo-analytics technology platform GeoSpoc for an undisclosed sum. The acquisition will help platforms like Ola and Ola Electric to convert satellite imagery into real-time maps as well as 3D, high-definition (HD) and vector maps, Ola founder and chief executive Bhavish Aggarwal said in a blogpost on Tuesday.   This will help Ola’s platform provide a better understanding of road quality, as well as improvements such as avoiding poorly lit streets at night for safety – even if it is a faster route. With the acquisition, GeoSpoc’s investors will be exiting the startup, and its team will be joining Ola. In 2018, Ola acquired Ridlr, owned by Birds Eye Systems Pvt.

Maps will need to consider a 3D view of the world as aerial mobility models such as drones become more mainstream. (Further) autonomous driving will need HD and 3D maps which will offer superior visualization, dynamic real time updates based on road, traffic and weather conditions,” said Aggarwal, stating the reasons for the acquisition in the blogpost. “We have the data and the expertise to build this (better public transportation) utilizing our deep understanding of consumer movements as well as our massive network of two, three and four wheelers that provide unprecedented geo-spatial details.

Ltd among its investor.  “By combining live classes, assessments, and quality study material, we have built a highly specialised offering for students preparing for competitive exams,” said Shobhit Bhatnagar, CEO at Gradeup.  Byju’s has been on a buying spree and has shelled out over $2.2bn  in acquisitions, this year alone.  It  acquired  higher education platform Great Learning for $600 million, kids’ digital reading platform Epic for $500 million, and test preparation provider Aakash Educational Services for $1 billion in quick succession.  Byju’s has more than 65 million subscribers, but the edtech startup has seen faster growth over the past year, with at least 25 million new users signing up to use its platform after the lockdown was announced last year in March.  The edtech unicorn also got some of the largest cheques from institutional investors this year.

Zoho invests $5 mn in Voxelgrids,07 September,"Zoho Corp. is acquiring a 25% stake in Voxelgrids, a Bengaluru-based startup that builds magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanners.  It will invest $5mn, which will be made in two tranches over the next two years, is aimed at fostering development of deep technological capabilities and intellectual property (IP) in the country.“Our mission is to invest in critical technology know-how in India. This fits very well with that mission,” Sridhar Vembu, cofounder and chief executive officer, Zoho, said at a select roundtable on Tuesday.The investment comes at a time when close to 70% of the world's population has no access to MRI scanners, according to studies. Meanwhile in India, there are only 0.4 MRI scanners per thousand beds, with most of the access restricted to tier-1 cities.Moreover, in spite of India being a favourable medical tourism destination, procurement of diagnostic imaging equipment is still an expensive affair for hospitals and clinics, the brunt of which is borne by patients. The Indian market is dominated by either imported machines or refurbished equipment.Zoho aims to bridge this gap by helping in the development of indigenous MRI technology that provides a next-generation and cost-effective alternative that enables healthcare facilities to save on capital and operational expenditure.""One of the pressing concerns for the Indian economy today is the lack of indigenous industrial know-how and manufacturing capabilities. A healthy deep tech ecosystem is vital to solving this issue and driving structural economic change. Voxelgrids is one of the few companies that is working to solve this problem with MRI machines entirely built in India,” said Vembu.  “Deep tech products like ours require a significant amount of time from completing the R&D to taking the product to market, and most often, this is the time where we face insufficient funding. The investment from Zoho will help us bridge this gap and speed up our efforts to scale,"" said Arjun Arunachalam, CEO and founder, Voxelgrids.Voxelgrids has developed multiple technologies related to MRI scanners based on custom cryogenics and innovative electronic design and is looking to monetize it through OEM partnerships with other vendors in the field. The scanner can also be mounted on custom mobile platforms and transported to remote locations where the product can be made operational within a few hours.The operational costs such as electricity consumption is expected to be much lower than other scanners in its class. Voxelgrids also aims to have multiple full-fledged clinical sites before the end of this financial year.Share article on",https://www.vccircle.com//zoho-invests-5-mn-in-voxelgrids,Merger/Acquisition,"Meanwhile in India, there are only 0.4 MRI scanners per thousand beds, with most of the access restricted to tier-1 cities.Moreover, in spite of India being a favourable medical tourism destination, procurement of diagnostic imaging equipment is still an expensive affair for hospitals and clinics, the brunt of which is borne by patients.The investment from Zoho will help us bridge this gap and speed up our efforts to scale,"" said Arjun Arunachalam, CEO and founder, Voxelgrids.Voxelgrids has developed multiple technologies related to MRI scanners based on custom cryogenics and innovative electronic design and is looking to monetize it through OEM partnerships with other vendors in the field.",[],['5mn']

Park Group of Hospitals acquires Sonipat based Nidaan Hospital,13 July,"Ramesh Batra, promoter of Nidaan Hospital, one of the major landmarks in Sonipat in Haryana, had been in discussions to sell the hospital for over a year but valuation issues and Covid-19 came in the way. Four months earlier, boutique investment bank AMDP Advisors stepped in to advise Nidaan Hospital, resulting in its sale to Gurugram based Park Group of Hospitals. Drishti Pahwa and Adhiraj Mehra of AMDP Advisors said that the transaction will boost Nidaan Hospital's capacity to 250 beds to become the largest healthcare facility in the region. They declined to disclose the deal value but said that the transaction involved a complex structure with the complete takeover of Nidaan Hospital. ""Hospital deals are tough to transact and it is hard to close all the processes virtually. So, despite the Covid-19 we had to make arrangements for face to face meetings to complete the deal,"" said Pahwa. With the acquisition, Park Group of Hospitals will get access to a growing market in Sonipat that is becoming well known with big educational institutions coming up such as OP Jindal Global University and Ashoka University, explained Mehra. Nidaan Hospital's Batra will not be involved in the management and will pursue philanthropic work. The hospital's origin goes back to 1983 when Batra started offering medical services at a small rented clinic in Sonipat. It grew over the years to install the first cath lab in Haryana in 2001. It also boasts being the first to have intensive care facility and non-invasive cardiac evaluation lab in the region. Park Group of Hospitals was founded in 1982 by Ajit Gupta (chairman).

Metropolis Healthcare's biggest acquisition deal set to collapse,12 July,"Pathology chain Metropolis Healthcare Ltd's biggest acquisition deal which it had announced earlier this year is headed for a collapse. In a stock market disclosure over the weekend, Metropolis said that it can be assumed that Hitech Diagnostic Centre Pvt Ltd does not intend to close the transaction to sell itself to the Mumbai listed company. Metropolis is evaluating its rights, and the various routes available for their enforcement, and will accordingly take appropriate actions on this matter, it added. In January, Metropolis had said it will purchase 100% equity of Hitech in a combination of a cash-and-stock deal.  The cash consideration was decided at Rs 511 crore (about $70 million).  The transaction as contemplated under the sales and purchase agreement (SPA) was initiated but has not been wholly consummated till date. Meanwhile, the statutory approvals obtained by the Metropolis under SEBI's regulations have also lapsed, it said. Metropolis explained that it has been trying to conclude the transaction since April third week through various discussions and correspondences. It also issued a letter as recent as July 5 to which Hitech has not responded. Ameera Shah, managing director, Metropolis, had said in January that the acquisition is in line with the company’s strategy to gain market share in the cities of Chennai and Bengaluru. Hitech, which was founded in 1986 by SP Ganesan, has a network of 31 laboratories and 68 collection centres in the southern states of Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Kerala, Andhra Pradesh and the Union territory of Puducherry. An email sent to Hitech seeking comments on why it may not close the transaction did not elicit immediate response. This will not be the first time that an acquisition deal will fall through for Metropolis.  Last year, Metropolis had agreed to acquire a 51% stake in Shraddha Diagnostic Centre (I) Pvt. Ltd for Rs 9.36 crore (about $1.2 million) in an all-cash deal. However, this deal albeit much smaller in size fell through.  Metropolis has been quite active in chasing assets, particularly in the western region where it has a significant presence. In 2019, Metropolis acquired four labs to strengthen its presence in Surat, Gujarat, for a total of Rs 18 crore (about $2.45 million) in cash.  These labs were Doctor’s Clinical Laboratory, lyer Pathology Laboratory, Nagar Pathology Laboratory and Yash Clinical Laboratory. It had also acquired Gujarat-based Sanjeevani Pathology Laboratory in 2017 to strengthen its presence in the western region. The deal with Hitech would not only have been the biggest for Metropolis but one of the rare sizeable inorganic transactions in the diagnostics space in India. Last month, the diagnostics landscape witnessed a major surprise as new age digital healthcare firm PharmEasy has signed a definitive agreement to acquire a majority stake in diagnostics firm Thyrocare Technologies for Rs 4,546 crore ($613 million).  Share article on",https://www.vccircle.com//metropolis-healthcare-s-biggest-acquisition-deal-set-to-collapse,Merger/Acquisition,"In a stock market disclosure over the weekend, Metropolis said that it can be assumed that Hitech Diagnostic Centre Pvt Ltd does not intend to close the transaction to sell itself to the Mumbai listed company.Ameera Shah, managing director, Metropolis, had said in January that the acquisition is in line with the company’s strategy to gain market share in the cities of Chennai and Bengaluru.","['Hitech Diagnostic Centre Pvt Ltd', 'Chennai']","['about $70 million', 'about $1.2 million', 'about $2.45 million', '$613 million']"

"Asia M&A bonanza fuelled by Southeast Asia, private equity deals",02 July,"Asian merger and acquisition activity surged to its second-highest level ever for a first half as Southeast Asian and private-equity deals hit records, and bankers expect the strong momentum to be maintained for the rest of the year.Announced deals involving Asian companies came to $707.7 billion in January-June, up 75% from the same period a year earlier and not far off the record of $758.6 billion logged in the first half of 2018, Refinitiv data showed.Southeast Asia deals jumped 83% to a record $124.8 billion driven by blockbuster transactions including ride-hailing giant Grab's $40 billion merger with U.S. special-purpose acquisition company (SPAC) Altimeter Growth Corp.Bankers expect Southeast Asia to remain a big focus for dealmaking.""You still haven't seen capex demand come through because the Southeast Asian region is still kind of nascent in the recovery but you will start to see this re-emerging alongside refinancing and consolidation and M&A demand,"" said Amit Khattar, head of investment bank, Asia Pacific, at Deutsche Bank.He expects M&A in digital infrastructure such as data centres, telecommunication towers and the consumer sector, as well as real estate transactions, particularly in Singapore, as companies reassess office markets.Other chunky deals in Southeast Asia included the $18 billion merger of Grab's Indonesian rival Gojek with local e-commerce firm Tokopedia, and a $15 billion merger of the units of Malaysian telecoms firm Axiata Group and Norway's Telenor.""We're only half way through the year, but if market conditions remain constructive and based on our backlog, we look well placed to break all records,"" said David Biller, head of Citigroup's Southeast Asia banking, capital markets and advisory business.""The themes continue to be tech, consumer and healthcare.

Dealmakers drown in deals in second-quarter M&A frenzy,01 July,"Global mergers and acquisitions (M&A) activity broke records for a second consecutive quarter this year as companies continued to borrow cheaply and spend their cash reserves on transformative deals to reposition themselves for the post-COVID world.Deals worth $1.5 trillion were announced in the three months to June 30, more than any second quarter on record and up 13% from the record first quarter of the year despite activity among blank-check firms slowed down, Refinitiv data shows.""This is an environment we haven't seen before because we have very supportive financing markets combined with the pressure to come out of COVID-19 and reorganize entire businesses,"" said Alison Harding-Jones, head of M&A for Europe, the Middle East and Africa at Citigroup.""These high levels of activity will likely continue through the summer,"" she added.Second quarter volumes rose 440% in the United States with $699 billion worth of M&A deals compared to the same quarter last year when the world's biggest economy came to a halt because of the pandemic.President Joe Biden's proposed tax hikes drove some companies to rush to complete deals before proceeds get taxed at a higher rate.""Many transactions are happening because people want to announce and close before the end of the year. It makes sense on all sides from a tax perspective,"" said Anu Aiyengar, co-head of global M&A at JPMorgan Chase & Co.Dealmaking in Asia Pacific jumped 104% to $327 billion while Europe was up 50% to $293 billion.The biggest deals of the quarter were all done domestically, as companies hedged their bets and refrained from hunting outside their home turf, wary of rising protectionism and geopolitical tensions between China and the United States.""U.S. cross-border activity has decreased by just about every measure you can think about,"" said Vito Sperduto, co-head of global M&A at RBC Capital Markets.The $40 billion merger of Southeast Asia's biggest ride-hailing and food-delivery firm, Grab Holdings, with U.S. blank-check firm Altimeter was one of the few sizeable cross-border deals to top the quarterly charts.Size mattersWhile the global deal count suffered a 10% contraction compared to the first quarter, the M&A frenzy has translated into a spike in transactions value, with deals greater than $5 billion up 127% in the second quarter.In the United States, telecoms firm AT&T merged its content unit WarnerMedia with rival Discovery to create a media giant with an enterprise value of about $150 billion, while in Europe two German real estate giants - Vonovia and Deutsche Wohnen - tied the knot in a $34.5 billion merger.""Corporates have been reset by this crisis and their mantra is now simplification and digitalisation as they strive to become more focused and complement their business model with new technologies,"" said George Holst, head of the corporate clients group at BNP Paribas.The telecoms, media and technology (TMT) industry topped the M&A charts with a combination of deals, spin-offs and corporate reorganisations involving the likes of Dell Technologies Inc and Dutch-listed technology investor Prosus NV.Fearful of falling prey to activist investors, companies across all sectors have taken steps to review their operations and tackle non-performing units.""We expect a lot of sell-side activity in the second half of the year as many corporates are thinking about carve-outs right now.

Investors are no longer buying into these vehicles indiscriminately unless they have a solid story and management team,"" said Dominic Lester, European head of investment banking at Jefferies.Fast and furiousThe decline in SPAC activity was largely offset by a flurry of private equity-backed buyouts which rose 152% in the first six months of the year to $512 billion, representing 18% of global M&A volumes.""What we're seeing now is cheapness of capital.

UK's private equity firm Actis to acquire Fortum's two Indian solar projects,23 June,"UK's infrastructure-focused private equity firm Actis has signed a deal to acquire Finnish state-controlled firm Fortum Oyj’s two solar power plants in India for around 280 million euros (approximately Rs 2,480 crore or $335 million). “Fortum has signed an agreement to divest the 250 megawatt Pavagada II and the 250 MW Rajasthan solar power plants in India to Actis, a global infrastructure investment firm. The total consideration from the divestment on a debt and cash-free basis, including the effect of deconsolidating the net debt, is expected to be approximately 280 million euros, most of which will be recorded during 2021,"" said a company statement. While Fortum has divested its entire stake in the Pavagada II project, it still retains 51% stake in the Jaisalmer project in Rajasthan as per regulatory requirements. The deal with an equity value of around 100 million euros also involves Actis contributing equity to develop projects in India and overseas along with Fortum. ""This is an important step for Actis as we further strengthen our presence in India building on our achievements to date,"" said Mikael Karlsson, partner and head of energy infrastructure at Actis.The sale is part of Fortum’s build-operate-transfer business model strategy to take risks early on and eventually monetise a project to raise capital for new ventures. “The divestment will be completed, and the capital gain recorded in three tranches; during the second half of 2021 and the first half of 2022,"" the statement further said. Earlier this month, Actis promoted its energy infrastructure director Abhishek Bansal to the post of a partner. The London-based PE firm entered India in 2012. It started making renewable energy investments in India just before Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led government in early 2015 decided to install 175 gigawatt of renewable energy capacity, including 100 GW of solar power, by 2022.   Since then, the British investor has constructed 680 MW of solar power plants in India. In October last year, it had planned to invest as much as $1 billion in India’s renewable energy sector over the next five years.   In June 2018, Fortum had agreed to sell a 54% stake in 185 MW solar projects in India to UK Climate Investments (40%) and Elite Alfred Berg (14%). Actis entered India’s renewable energy sector in late 2014 with an initial commitment of $230 million to Ostro Energy Pvt Ltd. It subsequently increased the commitment to $300 million, before selling Ostro to ReNew Power Pvt Ltd in 2018.   Asia remains a key market for Actis as it grows its infrastructure investments in the region. Share article on",https://www.vccircle.com//uk-s-private-equity-firm-actis-to-acquire-fortum-s-two-indian-solar-projects,Merger/Acquisition,"The total consideration from the divestment on a debt and cash-free basis, including the effect of deconsolidating the net debt, is expected to be approximately 280 million euros, most of which will be recorded during 2021,"" said a company statement.""This is an important step for Actis as we further strengthen our presence in India building on our achievements to date,"" said Mikael Karlsson, partner and head of energy infrastructure at Actis.The sale is part of Fortum’s build-operate-transfer business model strategy to take risks early on and eventually monetise a project to raise capital for new ventures.",[],"['$335 million', 'as much as $1 billion', '$230 million', '$300 million']"

Bankruptcy tribunal okays Jet's revival plan proposed by Kalrock Capital and Jalan,22 June,"In a step ahead for the revival of embattled Jet Airways, the bankruptcy tribunal has approved the resolution plan of London-based Kalrock Capital and UAE-based businessman Murari Lal Jalan. The National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) on Tuesday okayed the consortium’s plan subject to further approvals, as per a report by PTI. The consortium has proposed to repay banks, financial institutions and employees around Rs 1,200 crore over next five years and plans to establish Jet Airways as a full-service airline with 30 aircraft with an investment of around Rs 1,375 crore over a two-year period.  The NCLT is yet to upload the final order. However, it is understood that, as part of the revival plan, the tribunal has given 90 days to the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) and aviation ministry to allot slots to debt-laden Jet Airways. While under insolvency, Jet Airways’ slots at major airports and its traffic rights were awarded temporarily to other airlines by the DGCA and the ministry last year. Its operating permit is dormant and would need to be made active and licences of pilots and engineers would need to be renewed. In a recent affidavit submitted before the tribunal, the ministry of corporate affairs and DGCA had said Jet Airways could not claim historicity to obtain the slots and that allocation of slots would be done as per existing guidelines. The approval by the NCLT was stuck since then. Jet Airways had suspended operations on April 17, 2019 due to financial distress and has been undergoing a resolution process under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) since June that year. In October 2020, a State Bank of India (SBI)-led Committee of Creditors (CoC) had approved the resolution plan by Dubai-based entrepreneur Jalan and German investor Florian Fritsch, who owns the UK-based financial advisory and alternative asset manager Kalrock Capital. The airline owes more than Rs 8,000 crore ($1.08 billion) to banks and is facing claims of Rs 24,887 crore from various creditors including banks, suppliers and employees. The NCLT has admitted claims worth Rs 14,000 crore. Jet Airways had started as an air taxi operator in May 1993, with a fleet of four leased Boeing 737-300 aircraft. The Naresh Goyal-founded airline became a scheduled carrier in 1995 and got publicly listed in February 2005.  Share article on",https://www.vccircle.com//bankruptcy-tribunal-okays-jet-s-revival-plan-proposed-by-kalrock-capital-and-jalan,Merger/Acquisition,"However, it is understood that, as part of the revival plan, the tribunal has given 90 days to the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) and aviation ministry to allot slots to debt-laden Jet Airways.In a recent affidavit submitted before the tribunal, the ministry of corporate affairs and DGCA had said Jet Airways could not claim historicity to obtain the slots and that allocation of slots would be done as per existing guidelines.","['the Directorate General of Civil Aviation', 'Jet Airways', 'DGCA', 'Jet Airways']",['$1.08 billion']

"Tribunal doubts confidentiality maintained in Videocon bankruptcy process, requests IBBI probe",16 June,"A Mumbai bench of insolvency tribunal has expressed surprise over the similarity between the bid value offered by Twin Star Technologies Ltd, a promoter entity of Vedanta Resources group founded by Anil Agarwal, and the liquidation value of the target firm Videocon Industries. In what is a 95.8% haircut to bankers, the resolution plan of Rs 2,962 crore proposed by Twin Star Technologies to acquire bankrupt conglomerate Videocon Industries was approved by the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) last week.  The plan was approved by the lenders led by State Bank of India in November last year with a majority vote share of 95.09% in the 19th Committee of Creditors (CoC) meeting. The Vedanta Resources group firm will acquire 13 companies of the Videocon group which has presence in consumer electronics, home appliances, oil and gas, telecom services, digital solutions, real estate, and electronic retail chain, among other segments. In the order now uploaded on its website, the NCLT has pointed out that while the fair value estimated by registered valuers stood at Rs 4,069 crore for the 13 companies, the liquidation value is Rs 2,568 crore. “Surprisingly the resolution applicant also valued all the assets and liabilities of all the 13 companies and arrived at almost the same value,” NCLT said in the order dated 8 June. The total admitted claims regarding the 13 group companies of Videocon Industries stood at Rs 64,938 crore. The resolution plan will mean a recovery of a meagre 4.15% for all creditors and 5.33% for financial creditors. Videocon Industries was controlled by Venugopal Dhoot and his family before lenders dragged it to the NCLT in December 2017 and pushed it into the corporate insolvency resolution process (CIRP) in June 2018. “As per regulations, the liquidation value and fair market value is kept as confidential and is told to the CoC members only at the time of finalising the resolution plan. Even in the present case the resolution bids were opened in the 15th CoC meeting held on 2 September, 2020 wherein liquidation value and fair market value were told to the members of CoC,” the NCLT order stated. It further said that a “doubt arises upon the confidentiality clause being in real time use, therefore, we request IBBI (Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India) to examine this issue in depth so as to ensure the confidentiality clause is followed unscrupulously, without any compromise in letter and spirit by all the concerned parties and entities connected.” The tribunal further directed that “IBBI can frame appropriate regulations, safeguards for the maximisation of value of the assets which will benefit all the stakeholders”. Resolution plan Under the resolution plan, Twin Star Technologies has proposed an upfront cash payment of Rs 200 crore to financial creditors, non-convertible debentures (NCDs) of Rs 2,700 crore to financial creditors, with an interest of 6.65% per annum. Workmen and employees will get approximately Rs 52 crore and operational creditors will get Rs 10 crore as upfront cash payment from the funds infused by the resolution applicant. The amount will be distributed proportionately between operational and statutory dues. The NCLT has also requested both the CoC and Twin Star Technologies to consider increasing the payout to operational creditors, which are largely medium and small sized enterprises. “They may themselves be subject to insolvency proceedings in the future,” it said. Post implementation of the plan, the assenting financial creditors will receive 8% of equity holding in the new entity, on a post money fully diluted basis, against their admitted debt. As part of the implementation, shares of Videocon Industries and Value Industries will be delisted from the stock exchanges. Of the 13 Videocon Group companies, 11 firms will merge into Videocon Industries. Besides Twin Star Technologies, V-Shape Investment Management Limited’s plan was shortlisted by the CoC.Share article on",https://www.vccircle.com//bankruptcy-tribunal-surprised-by-the-bid-value-for-videocon-industries,Merger/Acquisition,"Even in the present case the resolution bids were opened in the 15th CoC meeting held on 2 September, 2020 wherein liquidation value and fair market value were told to the members of CoC,” the NCLT order stated.It further said that a “doubt arises upon the confidentiality clause being in real time use, therefore, we request IBBI (Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India) to examine this issue in depth so as to ensure the confidentiality clause is followed unscrupulously, without any compromise in letter and spirit by all the concerned parties and entities connected.” The tribunal further directed that “IBBI can frame appropriate regulations, safeguards for the maximisation of value of the assets which will benefit all the stakeholders”.","['CoC', 'NCLT', 'Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India']",[]

Tata Digital to acquire majority stake in digital health platform 1mg,10 June,"Tata Digital, a 100% subsidiary of Tata Group holding entity Tata Sons, has acquired a majority stake in e-pharmacy and health technology platform 1mg as it builds out a unified consumer ecommerce platform.  The financial details of the deal were not disclosed. The announcement comes weeks after the automotive-to-technology services conglomerate picked up majority ownership in online grocery platform BigBasket and invested in health and fitness startup Cure Fit Healthcare. The three deals are expected to serve as a launchpad for Tata’s digital ambitions.  “The investment in 1MG is in line with Tata Group’s vision of creating a digital ecosystem which addresses the consumer needs across categories in a unified manner. e-pharmacy, e-diagnostics and tele-consultation are critical segments in this ecosystem and have been among the fastest growing segments in this space, as this sector enabled access to healthcare through the pandemic,” Tata Digital said in a statement.  Digital healthcare, a $1 billion opportunity at present, will form a key element of the Tata Digital ecosystem offering.  “The investment in 1MG strengthens Tata’s ability to provide superior customer experience and high-quality healthcare products and services in e-pharmacy and e-diagnostics space through a technology led platform,” Pratik Pal, CEO of Tata Digital, said.  Tata Digital had made an investment commitment of nearly Rs 100 crore into the company in April. Founded in 2011 by Prashant Tandon, Gaurav Agarwal and Vikas Chauhan, 1mg clocked a total revenue of Rs 369.3 crore in financial year 2019-20 (FY20).

"Bankruptcy cases: Setback for DHFL promoter, Jaiprakash Associates' Manoj Gaur woos lenders",25 May,"An appeals tribunal has stayed an order by the lower body that had last week asked the administrator of Dewan Housing Finance Corporation Ltd (DHFL) to table a settlement offer from promoter Kapil Wadhawan before lenders.This came after DHFL's administrator R Subramaniakumar moved National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) on Monday challenging the order of National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT). Wadhawan, an accused in the Yes Bank loan bribery case, has proposed many times full payment to creditors including holders of non-convertible debentures and fixed deposits, suggesting no haircuts. Creditors led by State Bank of India (SBI) have termed Wadhawan’s proposal as flimsy, replete with misrepresentations and falsehoods, and without financial backing or commitments. Billionaire Ajay Piramal-led Piramal group, which received the lenders’ nod for acquisition in January as well as the central bank’s approval the following month, also moved the NCLAT challenging the NCLT order. In its appeal, Piramal observed that NCLT had reserved judgment in granting nod to the Piramal resolution plan in January 2021. “Almost five months later, the latest NCLT order will cause havoc with the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) process and, hence, must be stayed,” Piramal said adding that Wadhawan's proposal is neither a settlement offer nor a resolution plan. The administrator has also questioned NCLT order’s timing given that the bench is to retire in June and any delay could lead to a situation where the case would have to be re-argued before a new bench. The lenders appeal said, “The order has the effect of creating a disruption from the strict discipline of the timelines set out under the resolution process and has the effect of compelling the CoC (committee of creditors) to vote on a settlement proposal offered by Wadhawan, which the CoC in its commercial wisdom had chosen not to.” The appeal has sought a direction from the NCLAT to pass an order on the offer by the Piramal group within one week.  The matter is scheduled to be heard next on June 25. DHFL, the first financial services firm to be dragged into bankruptcy on the order of the central bank, owes around Rs 91,000 crore to various creditors which include mutual funds, banks, pension funds, insurance firms and retail investors.Jaypee InfratechBankrupt real estate developer Jaypee Infratech’s promoter has urged lenders to consider a settlement offer first submitted before the Supreme Court in 2019. In a letter dated May 23, addressed to insolvency resolution professional Anuj Jain, executive chairman of Jaiprakash Associates Manoj Gaur has proposed to repay the debts without any “haircuts”, by making an upfront payment of Rs 9,783 crore, doing land swap, and via long-term debentures with a total value of about Rs 12,500 crore. For homebuyers, Gaur has proposed to deploy Rs 1,650 crore to construct units, of which Rs 400 crore would be upfront. He also claimed the homebuyers would get additional benefits including Rs 2,987 crore compensation for delay, and that fixed deposits and dues of Yamuna Expressway Infrastructure Development Authority would also be paid back in entirety, as per the PTI. Lenders of Jaypee Infratech had yesterday decided to defer vote on the winning resolution plan, giving two more days to Suraksha Group and state-owned NBCC (India) Ltd for filing revised bids. On Friday, VCCircle had reported that, after the fourth bidding round, Suraksha held an edge over NBCC in the lenders’ vote that was set to start Monday and last a couple of days.The troubled township developer has debt of around Rs 22,600 crore under the insolvency process. The CoC led by IDBI Bank and homebuyers is scheduled to meet on Thursday and Friday to decide on the resolution plans by NBCC and Suraksha. Share article on",https://www.vccircle.com//bankruptcy-cases-setback-for-dhfl-promoter-jaiprakash-associates-manoj-gaur-woos-lenders,Merger/Acquisition,"The lenders appeal said, “The order has the effect of creating a disruption from the strict discipline of the timelines set out under the resolution process and has the effect of compelling the CoC (committee of creditors) to vote on a settlement proposal offered by Wadhawan, which the CoC in its commercial wisdom had chosen not to.” The appeal has sought a direction from the NCLAT to pass an order on the offer by the Piramal group within one week.DHFL, the first financial services firm to be dragged into bankruptcy on the order of the central bank, owes around Rs 91,000 crore to various creditors which include mutual funds, banks, pension funds, insurance firms and retail investors.Jaypee InfratechBankrupt real estate developer Jaypee Infratech’s promoter has urged lenders to consider a settlement offer first submitted before the Supreme Court in 2019.","['Wadhawan', 'CoC', 'NCLAT', 'Piramal', 'DHFL', 'the Supreme Court']",[]

The platform has on-boarded over 280 higher education institutes, nearly 50,000 teachers, and around six lakh learners within seven years. “The synergy of Impartus and upGrad will pave the way for augmenting college education by helping learners upskill with new-age courses, thus elevating their candidature for better career prospects,” said Mahensaria, chief executive of upGrad Campus. Temasek-backed upGrad is hopeful that the move will enable it to add 50,000 paid learners in the very first year of acquisition. In April this year, upGrad secured $120 million from Singapore state investor Temasek in its first external funding. Founded in 2015, the online tutor platform has over one million total registered learners in more than 50 countries globally. In November, it bought test-prep platform The Gate Academy which is focused on GATE (Graduate Aptitude Test in Engineering) and government job examinations. The edtech sector has been attracting increased investor attention after the pandemic sparked a surge in demand for online learning platforms and solutions.  Earlier this month, Teachmint Technologies Pvt Ltd, focused on tutor-student connectivity, raised $16.5 million (Rs 123 crore) in a Series A funding round.   Last month, edtech market leader Byju’s raised over $455 million (Rs 3,328 crore) in the second tranche of its Series F fundraise, the move reportedly bumping up its valuation to $15 billion (about Rs 1.13 lakh crore).   Byju's also acquired test-prep firm Aakash Educational Services in a $1 billion deal last month.  Earlier in January, Unacademy, which joined the unicorn club of startups valued at $1 billion or more last year, said four existing investors had purchased shares worth $50 million (Rs 366 crore). Share article on",https://www.vccircle.com//upgrad-buys-impartus-rebrands-startup-to-target-higher-education-and-colleges,Merger/Acquisition,"“Aligned with our vision, upGrad Campus will bolster our presence in the university education space and help the youth of Bharat learn the necessary skills needed to become more employable and join the workforce as leaders of tomorrow,” said Ronnie Screwvala, chairman of upGrad.Last month, edtech market leader Byju’s raised over $455 million (Rs 3,328 crore) in the second tranche of its Series F fundraise, the move reportedly bumping up its valuation to $15 billion (about Rs 1.13 lakh crore).","['Campus', 'Bharat']","['$20.6 million', '$120 million', '$16.5 million', 'over $455 million', '$15 billion', '$1 billion', '$1 billion', '$50 million']"

Tata Digital gets CCI nod to pick up majority stake in BigBasket,29 April,"The Competition Commission of India (CCI) on Wednesday said it has approved Tata Digital’s proposal to acquire a majority stake in Supermarket Grocery Supplies (SGS), the parent company and B2B operator of e-grocer BigBasket. According to the proposal, Tata Digital will acquire up to 64.3% in SGS through a combination of primary and secondary transactions.  Subsequently, SGS may acquire sole control of Innovative Retail Concepts, which runs the consumer-facing business of BigBasket, under license from SGS. The deal will give Tata Digital control of BigBasket’s retail and B2B business arms.  Tata Digital is a wholly owned subsidiary of Tata Sons, which is the ultimate holding company of entities under the Tata Sons group. The deal will reportedly result in an enterprise value of Rs 13,500 crore or $1.8 billion for BigBasket. The grocery delivery startup was valued at $1.2 billion in October 2019, according to an auditor’s report, when it acquired hyperlocal grocery delivery platform DailyNinja.   In April last year, it raised around $60 million in a bridge round of funding led by Alibaba.  For the financial year 2019-20, SGS reported consolidated net sales of Rs 3,794 crore, and losses of Rs 611 crore, as per VCCEdge data. 
 
The latest deal is also expected to create an exit for BigBasket’s largest shareholder and Chinese internet company Alibaba E-commerce, which held a 16.45% stake in the company as of FY20, as well as Abraaj Group, which held a 15.02% stake during the period. The acquisition of the Bengaluru based startup, which competes with giants Flipkart and Amazon, would tie into the conglomerate’s strategy of launching a super app for the group’s consumer-facing businesses.  Last week, Tata Digital committed to invest nearly Rs 100 crore in epharmacy and health technology platform 1mg. The Gurugram based startup received 25% of the amount, while Rs 75 crore is to be paid according to terms of the Class 7 CCD issued. According to several media reports, Tata Group is expected to acquire a majority stake in 1MG. These acquisitions are expected to strengthen Tata’s proposed ecommerce play across retail, grocery, epharmacy and other sectors. It will also help the group take on Amazon, Reliance Industries, and Walmart-owned Flipkart in India's booming ecommerce market. Share article on",https://www.vccircle.com//tata-digital-gets-cci-nod-to-pick-up-majority-stake-in-bigbasket,Merger/Acquisition,"The Competition Commission of India (CCI) on Wednesday said it has approved Tata Digital’s proposal to acquire a majority stake in Supermarket Grocery Supplies (SGS), the parent company and B2B operator of e-grocer BigBasket.The latest deal is also expected to create an exit for BigBasket’s largest shareholder and Chinese internet company Alibaba E-commerce, which held a 16.45% stake in the company as of FY20, as well as Abraaj Group, which held a 15.02% stake during the period.","['The Competition Commission', 'Tata Digital’s', 'Supermarket Grocery Supplies', 'SGS', 'BigBasket', 'BigBasket', 'Abraaj Group']","['$1.8 billion', '$1.2 billion', 'around $60 million']"

The scandal saw many of its top executives leave, and policyholders pull their funds.Last year, it was further rocked by complaints about the promotion of banker Boe Pahari to head of AMP Capital after being the subject of allegations of inappropriate conduct.

The travel portal will continue to operate as a separate brand and will retain all its employees. It will work closely with Flipkart to enhance its technology solutions. Stuart Crighton, CEO and co-founder of Cleartrip, said that the company is excited about the positive impact this collaboration can have on customers and the travel industry in general. The deal is subject to regulatory approvals. Cleartrip was founded in 2006 by Crighton, Hrush Bhatt and Matthew Spacie, who is not with the company anymore. It offers a platform for booking hotels, flights and trains. In 2016, it launched Cleartrip Local, a platform that offers curated activities and experiences. The company has raised funding from Concur Technologies, Draper Fisher Jurvetson, DAG Ventures and Gund Investment Corporation. In 2018, Cleartrip bought Saudi Arabia-based Flyin in its first cross-border acquisition. The company also strengthened its top deck over the years with the appointments of former Quikr technology head Manoj Sharma as chief technology officer and former Tata Consultancy Services executive Indroneel Dutt as chief financial officer. Share article on",https://www.vccircle.com//flipkart-to-acquire-cleartrip-to-diversify-business,Merger/Acquisition,"The plan to acquire Cleartrip comes amidst travel restrictions in many parts of the globe in the wake of the new surge in coronavirus infections.Stuart Crighton, CEO and co-founder of Cleartrip, said that the company is excited about the positive impact this collaboration can have on customers and the travel industry in general.","['Cleartrip', 'Cleartrip']",[]

Global M&A sets first-quarter record as dealmakers shape post-COVID world,01 April,"Mergers and acquisitions (M&A) activity surged globally in the first quarter of 2021 to a year-to-date record, as companies and investment firms rushed to get ahead of changes in how people work, shop, trade and receive healthcare during the COVID-19 pandemic.While the number of deals was up only 6% from a year ago, the total value of pending and completed deals rose 93% to $1.3 trillion, the second-biggest quarter on record, according to data provider Refinitiv.Dealmakers said a boom in the stock market and low borrowing costs - driven by the Federal Reserve's loose monetary policies - emboldened companies, private equity funds and blank-check acquisition firms to pursue their dream deals. This is despite the global economy's failure to have fully recovered as yet from the virus' financial fallout.""This is as robust and broad-based an M&A market as I have witnessed in the last 20 years,"" said Colin Ryan, co-head of Americas M&A at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. ""We are in an environment where assets are scarcer than the available capital right now.""Dealmaking surged in most sectors of the economy, especially the technology industry, which is positioning for big changes in cloud computing and collaboration spurred on by the shift to remote working.Real estate was the only sector to record a major slump in M&A activity, as offices and other types of commercial property became less appealing to buyers.""We are still in an uncertain world. The first half will look pretty strong in M&A but in the kind of world today, it takes a brave soul to forecast a $4 trillion-plus market for the year,"" said Mark Shafir, global co-head of M&A at Citi.Around half the deal activity came from United States where volumes were up 160% year on year at $654.1 billion.The Asia Pacific region, excluding central Asia, was up 44.9% at $206.5 billion.In contrast, M&A activity in Europe was up 24.5% year on year at $277.3 billion, as mega-deals became more difficult to negotiate with the French government blocking a proposed 16.2 billion euro takeover of European retailer Carrefour SA by Canada's Alimentation Couche-Tard in January.""This year we have seen a continuation of cross-border activity. This is set to continue amidst a more positive business environment with vaccines becoming available, Brexit coming together and sustained low interest rates,"" said Celia Murray, JPMorgan's head of M&A for the UK which is Europe's biggest M&A market.Major deals in the quarter included Ireland's AerCap Holdings NV agreeing to buy General Electric Co's aircraft leasing business for more than $30 billion, Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd clinching a $25 billion deal for U.S. railway Kansas City Southern, and National Grid's purchase of WPD, England's largest electricity distribution business, for 7.8 billion pounds ($10.76 billion).Overall, volumes of deals worth more than $5 billion totaled $476 billion, up 133% year on year.""What you're seeing right now and will see to an even greater extent throughout the year is strategics coming out of hibernation and trying to do the things they've been thinking about for months,"" said Alan Klein, co-head of M&A at Simpson Thacher.A key factor in getting deals done was sell-side price expectations coming down, making it easier for investors to price assets.""The valuation gap has narrowed during the pandemic. Both realism and uncertainty have played a part in that,"" said Bob Bishop, global co-chair of DLA Piper's corporate group.A further catalyst for activity could come from activist investors, which are shareholders in a company agitating for change. In the first quarter, the likes of department store Kohl's Corp, French food and beverage company Danone SA and oil giant Exxon Mobil were subjects of activist campaigns.""During the pandemic most activists primarily engaged privately behind closed doors and as a result public campaigns were significantly down compared to 2019,"" said Philipp Beck, EMEA M&A head at UBS Group AG.""However, as markets normalize and corporates refocus on strategic portfolio decisions we anticipate more public engagement by activists.""SPAC AttackWith plentiful access to cheap debt, private equity firms jumped on the deal frenzy. Their deals rose 115.8% to $250.6 billion.""Private equity funds are standing front and centre in the dealmaking arena and driving a strong pipeline of public-to-private transactions,"" said Dwayne Lysaght, JPMorgan's co-head of EMEA M&A.Supporting M&A in the United States has been a surge in deal activity among special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs), which have captured the interest of Wall Street and amateur traders seeking quick profit.US SPAC MA volume was $172.3 billion in the first quarter, up 3,000% year on year and almost 75% of the total SPAC deal activity worldwide.In many cases, SPACs have emerged as serious competition to private equity bidders.""It's a different kind of competition since SPACs only want minority stakes and it's certainly a different proposition. But it makes us think that there is a wall of capital out there that is ready to be invested in either minority or majority deals,"" said Patrick Frowein, co-head of EMEA investment banking coverage and advisory at Deutsche Bank.Dealmakers said the strength of the global economy and state of the markets would dictate whether 2021 will be a record year for dealmaking.""Current momentum could be derailed by a resurgence of inflation, a resulting increase in interest rates, or declining confidence - but I don't expect this in the near or intermediate term,"" said Peter Weinberg, founding partner and chief executive of Perella Weinberg Partners.Share article on",https://www.vccircle.com//global-m-a-sets-first-quarter-record-as-dealmakers-shape-post-covid-world,Merger/Acquisition,"Mergers and acquisitions (M&A) activity surged globally in the first quarter of 2021 to a year-to-date record, as companies and investment firms rushed to get ahead of changes in how people work, shop, trade and receive healthcare during the COVID-19 pandemic.While the number of deals was up only 6% from a year ago, the total value of pending and completed deals rose 93% to $1.3 trillion, the second-biggest quarter on record, according to data provider Refinitiv.Dealmakers said a boom in the stock market and low borrowing costs - driven by the Federal Reserve's loose monetary policies - emboldened companies, private equity funds and blank-check acquisition firms to pursue their dream deals.The first half will look pretty strong in M&A but in the kind of world today, it takes a brave soul to forecast a $4 trillion-plus market for the year,"" said Mark Shafir, global co-head of M&A at Citi.Around half the deal activity came from United States where volumes were up 160% year on year at $654.1 billion.The Asia Pacific region, excluding central Asia, was up 44.9% at $206.5 billion.In contrast, M&A activity in Europe was up 24.5% year on year at $277.3 billion, as mega-deals became more difficult to negotiate with the French government blocking a proposed 16.2 billion euro takeover of European retailer Carrefour SA by Canada's Alimentation Couche-Tard in January.","['COVID-19', ""the Federal Reserve's"", 'Carrefour SA', 'Alimentation Couche-Tard']","['$1.3 trillion', '$4 trillion', '$654.1 billion', '$206.5 billion', '$277.3 billion', '16.2 billion euro', 'more than $30 billion', '$25 billion', '7.8 billion pounds', '10.76', 'more than $5 billion', '$476 billion', '$250.6 billion', '$172.3 billion']"

TCG-backed Haldia Petrochemicals gets third time lucky with Nagarjuna Oil Corp,19 March,"Two years after the lenders of Nagarjuna Oil Corporation rejected Haldia Petrochemicals’ resolution plan, a bankruptcy court has cleared the proposal under the liquidation process.  Haldia Petrochemicals Ltd, majority owned by The Chatterjee Group (TCG), is set to buy Nagarjuna Oil Corporation Ltd (NOCL) after the Chennai bench of the National Company Law Tribunal approved a resolution plan for the refinery project under the liquidation process of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code.  V Mahesh, liquidator of the firm, confirmed that the development had been pronounced in the open court but the NCLT order is yet to be published.  This is likely Purnendu Chatterjee- led TCG’s second acquisition via the bankruptcy courts, after one of its wholly owned subsidiaries acquired debt-ridden Garden Silk Mills Ltd in January.  Hyderabad-based NOCL, an associate firm of publicly-listed Nagarjuna Oil Refinery Ltd, owed a total of nearly Rs 11,000 crore to almost 17 financial creditors.  NOCL is a joint venture of Nagarjuna Fertilizers & Chemicals and Tamil Nadu Industrial Development Corporation.  When it was set up, the project was supposed to be one of the biggest for the Tamil Nadu government. Despite several tax incentives offered during a global investor meet held in 2015, the project got stalled due to a shortage of funds, previous reports said.  NOCL's refinery project in Cuddalore was supposed to go on stream in 2012, but faced numerous delays, including a cyclone in 2011. A Hindu report said that time and cost overruns escalated the costs to around Rs 15,000 crore from the initial estimate of 3,500 crore.  Not an easy journey  Haldia Chemicals’ proposal to revive Nagarjuna Oil was  in the works for three years.    When NOCL was initially admitted into insolvency in July 2017, it received bids from Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL) and Citax Energy DMCC, which were placed before the Committee of Creditors (CoC) in March 2018.   After both plans failed to make the cut, a fresh invitation was issued. This time prospective bidders included West Bengal-based Haldia Petrochemicals and GP Global, UAE, formerly known as Gulf Petrochem along with the previous bidders from the last round.  Of the four, Haldia Petrochemicals’ plan was submitted to the COC by the resolution professional but  98% of the lenders voted against it as the amount offered was far below the liquidation value. Later in 2018, the CoC once again reviewed two resolution plans submitted  afresh by the Gulf Petrochem and Haldia Petrochemicals. Gulf Petroleum’s proposal stood at Rs 655.61 crore while Haldia Petrochemicals’ resolution plan offer was at Rs 1,456 crore -- just above the liquidation value.  However, Haldia’s plan also contained several “conditions precedent” which would fetch financial creditors a value of Rs 1,042 crore through preference and redeemable shares only two years after NCLT approval, the tribunal had said in a previous order. This did not get lender approval.  As a result in December 2018, the NCLT bench ordered liquidation of Nagarjuna Oil Corp after none of the resolution plans  materialised.    While the Gulf Petroleum offer was much lower, Haldia’s plan would have resulted in over 90% haircut for the secured financial creditors with no concrete and significant payment to other stakeholders, NCLT had said in 2018 while ordering liquidation.  However, Haldia Petrochemicals ultimately won the bid under liquidation. Details of the resolution plan are yet to be disclosed but the liquidation price is unlikely to top previous bids.   Share article on",https://www.vccircle.com//tcg-backed-haldia-petrochem-gets-nclt-nod-to-revive-bankrupt-nagarjuna-oil-corp,Merger/Acquisition,"Haldia Petrochemicals Ltd, majority owned by The Chatterjee Group (TCG), is set to buy Nagarjuna Oil Corporation Ltd (NOCL) after the Chennai bench of the National Company Law Tribunal approved a resolution plan for the refinery project under the liquidation process of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code.Of the four, Haldia Petrochemicals’ plan was submitted to the COC by the resolution professional but  98% of the lenders voted against it as the amount offered was far below the liquidation value.","['Haldia Petrochemicals Ltd', 'The Chatterjee Group', 'Nagarjuna Oil Corporation Ltd', 'Chennai', 'the National Company Law Tribunal', 'the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code', 'Haldia Petrochemicals', 'COC']",[]

Axis Bank to buy stake in Max Bupa Health's promoter,15 March,"Bain Capital-backed Axis Bank will acquire a 9.9% stake in the promoter entity of Max Bupa Health Insurance Company for Rs 90.8 crore. Axis Bank entered into definitive agreements with Fettle Tone LLP and its partners on March 13 for the purchase. Fettle Tone, a special purpose vehicle set up by True North Fund VI LLP in May 2019, holds about 55.6% stake in the health insurance firm. Max Bupa Health Insurance is a joint venture between private equity group True North and Bupa, a global health insurance and healthcare company. Till December 15, 2019, it was a JV of two promoter entities – Max India Limited and Bupa Singapore Holdings. Post that, Max India exited the Max Bupa JV and its shares were transferred to Fettle Tone. The acquisition is proposed to be completed on or before March 17, 2021, the filing said.  The object of the acquisition is to “strengthen Axis Bank’s position in the insurance sector,” it added. Fettle Tone had a turnover of Rs 0.16 crore in March 2020 and its net worth stands at Rs 706 crore. The announcement comes after VCCircle reported in October 2020 that Axis Bank had tweaked its plans and revised agreements with Max Financial Services to acquire a around 19% stake in Max Life Insurance Company. Axis Bank and subsidiaries got the insurance regulator’s approval in October last year to pick up a 12% stake in Max Life Insurance. The bank will itself initially buy 9.002% while Axis Capital and Axis Securities will purchase up to 3%. The two units will also have the right to acquire another 7-19% stake in the firm. This paves the way for Axis firms to become a joint venture partner in the life insurance company. Axis Bank had in April last year decided to buy a 29% stake in Max Life Insurance but reduced the size of the stake to 17% in August after objections from the insurance regulator. The lender had first invested in Max Life Insurance a decade ago. Its plan to take a bigger stake in the insurer was aimed at beefing up its presence in the insurance industry. Share article on",https://www.vccircle.com//axis-bank-to-buy-stake-in-max-bupa-health-s-promoter,Merger/Acquisition,The announcement comes after VCCircle reported in October 2020 that Axis Bank had tweaked its plans and revised agreements with Max Financial Services to acquire a around 19% stake in Max Life Insurance Company.Axis Bank had in April last year decided to buy a 29% stake in Max Life Insurance but reduced the size of the stake to 17% in August after objections from the insurance regulator.,"['VCCircle', 'Axis Bank', 'Max Financial Services', 'Max Life Insurance Company', 'Max Life Insurance']",[]

Unacademy acquires Blume Ventures-backed TapChief,16 February,"Sorting Hat Technologies, which runs edtech unicorn Unacademy, has acquired a majority stake in Pilani Experts Technology Labs-owned professional networking and consulting platform TapChief.  Post deal, TapChief was valued of Rs 100 crore, as per a statement. The deal also offered exits to all of TapChief’s existing investors. Further financial terms of the deal were not disclosed.Homegrown investment firm Blume Ventures has backed both Bengaluru-based firms. In its last known funding round, TapChief raised $1.5 million seed capital in December 2019 from Blume. The infusion followed an angel round earlier that year, which saw TapChief raise $650,000 from investors including fintech startup Paytm, Cred founder Kunal Shah, Udhyam founder Mekin Maheshwari and early-stage venture fund and seed accelerator 500 Startups. The company had also raised funds in June 2019 and November 2016.TapChief was founded in 2016 by Shashank Murali, Binay Krishna, and Arjun Krishna from the hostel rooms at BITS Pilani. The company calls itself a ‘future-of-work’ platform and leverages a host of technology solutions to enable professionals to interact and learn from experts, develop their personal brand and land contracts and projects with businesses. It claims to have over 1,50,000 registered professionals who use the platform to collaborate with experts from their chosen domains and take up short-term professional projects.“Our endeavour at Unacademy has always been to democratise education and make learning accessible and affordable for everyone. TapChief shares a similar ethos in a different space, as evident from the open community of professionals and learners they’ve created,” Gaurav Munjal, co-founder and CEO of Unacademy, said.TapChief caters to over 150 enterprise customers across sectors such as education, FMCG, ecommerce, enterprise SaaS and upskilling. According to the company, professionals on the platform have completed over 50,000 gigs.Unacademy’s growth strategy has primarily been through the inorganic route. In 2020, the company acquired six startups. The NeoStencil, PrepLadder, Kreatryx and Coursavy buys deepened its reach in the test-preparation segment. It strengthened its presence in the K12 learning space with Blume-backed Mastree -- offering an exit to the investor in July 2020 -- and the programming segment with CodeChef.Unacademy, on the other hand, was set up as an educational YouTube channel in 2016 by Munjal, Roman Saini, Hemesh Singh and Sachin Gupta. It helps educators create lessons on the Educator App, which learners access via the Learning App. It has more than 49,000 educators and over 40 million learners across 5,000 cities in 14 languages.Four of its existing investors -- Tiger Global, Dragoneer Investment Group, Steadview Capital and General Atlantic -- bought shares worth $50 million in January as part of its latest fundraising exercise.Unacademy's earliest investors include Blume Ventures, Waterbridge Ventures, Nexus Venture Partners, Elevation Capital and Sequoia Capital.Unacademy in September last year raised $150 million in a funding round led by SoftBank, catapulting the edtech company’s valuation to $1.45 billion. With this, Unacademy became the only other edtech unicorn in India besides Byju's.Within months of the SoftBank-led funding, it added Tiger Global Management and Dragoneer Investment Group as investors at a valuation of $2 billion.Edtech startups have attracted significant investor attention in the past few years, especially in pandemic-ridden 2020, which forced schools, colleges and universities shut.  Byju's, Vedantu, Toppr and Eruditus received big cheques last year.Share article on",https://www.vccircle.com//unacademy-acquires-blume-ventures-backed-tapchief,Merger/Acquisition,"It strengthened its presence in the K12 learning space with Blume-backed Mastree -- offering an exit to the investor in July 2020 -- and the programming segment with CodeChef.Unacademy, on the other hand, was set up as an educational YouTube channel in 2016 by Munjal, Roman Saini, Hemesh Singh and Sachin Gupta.It has more than 49,000 educators and over 40 million learners across 5,000 cities in 14 languages.Four of its existing investors -- Tiger Global, Dragoneer Investment Group, Steadview Capital and General Atlantic -- bought shares worth $50 million in January as part of its latest fundraising exercise.Unacademy's earliest investors include Blume Ventures, Waterbridge Ventures, Nexus Venture Partners, Elevation Capital and Sequoia Capital.Unacademy in September last year raised $150 million in a funding round led by SoftBank, catapulting the edtech company’s valuation to $1.45 billion.","['K12', 'Mastree', 'YouTube', 'Steadview Capital', 'General Atlantic', 'Blume Ventures', 'Waterbridge Ventures', 'Nexus Venture Partners', 'Elevation Capital', 'Sequoia Capital', 'SoftBank']","['$1.5 million', '650,000', '$50 million', '$150 million', '$1.45 billion', '$2 billion']"

Future creditors scramble to recover $2.5 bn loans: Bankers,16 February,"Future Group's creditors are exploring options to recover more than $2.5 billion in loans, amid worries the Indian retailer's planned sale of assets to Reliance Industries could fail, four bankers with knowledge of the matter said.Future may face liquidation if the deal, already mired in legal wrangling, falls through and banks are actively discussing an alternate one-time restructuring option that could include an easier repayment tenure and fresh capital infusion, the people said on condition of anonymity as the talks are private.""Without Reliance, there is no future for Future,"" one of the bankers at a major state-owned lender said.Bankers have discussed a restructuring plan in the past week and are drawing up a blueprint, the sources said.Future's top financial creditors include India's largest lender State Bank of India, along with smaller rivals Bank of Baroda and Bank of India.The three banks, Future Group and Reliance did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Future, India's No.2 retailer with more than 1,700 stores, has been hit hard by the pandemic and agreed to sell most of its retail assets to Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance in a $3.4 billion deal.The transaction, however, has faced legal hurdles with e-commerce giant Amazon.com alleging that Future, by agreeing to sell assets to Reliance, was violating terms of a deal the U.S. firm had struck with a Future Group entity.Future denies any wrongdoing.The deal was temporarily blocked by a New Delhi court but subsequently the order was struck down.

India shortlists four banks for potential privatisation,15 February,"India's government has shortlisted four mid-sized state-run banks for privatisation, under a new push to sell state assets and shore up government revenues, three government sources said.Privatisation of the banking sector, which is dominated by state-run behemoths with hundreds of thousands of employees, is politically risky because it could put jobs at risk but Prime Minister Narendra Modi's administration aims to make a start with second-tier banks.The four banks on the shortlist are Bank of Maharashtra, Bank of India, Indian Overseas Bank and the Central Bank of India, two officials told Reuters on condition of anonymity as the matter is not yet public.Two of those banks will be selected for sale in the 2021/2022 financial year which begins in April, the officials said. The shortlist has not previously been reported.The government is considering mid-sized to small banks for its first round of privatisation to test the waters. In the coming years it could also look at some of the country's bigger banks, the officials said.The government, however, will continue to hold a majority stake in India's largest lender State Bank of India, which is seen as a 'strategic bank' for implementing initiatives such as expanding rural credit.A finance ministry spokesman declined to comment on the matter.India's deepest economic contraction on record caused by the pandemic is driving the push for bolder reforms, economists say.New Delhi also wants to overhaul a banking sector reeling under a heavy load of non-performing assets, which are likely to rise further once banks are allowed to categorise loans that soured during the pandemic as bad.Modi's office initially wanted four banks to be put up for sale in the coming fiscal year, but officials have advised caution fearing resistance from unions representing the employees.Bank of India has a workforce of about 50,000 and Central Bank of India has 33,000 staff, while Indian Overseas Bank employs 26,000 and Bank of Maharashtra has about 13,000 employees, according to estimates from bank unions.Bank of Maharashtra's smaller workforce could make it easier to privatise and therefore potentially one of the first to be sold, the sources said.On Monday workers started a two-day strike opposing the government's move to privatise banks and sell stakes in insurance and other companies.The actual privatisation process may take 5-6 months to start, one of the government sources said.""Factors like number of employees, pressure of the trade unions and political repercussions would impact a final decision,"" the source said, noting that the privatisation of a particular bank could be subject to change at the last moment due to these factors.The government hopes that the Reserve Bank of India, the country's banking regulator, will soon ease lending restrictions on Indian Overseas Bank after an improvement in the lender's finances that could help its sale.Some economists said there could be a few takers for weak and small banks - saddled with bad assets - but that Modi should consider the sale of bigger banks like Punjab National Bank or Bank of Baroda. The sale of small banks was unlikely to help the government raise much in the way of resources for budget spending, they said.""The government should consider what gives it a better pricing without compromising its long-term goal of financing the growing Indian economy,"" said Devendra Pant, chief economist at India Ratings, the Indian arm of Fitch ratings agency.Share article on",https://www.vccircle.com//india-shortlists-four-banks-for-potential-privatisation,Merger/Acquisition,"India's government has shortlisted four mid-sized state-run banks for privatisation, under a new push to sell state assets and shore up government revenues, three government sources said.Privatisation of the banking sector, which is dominated by state-run behemoths with hundreds of thousands of employees, is politically risky because it could put jobs at risk but Prime Minister Narendra Modi's administration aims to make a start with second-tier banks.The four banks on the shortlist are Bank of Maharashtra, Bank of India, Indian Overseas Bank and the Central Bank of India, two officials told Reuters on condition of anonymity as the matter is not yet public.Two of those banks will be selected for sale in the 2021/2022 financial year which begins in April, the officials said.In the coming years it could also look at some of the country's bigger banks, the officials said.The government, however, will continue to hold a majority stake in India's largest lender State Bank of India, which is seen as a 'strategic bank' for implementing initiatives such as expanding rural credit.A finance ministry spokesman declined to comment on the matter.India's deepest economic contraction on record caused by the pandemic is driving the push for bolder reforms, economists say.New Delhi also wants to overhaul a banking sector reeling under a heavy load of non-performing assets, which are likely to rise further once banks are allowed to categorise loans that soured during the pandemic as bad.Modi's office initially wanted four banks to be put up for sale in the coming fiscal year, but officials have advised caution fearing resistance from unions representing the employees.Bank of India has a workforce of about 50,000 and Central Bank of India has 33,000 staff, while Indian Overseas Bank employs 26,000 and Bank of Maharashtra has about 13,000 employees, according to estimates from bank unions.Bank of Maharashtra's smaller workforce could make it easier to privatise and therefore potentially one of the first to be sold, the sources said.On Monday workers started a two-day strike opposing the government's move to privatise banks and sell stakes in insurance and other companies.The actual privatisation process may take 5-6 months to start, one of the government sources said.","['Bank of Maharashtra, Bank of India', 'Indian Overseas Bank', 'the Central Bank of India', 'Reuters', 'State Bank of India', 'Bank of India', 'Central Bank of India', 'Indian Overseas Bank', 'Bank of Maharashtra', ""Bank of Maharashtra's""]",[]

"Fighting Amazon over retail deal, Future says staring at insolvency, hit to bank loans",03 February,"If India's Future Group cannot sell assets, $4 billion in bank loans and debentures will be at risk, pushing its retail unit into insolvency, the company said in a court filing on Wednesday against Amazon.com Inc, which wants to block the sale.A court in New Delhi blocked Future Group's sale of retail assets to Reliance Industries on Tuesday after Amazon raised objections to the deal.The corporate battle has embroiled sprawling businesses led by two of the world's richest men: Amazon's Jeff Bezos and Reliance's Mukesh Ambani.Amazon had argued that Future breached contracts by selling retail assets to Reliance. The court sided with the U.S. firm, saying an earlier order from an arbitrator that put the Future-Reliance deal on hold was valid.Future - which had argued the arbitrator's order was not binding - on Wednesday filed a challenge against the court's ruling, saying the company's creditors would be at ""significant risk"" if the Reliance deal fails.Other than an estimated 300 billion rupees ($4.1 billion) hit to bank loans and debentures, the deal's failure would also impact livelihoods of 50,000 employees and 6,000 small- and medium-sized vendors, it said.""It is inevitable that FRL (Future Retail) will go into liquidation ... The magnitude of damage that may be caused to the public at large is unimaginable,"" Future said the court filing, seen by Reuters.The appeal is set to be heard on Thursday before a bigger two-judge bench in New Delhi.Future, India's second-largest retailer with more than 1,700 stores, and Amazon did not respond to a request for comment.Shares of Future Retail dropped 5% in early trading on Wednesday. Reliance Industries fell as much as 1.2%, but recovered later.The Delhi court on Tuesday asked Indian authorities to maintain status quo on the transaction, effectively putting the Future-Reliance deal on hold.Indian stock exchanges and the country's antitrust watchdog had already cleared the deal, though it was awaiting approval from a law tribunal.Future in its appeal said Tuesday's Delhi court order ""rendered stillborn"" the approvals.""The sole and sheer intent"" of Amazon was to prevent Reliance - which is also venturing into e-commerce - from acquiring Future's assets, the Indian firm argued in the filing.Amazon, which had its sights set on ultimately owning part of Future's retail assets itself, has argued a 2019 deal it had with a unit of Future contained clauses prohibiting the Indian group from selling them to anyone on a ""restricted persons"" list, including Reliance.Share article on",https://www.vccircle.com//future-to-challenge-court-order-blocking-retail-deal-in-dispute-with-amazon,Merger/Acquisition,"If India's Future Group cannot sell assets, $4 billion in bank loans and debentures will be at risk, pushing its retail unit into insolvency, the company said in a court filing on Wednesday against Amazon.com Inc, which wants to block the sale.A court in New Delhi blocked Future Group's sale of retail assets to Reliance Industries on Tuesday after Amazon raised objections to the deal.The corporate battle has embroiled sprawling businesses led by two of the world's richest men: Amazon's Jeff Bezos and Reliance's Mukesh Ambani.Amazon had argued that Future breached contracts by selling retail assets to Reliance.The court sided with the U.S. firm, saying an earlier order from an arbitrator that put the Future-Reliance deal on hold was valid.Future - which had argued the arbitrator's order was not binding - on Wednesday filed a challenge against the court's ruling, saying the company's creditors would be at ""significant risk"" if the Reliance deal fails.Other than an estimated 300 billion rupees ($4.1 billion) hit to bank loans and debentures, the deal's failure would also impact livelihoods of 50,000 employees and 6,000 small- and medium-sized vendors, it said.","['Future Group', 'Amazon.com Inc', ""Future Group's"", 'Reliance Industries', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'Reliance', 'Amazon', 'Reliance', 'Reliance']","['$4 billion', 'an estimated 300 billion rupees', '$4.1 billion']"

Amazon scores win as court freezes Future's $3.4 bn retail deal,02 February,"An Indian court blocked Future Group's sale of a swathe of assets to rival Reliance Industries on Tuesday after Amazon raised objections to the $3.4 billion deal, in a battle of the retail titans that could reshape the shopping sector.The decision is a setback for Future, the country's second-largest retailer with over 1,700 stores, which agreed to sell its retail businesses to market leader Reliance last year. It has said it could face liquidation if the deal falls through.U.S. online giant Amazon, which had its sights set on ultimately owning part of the retail assets itself, argued a 2019 deal it had with a unit of Future contained clauses prohibiting the Indian group from selling them to anyone on a ""restricted persons"" list including Reliance.The corporate battle has embroiled sprawling businesses led by two of the world's richest men - Amazon's Jeff Bezos and Reliance's Mukesh Ambani.It could help determine whether Amazon will be able to eat away at the dominance of Reliance, which sells through its network of more than 12,000 stores, at a time when the COVID-19 pandemic has seen shoppers race online.After Future said it was not bound by an arbitrator's order that put the deal on hold, Amazon last month urged the High Court in New Delhi to enforce it.Justice J. R. Midha said on Tuesday that an immediate order was necessary to protect the U.S. company's rights, adding that the arbitrator had ""rightly proceeded"" against Future.""This court is of the clear view that the (arbitration) order ... is enforceable,"" Midha added. ""All the concerned authorities are directed to maintain status quo.""Amazon said it welcomed the order. Future said it would explore all legal remedies to pursue the deal.Reliance did not respond to requests for comment.Legal brainsFuture's planned deal to sell its retail, wholesale, logistics and certain other businesses to Reliance for $3.38 billion, including debt, had already been cleared by Indian stock exchanges and the antitrust watchdog, though it was awaiting approval from a law tribunal.Justice Midha directed a federal government counsel to relay the court's decision to all authorities who were involved in reviewing the Future-Reliance deal. Future had acted ""in violation"" of the arbitrator's order, he added.Both Future and Amazon hired some of the country's best legal brains to argue the matter, with the U.S. company engaging law firms P&A Law Offices and AZB & Partners.Future, in sometimes acrimonious court arguments, accused Amazon of blocking its deal in an attempt to thwart any competition from Reliance, which has plans to expand into e-commerce.Amazon said at some point it wanted to become a single largest shareholder of Future Retail, which it says ""has an irreplaceable and widespread network"" of outlets across India.Share article on",https://www.vccircle.com//delhi-high-court-gives-interim-relief-to-amazon-in-dispute-with-future-group,Merger/Acquisition,"online giant Amazon, which had its sights set on ultimately owning part of the retail assets itself, argued a 2019 deal it had with a unit of Future contained clauses prohibiting the Indian group from selling them to anyone on a ""restricted persons"" list including Reliance.The corporate battle has embroiled sprawling businesses led by two of the world's richest men - Amazon's Jeff Bezos and Reliance's Mukesh Ambani.It could help determine whether Amazon will be able to eat away at the dominance of Reliance, which sells through its network of more than 12,000 stores, at a time when the COVID-19 pandemic has seen shoppers race online.After Future said it was not bound by an arbitrator's order that put the deal on hold, Amazon last month urged the High Court in New Delhi to enforce it.Justice J.

Is the budget vaccine shot a boon or bane for corporate M&As?,02 February,"The initial verdict of the stock market and market participants seems to indicate that Finance Bill 2021 is indeed the Budget of the new decade. The Union Budget seems to have addressed multiple concerns such as affordable housing, boost to the economy by strategic disinvestment and infrastructure development, and rationalisation of various tax provisions to reduce tax litigation, etc. At the same time, it has also clarified the intention of legislators as regards taxability or obligation of taxpayers for undertaking certain transactions. Some key tax highlights of Budget 2021 impacting corporate M&As are discussed hereunder:Incentives for startupsAs per existing law, deduction of 100% profits and gains of an eligible business by an eligible startup is allowed for three consecutive assessment years out of 10 years, at the option of the taxpayer, provided the startup is incorporated on or after April 1, 2016 but before April 1, 2021. Budget 2021 proposes to extend the date of incorporation of startups by one more year i.e. startups incorporated prior to April 1, 2022 shall also be eligible to avail the above benefit.REIT, InvITLast year’s Budget amended the tax regime for taxation of dividend declared by Indian corporates. The dividends were made taxable in the hands of the recipient and the obligation was also cast on the corporate declaring dividend to withhold the tax at the prescribed rate depending on the residential status of the recipient. As regards receipt of dividend by InvIT and REIT from the operating companies, while the exemption was provided to InvITs and REITs, there was no corresponding exemption granted to companies declaring dividend to InvIT and REIT from withholding tax. Budget 2021 proposes to provide exemption from withholding tax on payment of dividend to REIT and InvIT. Sovereign wealth fund, pension fund In order to boost investment in the infrastructure sector, last year’s Budget had inserted a provision under Indian tax laws to provide exemption to sovereign wealth funds (SWFs) and pension funds (PFs) (subject to fulfilment of prescribed conditions) from income in the nature of dividend, interest or long-term capital gains arising from an investment made by it in India. There were certain questions which remained unanswered during the year. Based on representations received, Budget 2021 proposes to rationalise certain provisions, thereby removing difficulties in meeting the necessary conditions for availing exemption. Some of the amendments proposed are as under:The aforesaid relaxations would enable structuring the India investment in accordance with the commercial objectives and will boost the foreign investment in the country and lead to infrastructure development along with employment opportunities.Zero-coupon bond by infra debt fundThe government has notified Infrastructure Debt Fund (IDF) under the Indian tax laws to issue a zero-coupon bond. However, the definition of zero-coupon bond had not been amended to include the same.The said anomaly is proposed to be corrected by Budget 2021 by making necessary amendments in the definition of zero-coupon bond to incorporate an IDF as well. Further, it is also proposed to exclude income from zero coupon bonds from withholding tax provisions. This will provide a huge impetus to the infrastructure sector and invite more companies to form infrastructure debt funds and raise funds by the issue of zero-coupon bond for long-term purposes.Slump exchange included in definition of slump sale Slump sale means the transfer of one or more undertakings as a result of sale for lump sum consideration without values being assigned to individual assets and liabilities. However, transfer of undertaking other than by way of sale (commonly referred to as slump exchange) was not provided for under the Indian tax laws. The question whether a transaction is a slump sale or slump exchange was a matter of debate. As a result, certain high value transactions were implemented by way of slump exchange.While deciding the taxability of such transactions, the Bombay High Court in the case of Bharat Bijlee Limited held that if the transaction of transfer of the undertaking has taken place by mode other than sale, it cannot be considered and taxed as slump sale. Consequently, the concept of slump exchange evolved and was distinguished from slump sale. As a result, it was held that the slump exchange was not subject to tax.The revenue department’s appeal against the judgment of Bombay High Court was pending before the Supreme Court and hence undertaking a transaction by way of slump exchange (other than for commercial reasons) was always a matter of debate.Budget 2021 has addressed this uncertainty. It now proposes to tax all transactions which are covered under the definition of transfer viz. exchange, extinguishment, relinquishment, etc. The above amendment is in line with the concept of ‘substance over form’. This amendment will take effect from the financial year starting from April 1, 2020 onwards and hence any slump exchange transaction already implemented in the current financial year (2020-21) could not be argued as not subject to tax. Depreciation on goodwillThis is yet another topic which has been a matter of debate over a long period of time.The question is whether goodwill of a business, which is similar to business or commercial right, is an asset under the Indian tax laws eligible for depreciation. This question came up before the Supreme Court in the case of Smiffs Securities Limited. The Supreme Court held that goodwill is a depreciable asset eligible for depreciation under the Indian tax laws.In order to negate the above ruling, Budget 2021 has proposed as under:While the above two amendments relating to taxation of slump exchange and depreciation on goodwill confirm the intention of legislature, this may be a matter of concern for corporates since the amendments seek to overturn the ruling of the High Court and the Supreme Court, respectively. Additionally, Budget 2021 did not address the concerns of stressed companies, especially in connection with the following: Concluding remarks Budget 2021 can simply be called a “vaccine shot for corporate M&As”. While the Union Budget 2021 has not brought about any breathtaking relaxations, it has made the intention of the legislature loud and clear by proposing amendments as regards taxation of slump exchange and non-availability of depreciation on goodwill of a business or profession. The incentives proposed by the government on affordable housing and the plans for strategic disinvestment suggest that the intention is to fight back against the pandemic and to come out victorious.Considering the approach of the government on certain aspects mentioned above, only time will tell whether India Inc finds the Union Budget 2021 a boon or a bane. Anil Talreja is partner, Pushkar Khire is director, and Ankit Panchal is manager with Deloitte Haskins and Sells LLP.Share article on",https://www.vccircle.com//is-the-budget-vaccine-shot-a-boon-or-bane-for-corporate-m-as,Merger/Acquisition,"The dividends were made taxable in the hands of the recipient and the obligation was also cast on the corporate declaring dividend to withhold the tax at the prescribed rate depending on the residential status of the recipient.The Supreme Court held that goodwill is a depreciable asset eligible for depreciation under the Indian tax laws.In order to negate the above ruling, Budget 2021 has proposed as under:While the above two amendments relating to taxation of slump exchange and depreciation on goodwill confirm the intention of legislature, this may be a matter of concern for corporates since the amendments seek to overturn the ruling of the High Court and the Supreme Court, respectively.","['The Supreme Court', 'the High Court', 'the Supreme Court']",[]

Quess invests Rs 10 cr in B2B gig jobs startup; reports 42% dip in Q3 profit,28 January,"Staffing and other business services provider Quess Corp on Wednesday said it will invest Rs 10 crore (about $1.4 million), via multiple tranches, in Stellarslog Technovation in exchange for a 49% stake at the Bengaluru-based startup.Stellarslog Technovation, parent owner of online gig workers marketplace Taskmo, will issue 1,92,156 equity shares at a rate of Rs 520, as per an exchange filing.Quess said it will pay Rs 2 crore for a 16.1% equity stake by January 31. ""Post completion of the stipulated investment or 1st April 2022, whichever is later, Quess shall also have the right to increase its stake to 51% on-a fully diluted basis via a call option,"" it added.Taskmo is an online marketplace for businesses to outsource their operational and on-the-ground tasks to a distributed network of gig-workers.The deal marks Quess’ entry in the Indian digital gig economy, it said, adding that Taskmo complements Quess’ current portfolio of human resource services that houses skilled workers under permanent, temporary, as well as on-demand models. Taskmo, via its website and Play Store app, uses a proprietary algorithm to train, match and deploy gig workers, the statement added. The move, Quess said, is aimed at catapulting the 13 year old company’s entry into an Indian gig economy that is estimated to be worth $4 billion by 2025. “Task based work models are here to stay, and will augment existing labour models. This investment will add to Quess’ growing digital arsenal, alongside WorQ, Qjobs and MarQet. We are excited to be accelerating this young and visionary team and look forward to winning together,” Quess Corp CEO Suraj Moraje said.Taskmo, formerly called FeedMyPockets, was founded in 2017 by software engineers Prashant Janadri, and Naveen Ram. “We believe Taskmo’s digital-first approach combined with Quess’ scale will form a formidable force in digital workforce management. This partnership marks a pivotal point in our journey towards making access to jobs a fundamental right for every Indian and inspires us to work doubly hard,” Janadri said.Stellarslog Technovation generated revenues of Rs 1.61 crore in the financial year ended March 2020 (FY20), and had over 11,000 users as on December 31, 2020, Quess said. In FY19, it registered revenues of Rs 1.43 crore, and Rs 74 lakh in FY18.Other players operating in the space include venture backed vertical players such as Awign, Apna.co, Able Jobs, Gigforce, as well as horizontal players such as Google’s Kormo Jobs.Separately on Wednesday, Bengaluru-headquartered Quess Corp reported a 41.5% decrease in quarterly profit in a period that saw continued disruption in business activity due to the novel coronavirus’ impact on the economy.The company said its profit attributable to shareholders of the company fell to Rs 41.75 crore or Rs 2.79 per share in the third quarter ended December 2020, from Rs 71.32 or Rs 4.83 per share, a year earlier.Total revenue dipped 4.8% to Rs 2,817.74 crore.The company’s board said its business operations in the reported quarter continued to be affected by applicable regulatory restrictions including stay-at-home or work-from-home requirements of the central and state governments in India, and other disruptive factors owing to Covid-19.Share article on",https://www.vccircle.com//quess-to-buy-b2b-gig-jobs-startup-for-rs-10-cr-reports-42-dip-in-q3-profit,Merger/Acquisition,"""Post completion of the stipulated investment or 1st April 2022, whichever is later, Quess shall also have the right to increase its stake to 51% on-a fully diluted basis via a call option,"" it added.Taskmo is an online marketplace for businesses to outsource their operational and on-the-ground tasks to a distributed network of gig-workers.The deal marks Quess’ entry in the Indian digital gig economy, it said, adding that Taskmo complements Quess’ current portfolio of human resource services that houses skilled workers under permanent, temporary, as well as on-demand models.In FY19, it registered revenues of Rs 1.43 crore, and Rs 74 lakh in FY18.Other players operating in the space include venture backed vertical players such as Awign, Apna.co, Able Jobs, Gigforce, as well as horizontal players such as Google’s Kormo Jobs.Separately on Wednesday, Bengaluru-headquartered Quess Corp reported a 41.5% decrease in quarterly profit in a period that saw continued disruption in business activity due to the novel coronavirus’ impact on the economy.The company said its profit attributable to shareholders of the company fell to Rs 41.75 crore or Rs 2.79 per share in the third quarter ended December 2020, from Rs 71.32 or Rs 4.83 per share, a year earlier.Total revenue dipped 4.8% to Rs 2,817.74 crore.The company’s board said its business operations in the reported quarter continued to be affected by applicable regulatory restrictions including stay-at-home or work-from-home requirements of the central and state governments in India, and other disruptive factors owing to Covid-19.Share article on","['Quess', 'Awign', 'Google', 'Quess Corp', 'Rs', 'Rs 2,817.74']","['about $1.4 million', '$4 billion']"
Future Retail seeks tribunal OK for $3.4 bn asset sale deal; Amazon pushes to block,28 January,"India’s Future Retail has approached a tribunal to seek a key approval for its $3.4 billion asset sale to Reliance Industries, its lawyer told a court on Thursday, even as partner Amazon tries to block the transaction.Amazon is locked in bitter legal disputes with Future and alleges the Indian firm violated some of their pre-existing contracts by selling its retail assets to Reliance last year. Future denies any wrongdoing.Indian stock exchanges last week cleared Future’s deal with Reliance but another key approval is needed from the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT), as per Indian law. The approval is key for Future to seal the deal, without which the country’s second largest retailer could face liquidation.The outcome of the dispute embroiling Future, Reliance and Amazon is seen shaping India’s retail landscape, especially in deciding who will take the top spot in the fast-growing groceries market all are competing in.Future has filed a petition with the NCLT on Jan. 26, Darius Khambata, the lawyer for Future, told the Delhi High Court during a hearing in a separate ongoing legal fight over the deal.In the court, Amazon and Future are currently arguing over the applicability of an October injunction by a Singapore arbitrator, which both sides agreed to use in case of disputes. The arbitrator had said the Future-Reliance deal should be put on hold.Future has maintained the arbitration order is not binding on it, while Amazon says it is.Lawyers for Amazon on Thursday criticized Future during the hearing for approaching the NCLT for approval, while the Delhi court was hearing a matter over the deal.The judge will continue to hear the arguments on Friday.The dispute centres around Future’s decision in August to sell its retail, wholesale, logistics and some other businesses to Reliance for $3.38 billion, including debt.Amazon argues that a 2019 deal it had with a Future unit had clauses saying the Indian group couldn’t sell its retail assets to anyone on a “restricted persons” list, including Reliance.Share article on",https://www.vccircle.com//future-retail-seeks-tribunal-ok-for-3-4-bn-asset-sale-deal-amazon-pushes-to-block,Merger/Acquisition,"The approval is key for Future to seal the deal, without which the country’s second largest retailer could face liquidation.The outcome of the dispute embroiling Future, Reliance and Amazon is seen shaping India’s retail landscape, especially in deciding who will take the top spot in the fast-growing groceries market all are competing in.Future has filed a petition with the NCLT on Jan. 26, Darius Khambata, the lawyer for Future, told the Delhi High Court during a hearing in a separate ongoing legal fight over the deal.In the court, Amazon and Future are currently arguing over the applicability of an October injunction by a Singapore arbitrator, which both sides agreed to use in case of disputes.The arbitrator had said the Future-Reliance deal should be put on hold.Future has maintained the arbitration order is not binding on it, while Amazon says it is.Lawyers for Amazon on Thursday criticized Future during the hearing for approaching the NCLT for approval, while the Delhi court was hearing a matter over the deal.The judge will continue to hear the arguments on Friday.The dispute centres around Future’s decision in August to sell its retail, wholesale, logistics and some other businesses to Reliance for $3.38 billion, including debt.Amazon argues that a 2019 deal it had with a Future unit had clauses saying the Indian group couldn’t sell its retail assets to anyone on a “restricted persons” list, including Reliance.Share article on","['Future', 'Reliance', 'Amazon', 'Future', 'the Delhi High Court', 'Amazon', 'Future-Reliance', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'Future', 'Reliance', 'Amazon', 'Future', 'Reliance']","['$3.4 billion', '$3.38 billion']"

"Amazon tries to block Future's retail asset sale, seeks CEO's detention",25 January,"Amazon.com Inc has requested an Indian court to block partner Future Group's $3.4 billion deal to sell its retail assets and called for the Indian group's CEO to be detained, a court filing seen by Reuters showed.In the U.S. giant's latest effort to derail Future's asset sale to Reliance Industries, it asked the High Court in New Delhi to enforce the decision of a Singapore arbitrator, which Amazon and Future had agreed to use in case of disputes, the filing showed.In October, the arbitrator issued an interim order saying Future's deal with Reliance should be put on hold.Future has ""deliberately"" disobeyed the arbitrator's order without challenging it, Amazon argued in its court filing, which is likely to be heard by the court in New Delhi later this week.Any violation of the arbitrator order invites the ""same consequences"" as a violation of an Indian court order would, Amazon argued, urging the court to also detain Future Group CEO Kishore Biyani, and some other respondents in the case, in a civil prison.Future, in a statement to India's BSE and NSE stock exchanges, said it had been informed by Amazon lawyers about the court filing, and that it would defend the case.Future and a spokesman for Biyani, as well as Reliance, did not respond to Reuters' requests for comment. Amazon declined to comment.Amazon has also asked the court to attach assets of Biyani to the case so they can't be disposed of. Biyani is often dubbed India's retail king for transforming the country’s retailing in recent decades.Amazon argues Future breached some pre-existing clauses by entering into a deal with Reliance, but the Indian group has maintained the arbitrator's order is not binding and needs to be ratified by an Indian court.The U.S. group's latest court move comes after Indian stock exchanges last week gave the go ahead to the Future deal, after communicating with India's markets regulator, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI).The Amazon filing also argued that Future should not rely on any regulatory approval it has received, in light of the arbitrator's injunction.The dispute centres around Future's decision in August to sell its retail, wholesale, logistics and some other businesses to Reliance for $3.38 billion, including debt.Amazon argues that a 2019 deal it had with a Future unit had clauses saying the Indian group couldn’t sell its retail assets to anyone on a ""restricted persons"" list including Reliance.The outcome of the dispute embroiling Future, Reliance and Amazon is seen shaping India's retail landscape, especially in deciding who will occupy the top spot in the groceries market which could be worth around $740 billion a year by 2024, according to a forecast by Forrester Research. Share article on",https://www.vccircle.com//amazon-tries-to-block-future-s-asset-sale-to-reliance-after-regulatory-approval,Merger/Acquisition,"Amazon.com Inc has requested an Indian court to block partner Future Group's $3.4 billion deal to sell its retail assets and called for the Indian group's CEO to be detained, a court filing seen by Reuters showed.In the U.S. giant's latest effort to derail Future's asset sale to Reliance Industries, it asked the High Court in New Delhi to enforce the decision of a Singapore arbitrator, which Amazon and Future had agreed to use in case of disputes, the filing showed.In October, the arbitrator issued an interim order saying Future's deal with Reliance should be put on hold.Future has ""deliberately"" disobeyed the arbitrator's order without challenging it, Amazon argued in its court filing, which is likely to be heard by the court in New Delhi later this week.Any violation of the arbitrator order invites the ""same consequences"" as a violation of an Indian court order would, Amazon argued, urging the court to also detain Future Group CEO Kishore Biyani, and some other respondents in the case, in a civil prison.Future, in a statement to India's BSE and NSE stock exchanges, said it had been informed by Amazon lawyers about the court filing, and that it would defend the case.Future and a spokesman for Biyani, as well as Reliance, did not respond to Reuters' requests for comment.Biyani is often dubbed India's retail king for transforming the country’s retailing in recent decades.Amazon argues Future breached some pre-existing clauses by entering into a deal with Reliance, but the Indian group has maintained the arbitrator's order is not binding and needs to be ratified by an Indian court.The U.S. group's latest court move comes after Indian stock exchanges last week gave the go ahead to the Future deal, after communicating with India's markets regulator, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI).The Amazon filing also argued that Future should not rely on any regulatory approval it has received, in light of the arbitrator's injunction.The dispute centres around Future's decision in August to sell its retail, wholesale, logistics and some other businesses to Reliance for $3.38 billion, including debt.Amazon argues that a 2019 deal it had with a Future unit had clauses saying the Indian group couldn’t sell its retail assets to anyone on a ""restricted persons"" list including Reliance.The outcome of the dispute embroiling Future, Reliance and Amazon is seen shaping India's retail landscape, especially in deciding who will occupy the top spot in the groceries market which could be worth around $740 billion a year by 2024, according to a forecast by Forrester Research.","['Amazon.com Inc', ""Future Group's"", 'Reuters', 'Future', 'Reliance Industries', 'the High Court', 'Amazon', 'Future', 'Future', 'Reliance', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'Future Group', 'BSE', 'NSE', 'Amazon', 'Biyani', 'Reliance', 'Reuters', 'Amazon', 'Reliance', 'Future', 'the Securities and Exchange Board of India', 'Amazon', 'Future', 'Reliance', 'Amazon', 'Future', 'Reliance', 'Future', 'Reliance', 'Amazon', 'Forrester Research']","['$3.4 billion', '$3.38 billion', 'around $740 billion']"
"Orion Credit spins out of Olympus Capital, secures investment from Omers",25 January,"Singapore-based private equity arm Olympus Capital Asia’s credit arm has spun out to form a new venture, Orion Credit Capital Asia Pte Ltd, it said on Monday.""In December, the management team, which has spearheaded private credit efforts of Olympus Capital Asia since 2012, spun out from Olympus Capital Asia and rebranded the private credit business as Orion Capital Asia,"" it said in a statement.As part of this transition, Orion Credit Capital has secured an equity investment from OMERS (Ontario Municipal Employees Retirement System), a Canadian pension fund.In a statement, Orion Credit said it will focus on direct lending in the Asia-Pacific region and will manage investment vehicles that will provide medium-term secured loans to mid-market enterprises sponsored by PE firms and local entrepreneurs.The loans provided by these vehicles will help target companies finance their growth and acquisitions, with investments involving diverse sectors and bespoke solutions.The development comes nearly a year after VCCircle reported that Olympus Capital Asia Credit was raising a new fund that would have a larger allocation for Indian companies. At the time, VCCircle also reported that Olympus had marked the first close of this second fund.Meanwhile, the equity investment from OMERS will help Orion Credit Capital Asia strengthen its platform and accelerate its growth plans, it said in a statement.“Growing our investment footprint in Asia is a strategic priority for OMERS and this investment is an important initiative in achieving our goals,” said Ashish Goyal, OMERS capital markets Asia senior managing director.Rise of private creditThe spinoff of Orion Credit and the investment by OMERS also represents the continued rise in interest that private credit as an asset class is seeing from firms and limited partners.Factors such as firms switching from the non-banking financial company (NBFC) model to asset managers chasing the premiums offered by this instrument have played a part in this trend.OMERS, for example, is not the only Canadian pension fund to have invested in a private credit fund. In September, the Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan tied up with Edelweiss Alternate Asset Advisors Ltd for a private debt platform that aims to invest $350 million (about Rs 2,565 crore) in India.At the time, the two entities said the platform will focus on “performing and distressed private credit investment opportunities in the country”.In February 2020, Canadian pension fund Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec (CDPQ) and India’s Piramal Asset Management Pvt. Ltd jointly floated a private credit financing platform with a corpus of $300 million (about Rs 2,200 crore).Canada Pension Plan Investment Board also struck a private credit deal via a fund format by investing in Bain Capital and Piramal Group’s India Resurgence Fund near the end of 2019.Share article on",https://www.vccircle.com//orion-credit-spins-out-of-olympus-capital-secures-investment-from-omers,Merger/Acquisition,"""In December, the management team, which has spearheaded private credit efforts of Olympus Capital Asia since 2012, spun out from Olympus Capital Asia and rebranded the private credit business as Orion Capital Asia,"" it said in a statement.As part of this transition, Orion Credit Capital has secured an equity investment from OMERS (Ontario Municipal Employees Retirement System), a Canadian pension fund.In a statement, Orion Credit said it will focus on direct lending in the Asia-Pacific region and will manage investment vehicles that will provide medium-term secured loans to mid-market enterprises sponsored by PE firms and local entrepreneurs.The loans provided by these vehicles will help target companies finance their growth and acquisitions, with investments involving diverse sectors and bespoke solutions.The development comes nearly a year after VCCircle reported that Olympus Capital Asia Credit was raising a new fund that would have a larger allocation for Indian companies.At the time, VCCircle also reported that Olympus had marked the first close of this second fund.Meanwhile, the equity investment from OMERS will help Orion Credit Capital Asia strengthen its platform and accelerate its growth plans, it said in a statement.“Growing our investment footprint in Asia is a strategic priority for OMERS and this investment is an important initiative in achieving our goals,” said Ashish Goyal, OMERS capital markets Asia senior managing director.Rise of private creditThe spinoff of Orion Credit and the investment by OMERS also represents the continued rise in interest that private credit as an asset class is seeing from firms and limited partners.Factors such as firms switching from the non-banking financial company (NBFC) model to asset managers chasing the premiums offered by this instrument have played a part in this trend.OMERS, for example, is not the only Canadian pension fund to have invested in a private credit fund.","['Olympus Capital Asia', 'Olympus Capital Asia', 'Orion Capital Asia', 'Orion Credit Capital', 'Orion Credit', 'VCCircle', 'Olympus Capital Asia Credit', 'VCCircle', 'Olympus', 'OMERS', 'Orion Credit Capital Asia', 'OMERS', 'Orion Credit', 'OMERS']","['$350 million', '$300 million']"

"Nithia Capital, CarVal Investors complete acquisition of two Uttam Galva units",05 January,"Seven months after court approval, UK-based distressed steel investor Nithia Capital and American global alternative investment manager CarVal Investors have completed the acquisition of Uttam Galva Metallics Limited & Uttam Value Steel Limited.The purchase worth over Rs 2,000 crore (around $273 million) has been made through their Singapore-based joint venture holding company Wardha Steel Holdings Pte Ltd.Dr Johannes Sittard, chairman and founding member of Nithia Capital, has been appointed chairman of Wardha Steel, and Jai Saraf, founder and CEO of Nithia Capital, has been appointed chairman of both targets, Nithia Capital said in a statement.Both the steel players were on the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) second list of corporate defaulters referred for resolution under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC).Bankruptcy proceedings against the two units of Uttam Galva Steel were initiated in May (Uttam Value Steels) and July (Uttam Galva Metallics) 2018. The resolution professional had admitted claims of around Rs 4,176 crore of Uttam Galva Metallics and Rs 3,014 crore of Uttam Value Steels.The resolution application of CarVal Investors, an arm of US-based food and agriculture group Cargill Inc., and Nithia Capital was approved by the Committee of Creditors (CoC) in April 2019.The only other final bidder Hong Kong-based SSG Capital Management had challenged this approval.It was only after about a year that the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) approved the resolution plan by Nithia Capital and CarVal Investors.The plan involved upfront and contingent payment of Rs 1,078 crore for Uttam Value Steels and another Rs 1,576 crore for Uttam Metallics.Businessman Sajjan Jindal’s JSW Steel Ltd and the UK-based Liberty House had also earlier shown interest in bidding for both the assets but opted not to.For the year ended March 2020, Uttam Value Steels’ loss widened over 140% to Rs 308.6 crore ($42 million). Its net sales declined 20% to Rs 1,988.8 crore (271.7 million). Standalone debt as on March-end 2020 was Rs 1,443 crore ($197 million).The latest financials for Uttam Galva Metallics were not available.This week, it was reported that the two units’ former parent Uttam Galva Steel, which is also being resolved under bankruptcy, attracted interest from four steel companies — ArcelorMittal, JSW Steel, Jindal Steel & Power, and Vedanta-owned ESL Steel — and Phoenix Asset Reconstruction Company (ARC), owned by Kotak Group.Nithia Capital and CarVal Investors aim to increase the two units’ primary steel-making capacity by 50% in the immediate future by completing partially completed projects in a timely and cost-effective manner, the statement said.Saraf said, “Nithia Capital envisions to create a consolidated steel operating platform of up to two million tonnes of production per year in India through acquisition and organic growth. We have been looking at multiple steel acquisition opportunities in India over the last few years. We consider India to be the engine of growth for world steel for the next 20-25 years, and it is our intention to actively participate in this process.”Saraf confirmed this is Nithia Capital's first successful acquisition in India and ""we plan to further build on this success"".CarVal Investors is a global alternative investment manager with a total AUM (assets under management) of over $10 billion. It has over 30 years of global track record in opportunistic and distressed credit investment, having invested $113 billion in 5,320 transactions in 79 countries.Share article on",https://www.vccircle.com//nithia-capital-carval-investors-complete-acquisition-of-two-uttam-galva-units,Merger/Acquisition,"Seven months after court approval, UK-based distressed steel investor Nithia Capital and American global alternative investment manager CarVal Investors have completed the acquisition of Uttam Galva Metallics Limited & Uttam Value Steel Limited.The purchase worth over Rs 2,000 crore (around $273 million) has been made through their Singapore-based joint venture holding company Wardha Steel Holdings Pte Ltd.Dr Johannes Sittard, chairman and founding member of Nithia Capital, has been appointed chairman of Wardha Steel, and Jai Saraf, founder and CEO of Nithia Capital, has been appointed chairman of both targets, Nithia Capital said in a statement.Both the steel players were on the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) second list of corporate defaulters referred for resolution under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC).Bankruptcy proceedings against the two units of Uttam Galva Steel were initiated in May (Uttam Value Steels) and July (Uttam Galva Metallics) 2018.The resolution professional had admitted claims of around Rs 4,176 crore of Uttam Galva Metallics and Rs 3,014 crore of Uttam Value Steels.The resolution application of CarVal Investors, an arm of US-based food and agriculture group Cargill Inc., and Nithia Capital was approved by the Committee of Creditors (CoC) in April 2019.The only other final bidder Hong Kong-based SSG Capital Management had challenged this approval.It was only after about a year that the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) approved the resolution plan by Nithia Capital and CarVal Investors.The plan involved upfront and contingent payment of Rs 1,078 crore for Uttam Value Steels and another Rs 1,576 crore for Uttam Metallics.Businessman Sajjan Jindal’s JSW Steel Ltd and the UK-based Liberty House had also earlier shown interest in bidding for both the assets but opted not to.For the year ended March 2020, Uttam Value Steels’ loss widened over 140% to Rs 308.6 crore ($42 million).","['Nithia Capital', 'Uttam Galva Metallics Limited & Uttam Value Steel Limited', 'Wardha Steel Holdings Pte Ltd.', 'Nithia Capital', 'Wardha Steel', 'Nithia Capital', 'Nithia Capital', 'the Reserve Bank of India’s', 'RBI', 'the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code', 'Uttam Galva Steel', 'Uttam Value Steels', 'Uttam Galva Metallics', 'Uttam Galva Metallics', 'Uttam Value Steels', 'CarVal Investors', 'Cargill Inc.', 'Nithia Capital', 'the Committee of Creditors', 'SSG Capital Management', 'the National Company Law Tribunal', 'Nithia Capital', 'CarVal Investors', 'Uttam Value Steels', 'Uttam Metallics', 'JSW Steel Ltd', 'Liberty House', 'Uttam Value Steels']","['around $273 million', '$42 million', '197', 'over $10 billion', '$113 billion']"
Jaykay Enterprises forms metal-printing JV with German firm,04 January,"Jaykay Enterprises Ltd (JKEL), part of the JK conglomerate, has formed a joint venture with the Singapore unit of Germany-based metals and plastics industrial printing manufacturer EOS.The focus of this Bengaluru-based JV – NeuMesh Labs Pvt Ltd – will be to strengthen the two companies’ presence in the metal printing segment in the country, JKEL said in a statement.In a stock-exchange filing, JKEL said the JV with EOS Singapore Pte Ltd will see the two firms hold 70% and 30% stakes, respectively. Further, it said it is also aiming to invest in a print farm where infrastructure and assets will be owned by the company.This is not the first time JKEL has made a move in the 3D printing and manufacturing space in the country. In April 2018, it picked up a 27.65% stake in Nebula3D Services Pvt Ltd, which provides 3D printing-related applications including scanning, modelling, reverse engineering, and designing and benchmarking.“A huge component of the metal 3D market in our country remains unaddressed. Due to the ever-changing technology and limitation in the size and deposition rate in printing, companies are reluctant to invest in the technology,” JKEL additional director Abhishek Singhania said.The joint venture will address the need for printing applications required by sectors including defence, aerospace, and healthcare, he added. JKEL claims a study commissioned by it has found that the metal 3D printing market in India can grow to Rs 1,190 crore (approximately $162.96 million at current exchange rates) by 2025, at a compound annual growth rate of 33.2%.NeuMesh Labs will help customers adapt this technology through offering EOS’ solutions in areas including design for additive manufacturing, part screening and selection, and topology optimisation. The venture will look to secure both domestic and international clients.Shares of JKEL ended trading on Monday up 1.91% at Rs 10.69 apiece.

Japan's Kirin to invest $30 mn in craft beer maker Bira,04 January,"Japan's beer maker Kirin Holdings will invest $30 million (about Rs 220 crore) in New Delhi-based B9 Beverages, the companies said on Monday, as it seeks to secure a spot in India's growing craft beer market amid falling sales at home.The Japanese brewer will acquire a stake of under 10% in B9, the maker of India's popular craft beer Bira, a Kirin spokesman and Bira CEO Ankur Jain told Reuters. They declined to give further financial details.B9 had been in talks with international brewers - including Kirin - and other investors to sell a stake of up to 20% in the company, Reuters reported in August.The investment would allow Bira, which has posted losses in recent years and has been hit by the COVID-19 pandemic, to break even in the 2022 fiscal year which starts in April 2021, Jain said.""The companies will be exploring business synergies,"" Jain said, adding that the investment would allow Bira to accelerate plans to launch its products in Japan later this year.He expected the deal to be closed over ""the next few days"".While Bira, launched in 2015, is one of the smallest players in India's broader beer industry, its craft beer offerings have become increasingly popular in recent years. Bira says it has a 5-10% share of the beer market in cities such as New Delhi, Mumbai and Bengaluru.Kirin meanwhile has historically shown interest in independent breweries and owns a minority stake in New York's Brooklyn Brewery.But its M&A record overseas has been patchy, with the Japanese firm selling its unprofitable Brazilian unit in 2017 to Heineken after losing market share.Its entry into Myanmar in 2015 has also come under scrutiny amid a probe into its local partner's connections to the military.Data provider PitchBook estimates Bira was valued at $210 million in 2018.

Flashback 2020: Global M&As fall as fewer companies catch deal bug,31 December,"Global mergers and acquisitions (M&A) activity fell to a three-year low in 2020, as companies grappled with the financial fallout of the COVID-19 pandemic, even as dealmaking came roaring back in the second half.The value of M&A globally dropped 5% year-on-year to $3.6 trillion, the lowest since 2017, according to a preliminary tally from financial data provider Refinitiv. There were 48,226 deals announced, compared with 50,113 deals last year.Technology, healthcare and financial services deals led the recovery after M&A activity plunged in the second quarter on concerns about global economic prospects. A stock market rally and access to cheap financing gave chief executives confidence to pursue transformative transactions again.""The biggest story has to be the enormous rebound we have experienced. Talk about dog years, we went through a three-to-five year cycle in just six months,"" said Cary Kochman, Citigroup Inc's global co-head of M&A.Eight of the year's 10 biggest transactions were announced in the second half of the year. They included financial data provider S&P Global Inc's $44 billion purchase of IHS Markit Ltd, AstraZeneca Plc's $39 billion acquisition of U.S. drugmaker Alexion Pharmaceuticals Inc , and Salesforce.com Inc's $27.7 billion deal for workplace messaging app Slack Technologies Inc.Dealmakers see the recovery picking up steam in 2021, with companies, private equity firms and special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs) all eyeing acquisitions.""The world is still a volatile place but the foundations are in place for one of the largest M&A years to date,"" said Stephan Feldgoise, global co-head of M&A at Goldman Sachs Group Inc.M&A volume in the United States was down 23% at $1.4 trillion, accounting for close to 40% of global dealmaking. Europe took second spot with $989 billion in M&A activity, up 35%, while the Asia-Pacific region came third with $872 billion, up 15%.U.S. President-elect Joe Biden's administration is expected to adopt less protectionist policies and be less hostile to cross-border deals, including from China, some dealmakers said.""The change in U.S. administration may make people outside the U.S. feel more comfortable about investing in the United States,"" said Alan Klein, co-head of M&A at law firm Simpson Thacher.In Britain, Europe's most active M&A market, dealmakers shrugged off concerns over Brexit, with $302 billion in deals, up 50% year on year.""Brexit does present risks but London will continue to enjoy many underlying advantages. Dealmakers trust the British judicial system and takeover regime and there are deep networks of lawyers, accountants and advisers that are not immediately replicable elsewhere,"" said Alex Thomas, managing director for M&A in Europe at RBC Capital Markets.The key focus at the start of the year will be the U.S. Senate runoff elections on Jan. 5 in Georgia that will determine which party controls that chamber of Congress, and the fate of much of Biden's agenda, including proposed tax hikes.""Whatever the Georgia Senate election result is, increased certainty is a helpful catalyst for M&A,"" said Marco Caggiano, co-head of North America M&A at JPMorgan Chase & Co.More leveraged buyoutsPrivate equity firms capitalized on the plentiful financing available and stepped up leveraged buyouts, with their deals up 20% at $570 billion.""They have a substantial amount of money to be deployed but they are also ready to prune some portfolio assets, especially those that have benefited from the crisis and are ripe for an exit,"" said Berthold Fuerst, co-head of investment banking coverage and advisory in EMEA at Deutsche Bank.The strong stock market rally has also emboldened activist hedge funds, which are increasingly teaming up with buyout firms.""Until the end of the summer, there was simply no willingness by existing investors to back an activist campaign. Activism is coming back, as some funds want to use the market rebound to build new positions,"" said JPMorgan's global co-head of M&A Dirk Albersmeier.Bankers are predicting another active year for SPACs, which were one of 2020's most popular investment vehicles. SPACs are shell companies that raise money through IPOs with the aim of buying a private firm.More than 200 SPACs raised over $78 billion this year, more than six times the previous record year. With SPACs typically buying companies around five times the size of their IPO, there could be some $300 billion of M&A in 2021 and 2022 by SPACs, according to a Goldman Sachs report.""The comfort level and understanding of what it means to combine with a SPAC...is something that is driving many companies to consider a SPAC merger,"" said Kevin Brunner, co-head of U.S. M&A at Bank of America Corp.Share article on",https://www.vccircle.com//flashback-2020-global-m-as-fall-as-fewer-companies-catch-deal-bug,Merger/Acquisition,"""The world is still a volatile place but the foundations are in place for one of the largest M&A years to date,"" said Stephan Feldgoise, global co-head of M&A at Goldman Sachs Group Inc.M&A volume in the United States was down 23% at $1.4 trillion, accounting for close to 40% of global dealmaking.Dealmakers trust the British judicial system and takeover regime and there are deep networks of lawyers, accountants and advisers that are not immediately replicable elsewhere,"" said Alex Thomas, managing director for M&A in Europe at RBC Capital Markets.The key focus at the start of the year will be the U.S. Senate runoff elections on Jan. 5 in Georgia that will determine which party controls that chamber of Congress, and the fate of much of Biden's agenda, including proposed tax hikes.","['Goldman Sachs Group Inc.', 'RBC Capital Markets', 'U.S. Senate', 'Congress']","['$3.6 trillion', '$44 billion', '$39 billion', '$27.7 billion', '$1.4 trillion', '$989 billion', '$872 billion', '$302 billion', '$570 billion', 'over $78 billion', 'some $300 billion']"

Tata Sons to acquire AirAsia's stake in airline JV,29 December,"Tata Sons Pvt. Ltd, the holding company of the software-to-steel conglomerate, has signed a pact with Malaysian budget carrier AirAsia Group Bhd to increase its stake in their India joint venture.Tony Fernandes-led AirAsia said in a stock-exchange filing Tuesday it has agreed to sell a 32.67% stake in the joint venture for $37.66 million (about Rs 276.7 crore at current exchange rates).The Malaysia airline previously owned 49% of AirAsia (India) Ltd while Tata Sons controlled 51%.AirAsia said it will also have an option to divest its remaining 16.33% in the Indian venture to Tata Sons for $18.83 million. It can sell the stake in two stages in 2022.Similarly, Tata Sons will get an option to acquire AirAsia’s remaining stake at any time after the current transaction is completed. The deadline to close the deal is March 31, 2021.AirAsia has also agreed to waive unpaid brand licence fees payable by the India joint venture due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This waiver will not have any material effect on the company’s earnings or net assets, it said. The Malaysian airline, which shut its Japan operations two months ago, said the deal to exit the non-core Indian market would allow it to focus on its key markets of Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia and the Philippines.“Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, the aviation industry has been one of the hardest hit industries,” AirAsia said, adding that the company will regularly re-assess its business strategies and dispose of non-core investments.AirAsia India was formed in February 2013 with the Tata group initially owning a 30% stake, the Malaysian carrier controlling 49% and Arun Bhatia-controlled Telestra Tradeplace holding the rest.Tata Sons increased its stake to 41.06% in 2015 when Telestra opted not to subscribe to a rights issue of shares.

Credit Suisse's stake sale in PE-backed Prime Focus draws Reliance Capital's ire,28 December,"Businessman Anil Ambani-led Reliance Capital Ltd threatened on Monday to take legal and regulatory action to scuttle a stake sale by Credit Suisse in Prime Focus Ltd to the company’s promoters.Credit Suisse had agreed last week to sell a 33.12% stake in Prime Focus to the promoter group including Namit Malhotra. Subsequently, the promoters made an open offer to acquire another 26% of Prime Focus from the public shareholders, as per regulatory norms.However, Reliance Capital said in a statement the proposed sale was “a blatant abuse” of purported rights by Credit Suisse under certain lending agreements with the Anil Ambani group company.It also said that the proposed transaction was at a “substantial discount to the intrinsic value” of Prime Focus’s shares and that it violated several laws, rules and regulations.Credit Suisse had acquired Reliance Capital’s stake in Prime Focus by invoking a collateral against loans, according to the 2018-19 annual report of Reliance MediaWorks Ltd, the group’s media arm. The Swiss financial services giant is selling its stake to the promoters of Prime Focus for Rs 463 crore.The promoters made the open offer at a price of Rs 44.15 per share.
