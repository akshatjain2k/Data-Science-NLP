RBI to raise rates once more on April 6 but leave door open for more: Poll,29 March,"The Reserve Bank of India will raise its main interest rate by 25 basis points on April 6 and then pause for the rest of the year, according to a Reuters poll of economists who said the central bank would still maintain its tightening stance.

Inflation in Asia's third-largest economy remains above the central bank's upper tolerance limit of 6.00%, reaching 6.52% in January and easing only slightly to 6.44% in February, a key reason for the RBI to hike again.A strong majority of economists, 49 of 62, said the RBI would lift its repo rate by 25 basis points to a seven-year high of 6.75% at the conclusion of its April 3-6 meeting.A majority of economists in the March 23-28 Reuters poll also said the RBI would then keep the rate steady for the rest of the year.If realised, that would mark a cumulative 275 basis point increase from the Monetary Policy Committee since last May, a relatively modest rate cycle compared with some other central banks like the U.S. Federal Reserve, which started earlier.""It's not just headline - even core inflation, which the MPC did emphasize substantially in the last two policy reviews, continues to be a point of concern for them,"" said Vivek Kumar, an economist at QuantEco.""The Fed has done what it roughly telegraphed, and given that backdrop ... we see no reason why the RBI should stay back, especially when inflation is running ahead of the upper end of the comfort band.""A majority of respondents, 20 of 36, said the central bank would maintain its withdrawal of accommodation stance at the April meeting. The remaining 16 said it would shift to neutral.""We expect no change in the stance. There is still a residual expectation of one more Fed rate hike in May. Until that is behind us, the RBI probably will not be very comfortable in signalling that they are done with rate hikes,"" said QuantEco's Kumar.Of the 33 respondents who answered a separate question, just over half, 18, said the bigger risk to their terminal rate forecast was it would be higher than they predicted, while the remaining 15 said it was that it would be lower.In last month's poll, all economists said the bigger risk was it would be higher than they predicted.Seventeen economists who answered another question on how high the rate might go if 6.75% is not the peak gave a median forecast of 7.00%.""With inflation a persistent concern, (the) RBI will likely keep all its options open to deal with the near- and medium-term inflationary risks,"" noted Kaushik Das, chief economist, India and South Asia at Deutsche Bank.The survey showed inflation was expected to average 6.7% in the current fiscal year, and then fall to 5.2% in the next, remaining above the 4.0% medium-term target.The Indian economy was forecast to grow 6.9% this fiscal year and then slow to 6.0% in the next.

Reliance Capital's lenders to move ahead with second auction after SC nod,28 March,"The lenders of Reliance Capital have decided to go ahead with the second round of auction on 4 April, in accordance with the Supreme Court decision, despite the Hinduja group retracting its revised bid, according to three people aware of the matter.The Hinduja group submitted a revised bid of ₹9,000 crore on 21 December, a day after the first round of auction—in which rival Torrent Group had been declared the highest bidder—concluded. Torrent had bid for ₹8,640 crore, while Hinduja Group had originally offered ₹8,110 crore. Challenging this, Torrent approached the National Company Law Tribunal, which asked the lenders to keep the Hinduja Group’s post-auction offer on hold till final hearing.But an appeals court overturned the order . Torrent then approached the Supreme Court to seek a stay on the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal order, but the apex court ruled in favour of lenders, allowing them to hold a second round of auctions.But in a surprise twist, the Hinduja group told lenders at an informal meeting last week that it wants to revert to the old offer of ₹8,110 crore.A banker, one of the three people cited above, said that the existing bidders, including Torrent Investments and Hinduja Group, will have to enhance the bids submitted in the first round. However, the committee of creditors (CoC) has not set a reserve price for the auction, the banker said.While the CoC can go ahead with the second round of the challenge mechanism, the outcome of the auction will be subject to the final decision of the Supreme Court.“It is learnt that Hinduja Group told the lenders that it will participate in the auction.

Artha India Ventures backs Kenya's BuuPass in third African bet,28 March,"Artha India Ventures, the alternative investment arm of the family office of Ashok Kumar Damani, has backed Kenya-based mobility marketplace BuuPass, marking its third bet in the African continent. The Mumbai-based early-stage investor’s infusion into BuuPass is a part of its $1.30 million pre-seed funding round led by Founders Factory Africa. The fundraise also saw participation from Google Black Founders Fund, Gullit VC, Five35 VC, FrontEnd Ventures and Adaverse, Renew Capital among others. This is the first institutional round raised by BuuPass, which had earlier bagged $1 million in grants from Bill Clinton-backed Hult Prize. The fresh proceeds will be deployed to expand into East African markets with a special focus to Kenya and Uganda.  “This funding will enable us to expand our footprint in Kenya and Uganda. Our goal is to create a comprehensive continent-wide network of interconnected transport that make travelling hassle-free for all,” said Sonia Kabra, cofounder and co-chief executive officer (CEO) at BuuPass.  Founded in 2016 by Kabra and Wyclife Omondi, BuuPass provides fleet owners with a full-stack bus management system for managing their operations, inventory, and sales.

It claims to help customers to search, compare and book their tickets across different channels.  BuuPass further claims to have over 1,200 vehicles registered on its platform from over 25 bus companies. It is the sole technology provider for online railway ticket booking in Kenya and generated a GMV (gross merchandise value) of $30 million in 2022. It claims to be currently processing around 12,000 transactions daily. “Our bus operators have seen a significant decrease in cash leakages and increased revenue from online bookings. 80% of our clients come through referrals, demonstrating that our focus on customer satisfaction is yielding fruit. We can customize the technology for most businesses, and give on-demand support,” said Omondi co-CEO, BuuPass.   Artha India Ventures’ director Anirudh A Damani said that the African continent is fast emerging as a startup innovation hotbed and that the ecosystem is churning out many disruptive, unique investment opportunities.  Established in 2012, the investment arm has a diverse portfolio which includes renewables, leasing, and institutional funds.

How debt fund taxation changes may weaken corporate bond demand,27 March,"India's decision to take away long term tax benefits for debt mutual funds is likely to weaken demand for longer duration corporate bonds, eventually leading to higher costs of raising funds, mutual fund investors said on Monday.The country amended a bill last week to tax investments in debt mutual funds as short-term capital gains, a move that could strip investors of the long-term tax benefits that made such investments popular.""Demand for above three-year corporate bonds would be impacted, and we could see some steepening of the curve right from one-year to five-year point, and spreads with government bond yields could see 10 basis points of widening"" said Raju Sharma, head fixed income at IDBI Mutual fund.The changes have taken away the long-term tax advantage these funds had over bank deposits and are likely to push money away from most debt mutual fund products, including corporate bond funds, the investors said.""Corporate bond products like target maturity funds, actively managed fixed income and other funds which are not (used for) cash management will be impacted,"" said Radhika Gupta, managing director & chief executive officer at Edelweiss AMC.Indian companies had outstanding corporate bonds worth around 41 trillion rupees ($497.69 billion) as on December 2022, while mutual funds held around 4.4 trillion rupees of corporate debt, as on February, according to Securities and Exchange Board of India.Though mutual holdings may be comparatively smaller to other long-term investors - mostly banks, insurance companies and pension funds, they trade more actively and provide liquidity to the market.""The decision may severely hamper the corporate bond market liquidity... With reduced investment in both passive and active debt MF, the depth and breadth of corporate bonds looks doubtful,"" said Sandeep Yadav, senior vice president, head fixed income at DSP Mutual Fund.Fund managers expect mutual funds to focus more on actively managed funds which can allow for higher returns and balance out the impact of higher taxes.""Active funds is something where energies would be diverted from fund management's perspective,"" said a Mumbai-based fund manager.Managers also said that post the amendment, inflows in equities will rise, which could also dampen demand for debt funds.""People will invest in schemes with more allocation for equities.

How banking turmoil is taking leverage out of private equity buyouts,24 March,"Private equity firms that acquired companies since the banking crisis started on March 8 have funded the deals mostly with their own funds, a departure from traditional leveraged buyouts that reflects their struggle to secure cheap debt.Four acquisitions of companies by private equity firms that were announced in the last two weeks were funded by debt that accounted for between 9% and 50% of the deal consideration, according to a Reuters review of regulatory filings. The remainder was equity checks by the private equity firms.Typically, debt accounts for between 60% and 80% of the deal consideration, allowing the buyout firms to juice returns.Private equity executives and their advisers say the shift towards more equity financing started before the turmoil in the banking sector this month, as the rise in interest rates over the course of the last year made debt more expensive, and fears about an economic slowdown made lenders more risk-averse.Yet this trend picked up steam after three U.S. banks collapsed this month and concerns over the banking sector's resilience forced many lenders to retrench, they added.
""Private equity investors are having to pick their spots and need to have very strong conviction to be able to get a deal done,"" said Rob Pulford, partner and head of the financial and strategic investors group at Goldman Sachs Group Inc.When Blackstone Group Inc clinched the $4.6 billion acquisition of U.S. cloud-based event-software provider Cvent Holding Corp from Vista Equity Partners on March 14, it only borrowed $1 billion for the deal. The rest came from Blackstone, the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, and Vista, which rolled over a portion of its stake in Cvent.In similar fashion, Silver Lake and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board agreed on March 12 to buy data analytics firm Qualtrics International Inc for $12.5 billion by using only $1 billion in debt.Apollo Global Management Inc signed an $8.1 billion agreement to acquire specialty chemicals distributor Univar Solutions Inc on March 14 by using debt for only half the deal consideration.Symphony Technology Group agreed on March 13 to acquire Momentive Global Inc, the owner of online survey vendor SurveyMonkey, for $1.5 billion while using only $450 million in debt.Six private equity firms polled by Reuters said they had not adjusted down their typical 20% annualized return expectations in light of the tough debt financing environment.They requested anonymity because such figures are kept confidential between the firms and their investors.Bob Rivollier, a private equity partner at law firm Ropes & Gray, said that many buyout firms that rely heavily on equity financing believe it's possible to achieve the returns they have seen in the past by adding debt to the companies they buy down the road. This has made return assumptions on these deals more precarious, he added.""Equity isn't cheap. Between a deal where 40 percent is equity and 60 percent is debt and one where 100 percent is equity, you're going to need a much higher return for the equity deal to get the same overall return to your investors,"" Rivollier said.Refinancing riskTo be sure, a handful of private equity firms have already been accustomed to this kind of refinancing risk. Vista and Thoma Bravo are among the private equity firms that in the last 12 months have been buying companies with mostly equity financing with plans to add debt to them later. They do this to avoid lengthy negotiations with lenders while they hurry to clinch deals with sellers.An upside to the shift toward equity financing, dealmakers say, is that the companies owned by the private equity firms have more cushion to absorb losses if their business deteriorates. Many of the leveraged buyouts that became bankruptcies in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis were the result of private equity firms saddling companies with debt to the hilt.Jonathan Rouner, vice chairman of investment banking at Nomura Securities, said private equity firms reserved the option when to add more debt to their companies when it's possible and safe to do so.""You fund the investment with equity and, when financing markets recover, do a large financing to take your equity back out,"" Rouner said.Share article on",https://www.vccircle.com//howbanking-turmoil-is-taking-leverage-out-of-private-equity-buyouts,Finance,"The remainder was equity checks by the private equity firms.Typically, debt accounts for between 60% and 80% of the deal consideration, allowing the buyout firms to juice returns.Private equity executives and their advisers say the shift towards more equity financing started before the turmoil in the banking sector this month, as the rise in interest rates over the course of the last year made debt more expensive, and fears about an economic slowdown made lenders more risk-averse.Yet this trend picked up steam after three U.S. banks collapsed this month and concerns over the banking sector's resilience forced many lenders to retrench, they added.The rest came from Blackstone, the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, and Vista, which rolled over a portion of its stake in Cvent.In similar fashion, Silver Lake and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board agreed on March 12 to buy data analytics firm Qualtrics International Inc for $12.5 billion by using only $1 billion in debt.Apollo Global Management Inc signed an $8.1 billion agreement to acquire specialty chemicals distributor Univar Solutions Inc on March 14 by using debt for only half the deal consideration.Symphony Technology Group agreed on March 13 to acquire Momentive Global Inc, the owner of online survey vendor SurveyMonkey, for $1.5 billion while using only $450 million in debt.Six private equity firms polled by Reuters said they had not adjusted down their typical 20% annualized return expectations in light of the tough debt financing environment.They requested anonymity because such figures are kept confidential between the firms and their investors.Bob Rivollier, a private equity partner at law firm Ropes & Gray, said that many buyout firms that rely heavily on equity financing believe it's possible to achieve the returns they have seen in the past by adding debt to the companies they buy down the road.","['Blackstone', 'the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority', 'Vista', 'the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board', 'Qualtrics International Inc', 'Apollo Global Management Inc', 'Univar Solutions Inc', 'Symphony Technology Group', 'Momentive Global Inc', 'SurveyMonkey', 'Reuters', 'Ropes & Gray']","['$4.6 billion', '$1 billion', '$12.5 billion', 'only $1 billion', '$8.1 billion', '$1.5 billion', 'only $450 million']"
Why dealmakers expect M&A activity to pick up despite facing 'brick wall',24 March,"Some of the most prominent rainmakers in the world of corporate mergers struck a note of optimism about dealmaking on Thursday, even as they acknowledged a volatile economic backdrop had significantly impacted M&A activity.The banking crisis that has emerged in the wake of Silicon Valley Bank's failure has shaken boardroom confidence already dented by fears over an economic slowdown, investment bankers and deal lawyers told the Tulane Corporate Law Institute conference in New Orleans.""There is a brick wall in front of M&A activity,"" said Anu Aiyengar, global head of M&A at JPMorgan Chase & Co.""When you look at what's happening in China, geopolitical tensions, interest rates, bank runs, liquidity crisis, increased chances of recession - throw everything together and it seems quite formidable.""With financing having dried up for private equity-backed leveraged buyouts, buyers will have no option but to put up a lot of equity to get deals done in the near term, the conference participants said.""We are in for choppiness,"" said Scott Barshay, chair of the corporate department at law firm Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP. ""There is a giant struggle right now. And it's a giant struggle because there's a lot of dry powder for the equity part of private equity deals. What there's not is a lot of leverage for the leverage part of the leveraged buyout.""M&A volumes declined considerably last year amid fears of faster interest rate hikes, possible recession, weaker credit markets and a tumbling stock market.The total value of deals last year fell 37% from a record high in 2021 to $3.61 trillion, according to Refinitiv data. That is the biggest year-over-year percentage drop since 2001 when the U.S. economy fell into recession.Global dealmaking this year through mid-March has tumbled nearly 50% in terms of dollar volumes from a year ago and is off nearly 30% in terms of the number of deals being done, according to Refinitiv.Dealmakers, however, said they expect the impact from the banking crisis on broader M&A activity to be contained, as most of the worst affected regional banks are not major advisers or lenders on deals.The technology sector remains the best hunting ground for corporate acquirers or private equity financiers, deal advisors said.""There is really no part of the world that allows you to have an organic growth trajectory that lets you meet the market possible for trading at a premium valuation, which means you have to look at inorganic growth opportunities,"" said Aiyengar.Dealmakers also predicted an increase in unsolicited approaches from cash-flush buyers who are taking advantage of a drop in valuations of potential targets, who are now more willing to entertain bids than they were a few months ago.Increased regulatory uncertainty due to greater scrutiny on deals from antitrust regulators also is likely to impede the speed of deals getting across the finish line, with dealmakers criticizing the adversarial stance taken by the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice.""In this very narrow context of who's going to be running the DOJ antitrust division and the FTC in the future, our business will be a lot better if it's somebody else,"" said Barshay.Share article on",https://www.vccircle.com//whydealmakersexpect-m-a-activity-to-pick-up-despite-facing-brick-wall,Finance,"That is the biggest year-over-year percentage drop since 2001 when the U.S. economy fell into recession.Global dealmaking this year through mid-March has tumbled nearly 50% in terms of dollar volumes from a year ago and is off nearly 30% in terms of the number of deals being done, according to Refinitiv.Dealmakers, however, said they expect the impact from the banking crisis on broader M&A activity to be contained, as most of the worst affected regional banks are not major advisers or lenders on deals.The technology sector remains the best hunting ground for corporate acquirers or private equity financiers, deal advisors said.""There is really no part of the world that allows you to have an organic growth trajectory that lets you meet the market possible for trading at a premium valuation, which means you have to look at inorganic growth opportunities,"" said Aiyengar.Dealmakers also predicted an increase in unsolicited approaches from cash-flush buyers who are taking advantage of a drop in valuations of potential targets, who are now more willing to entertain bids than they were a few months ago.Increased regulatory uncertainty due to greater scrutiny on deals from antitrust regulators also is likely to impede the speed of deals getting across the finish line, with dealmakers criticizing the adversarial stance taken by the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice.","['Refinitiv', 'Aiyengar', 'the Federal Trade Commission', 'the Department of Justice']",['$3.61 trillion']

Govt seeks data on PSU banks' bond portfolios amid global banking turmoil,23 March,"India has asked state-owned lenders to submit details of their bond portfolios ahead of a quarterly meeting between the government and banks this Saturday, amid the turmoil in global banks, seven bankers with direct knowledge of the matters told Reuters on Thursday.""The finance ministry has asked banks to submit data about their held-to-maturity (HTM) portfolios and mark-to-market (MTM) losses in trading books to identify any potential stress,"" one senior banker said on condition of anonymity.The data collection process has been going on for the last few days and is more of a precautionary exercise because the government ""does not want to be caught off-guard"" if the crisis spirals further, the banker added.It was not immediately clear when the last check was done. However, the government or the Reserve Bank of India typically asks for such data during bouts of volatility.The bankers did not want to be named as they are not authorised to speak to the media. The Ministry of Finance did not respond to a Reuters email seeking comment.HTM investments are securities that banks purchase and intend to hold until they mature. Typically, government bonds are the most common form of such investments.These HTM investments account for 60% of banks' investment books, of which government securities form around 95%, according to a Macquarie report.
Following the collapse of some U.S. regional banks, there have been concerns about lenders globally having to field possible losses in their HTM portfolio.
Indian bankers said they currently do not foresee any large MTM losses because they have strong capital levels and the rise in government bond yields has been gradual.India's 10-year benchmark bond yield has risen 50 basis points (bps) so far this financial year, during which the Reserve Bank of India has raised the policy repo rate by 250 bps. Most market participants expect the RBI to raise rates by 25 bps, to 6.75%, at its next policy meeting in April.""Though there is nothing to worry about banks' bond holdings, the government is likely to discuss the same after asking for data from banks,"" said another senior treasury official at a state-run bank.""It is just to check the stability of state-run banks.""Most analysts believe that Indian banks are not facing the same level of pressure on their bond portfolios as U.S. banks.""Unless there is a run on banks and they face enormous liquidity issues, the need to sell HTM book is low,"" Suresh Ganapathy, head of Macquarie Capital's financial research, said in a note.And since Indian banks' HTM book comprises high-quality government securities, the MTM losses are unlikely to be to the same extent as for global banks, Ganapathy added.While Indian banks have cleaned up their balance sheets in the past few years, Capital Economics said some vulnerabilities lurk.A high ratio of non-performing loans and low regulatory capital are causes for concern, Shilan Shah, deputy chief emerging markets economist at Capital Economics, wrote in a note this week.""The loss absorption capacity – the loan loss rate needed to reduce the tier 1 capital ratio below the regulatory minimum of 4.5% – is lower in India than in other EMs.""

"Distressed debt funds, hedge funds eye opportunities in Credit Suisse AT1 bonds",22 March,"Distressed debt investors and large hedge funds are buying up Credit Suisse additional tier-1 bonds at rock-bottom prices after they were written down to zero in the Swiss bank's rescue by cross-town rival UBS.Under the UBS deal, the Swiss regulator determined that Credit Suisse's AT1 bonds with a notional value of 16 billion Swiss francs ($17.35 billion) would be wiped out, a decision that stunned global credit markets and angered many holders of the debt, who believed they would be better protected than shareholders.AT1 bonds, which can convert to equity, rank higher than shares in the capital structure of a bank. If a bank runs into trouble, bondholders will usually come before shareholders in terms of getting their money back.AT1 bonds issued by other European banks tumbled on Monday as the treatment of Credit Suisse AT1 bondholders highlighted the risks of this type of debt.The bonds, now trading at about 0.03 cents on the dollar, have become an opportunity for hedge funds, which are taking punts that the merger of UBS/Credit Suisse might not proceed or that the Swiss regulator might even reverse its decision, six traders and dealmakers said.Robert Southey, a broker at Southey Capital in London, said bonds worth several hundred millions dollars in face value had traded since Sunday afternoon, mainly between large U.S. investors, (referring to the nominal value of the bonds).As the bonds are publicly traded, opportunistic buyers can hoover them up from funds and private banks looking to offload, said Southey.Buyers have included a mixture of hedge funds and deep distressed debt funds, which Southey expected would need to hold the bonds for an extended period before they paid off.Some of those buyers intend to join groups that would litigate to improve odds on cashing in on the bonds, Southey said.

How resilient are Indian lenders amid a global banking turmoil?,20 March,"Turbulence in the United States and the European banking sectors has prompted Indian policymakers to assure investors that the domestic financial institutions are resilient.Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Central Bank Governor Shaktikanta Das have both said that local lenders are strong, after the U.S. banking crisis spilled over to the Indian stock market and rattled bank stocks.The Nifty Bank index is down 5.3% since the crisis at Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) erupted earlier this month, compared with a near-18% fall in the U.S. banking index.However, analysts say that unlike in the past few years, when Indian banks had large bad loans and limited capital, these lenders are now in a better position to withstand stress.""Right now, Indian banks are showing resilience compared to their U.S. counterparts and that largely has to do with their current capital levels, healthy asset quality and strict monitoring by the regulator,"" said Anil Gupta, senior vice president and co-group head for financial sector ratings at ICRA ratings agency. He does not foresee a direct impact of the global banking turmoil on Indian banks.How well capitalised are Indian banks?The Indian financial sector has seen large insolvencies, including Yes Bank, over the past three years but lenders have reduced bad debt and raised capital since then, putting them in a stronger position.Stress tests conducted by the central bank and released as part of the Financial Stability Report (FSR) in December showed that Indian banks would be able to comply with the minimum capital requirements even under adverse scenarios.According to Reserve Bank of India (RBI) norms, banks are required to maintain a minimum Capital to Risk Weighted Assets Ratio (CRAR) of 9% on an ongoing basis.As per latest RBI data released in December, the CRAR and Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio of Indian banks stood at 16% and 13%, respectively, as of September-end.What is the asset quality position of banks?The gross non-performing assets to total advances ratio for Indian banks has been on a declining trend since hitting a high of 10.8% in September 2018. It fell from 5.9% in March 2022 to 5% in September 2022.The provision coverage ratio (PCR), which reflects the percentage of funds set aside for bad loans, has also been increasing since March 2021 to 71.5% as on September-end.How are Indian banks' bond portfolios performing?One of the pressures faced by U.S. banks is the sharp rise in interest rates, leading to mark-to-market losses on their bond portfolios.Indian banks are not facing the same level of pressure on their bond portfolios as U.S banks because Indian interest rates have risen less.While the Federal Reserve has raised interest rates by 450 basis points since March last year, India's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) has increased the policy repo rate by 250 bps since May.India's benchmark 10-year bond yield has risen 20 basis points since the rate hiking cycle began in May 2022, while the comparable U.S. 10-year yield has risen 150 bps since the Federal Reserve started hiking rates.If Indian banks mark their held-to-maturity (HTM) investments to market, it would bring down their CET-1 capital by 12-25%, estimates Moody's Investors Service. ""That said, banks are unlikely to realize such losses because their funding and liquidity are strong enough to allow them to hold onto their HTM securities,"" Moody's said in a report How comfortable are banks on liquidity?Indian banks have a high proportion of low-cost current account savings account (CASA) deposits and high proportion of retail deposits, making them more resilient, said Aditya Acharekar, associate director at CareEdge Ratings.While deposit growth has trailed credit growth in recent times, the credit-to-deposit (CD) ratio remains comfortable at 75.3%.This means that the banking system has sufficient stable funding.Indian banks are also comfortable on liquidity, with the coverage ratio at 135.6% as of September-end, latest central bank data showed, well above the regulatory requirement of 100%.Higher deposit insuranceAfter two large bank failures in the last three years, India has raised the limit of insurance cover for depositors in insured banks from the earlier level of 100,000 rupees ($1,211.23) to 500,000 per account.This was done with a view to providing a greater measure of protection to depositors in banks.While the amount seems small, it fully insures 98% of deposit accounts, according to a State Bank of India (SBI) research note.

"Hedge funds, big investors brace for more turmoil as banking drama unfolds",20 March,"Hedge funds managers and other large investors believe it is far too soon to call an all-clear on turmoil in the global financial sector even after more than a week of financial lifelines, central bank assurances and a massive banking rescue deal.In the past two weeks, two U.S. banks have collapsed, America's biggest lenders agreed to deposit $30 billion in another ailing firm, First Republic Bank, Credit Suisse Group AG needed a lifeline and at the end of a frenetic weekend agreed to be taken over by UBS.Michael A. Rosen, chief investment officer of Santa Monica-based adviser Angeles Investments, said the UBS-Credit Suisse deal eliminated one potential source of instability, but fundamental problems in the banking system remained, mainly tight monetary policy.""So maybe one hole in the wall has been plugged, but the water's rising,"" he said.One hedge fund manager described trades in the financial sector as being ""all over the map"", with nobody agreeing on anything.Some breathed a sigh of relief that a competitor stepped in with a rescue offer for Credit Suisse. Others worried that the $3.2 billion UBS will pay is far less than the $9.5 billion Credit Suisse was valued at on Friday, and one investor said the market may not consider this to be a positive.Many of the roughly one dozen managers contacted on Sunday asked not to be identified because their firms prohibit them from discussing their trades with the media, or they did not want to make their views and positions public.Others tweeted throughout the day.Daniel Loeb, chief investment officer of U.S. hedge fund firm Third Point LLC, wrote on Sunday morning that initial news of the UBS offer for Credit Suisse would be ""positive for financial system as it preserves the capital structure.""Later, short seller Jim Chanos tweeted his shock that $17 billion of Credit Suisse bonds would be wiped out, asking ""What are the Swiss doing here…?!""Chanos and Loeb did not respond to emails seeking further comment.There was also little agreement on how investors would be positioning themselves in smaller U.S. banks, including First Republic.First Republic's stock price tumbled 33% on Friday, one day after a handful of the country's largest banks, including JPMorgan Chase JPM.N, organized a $30 billion rescue package that was supported by the Federal Reserve and U.S. Treasury.On Sunday, credit rating agency S&P Global downgraded First Republic's ratings for the second time in less than a week, lowering its sovereign credit ratings to ""B+"" from ""BB+"". S&P maintained its outlook at ""Creditwatch Negative.""""The situation is not resolving easily,"" said one investor who allocates wealthy clients' capital with hedge funds.Several fund managers said it felt dangerous to bet on further declines in light of the rescue package, noting that retail investors could band together and support banks likeFirst Republic that were seen as solid enterprises. ""This name could easily go meme stock, so there is a fear of being short here,"" one manager said.Investors' short interest in First Republic was at $190 million, or about 3% of its float, according to data tweeted on Friday by research firm S3 Partners, which said short-sellers had made mark-to-market profits of $537 million on the trade this year and $62 million on Friday alone.Several investors also said they expect federal regulators to impose new rules for regional banks by tightening lending standards or forcing them to raise capital. With more regulatory pressure ahead, some said that buying stock in these banks after steep price declines might be a tougher call, because their lending activity could shrink.Investor Ricky Sandler, who runs hedge fund Eminence Capital LP, speculated on Twitter on Friday that an investment bank might be interested in First Republic, which caters to wealthy clients.
Sandler did not respond to a request for additional comment on Sunday.

The $54 bn olive branch for Credit Suisse that soothed investor nerves,16 March,"Credit Suisse said on Thursday it would borrow up to $54billion from Switzerland's central bank to shore up liquidity and investor confidence, after a slump in its shares had intensified fears about a global banking crisis.The bank's announcement, which came in the middle of the night in Zurich, prompted a 24% rise in Credit Suisse shares and helped reverse some of the heavy losses on stock markets driven by investor fears over potential bank runs across the world.Credit Suisse is the first major global bank to be thrown an emergency lifeline since the 2008 financial crisis and its troubles have raised serious doubts over whether central banks will be able to sustain their fight against inflation with aggressive interest rate hikes.Switzerland's second-largest bank said it would exercise an option to borrow up to 50 billion Swiss francs ($54 billion) from the central bank.That followed assurances from Swiss authorities on Wednesday that Credit Suisse met ""the capital and liquidity requirements imposed on systemically important banks"" and that it could access central bank liquidity if needed.JP Morgan analysts said that the measures will buy the Swiss lender time to carry out its restructuring.""The combination of measures should be sufficient to stem the negative moves across the capital structure as the market priced in the potential impact of liquidity pressures,"" JP Morgan said in a note on Thursday.While its shares bounced back, the cost of insuring exposure to Credit Suisse debt tumbled. Five-year credit default swaps were down 128 basis points to 1,016 bps from Wednesday's close after hitting record highs that day.The European banking index <.SX7P) was up 2.4% following the dramatic Swiss intervention, with big bank stocks rising and insurance protection on bonds issued by BNP Paribas BNPP.PA, Deutsche Bank DBKGn.DE and UBS also edging back down.Throughout most of the Asian day, stocks had wallowed in the red as investors rushed to the relative ""safe havens"" of gold, bonds and the dollar. While Credit Suisse's announcement helped trim some losses, trade was volatile and sentiment fragile.The head of Japan's banking lobby said that there were no signs at the moment of the Japanese financial system being affected by a crisis of confidence in Credit Suisse, as Japanese banks are well-capitalised.Credit Suisse's borrowing will be made under the covered loan facility and a short-term liquidity facility, fully collateralised by high quality assets. It also announced offers for senior debt securities for cash of up to 3 billion francs.Chief Executive Ulrich Koerner told Credit Suisse staff in a memo they should focus on facts as he pledged to rapidly move forward with a plan to streamline operations.Credit Suisse would continue to focus on the transformation from a position of strength, citing an improved liquidity coverage ratio and recent capital raisings, Koerner said.Meanwhile, Credit Suisse bankers in Asia contacted clients to reassure them after the latest inflow of funds.""We've been telling them to read the statements and look at the fact that we are buying 3 billion francs worth of bonds because they are so cheap,"" said a Hong Kong-based senior banker, who declined to be named.European epicentreThe 167-year-old bank's problems have shifted the focus for investors and regulators from the United States to Europe, where Credit Suisse led a selloff in bank shares after its largest investor said it could not provide more financial assistance because of regulatory constraints.The concerns about Credit Suisse added to broader banking sector fears sparked by last week's collapse of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) SIVB.O and Signature Bank, two U.S. mid-size firms.Investor focus is also on any action by central banks and other regulators elsewhere to restore confidence.Policymakers in Australia and South Korea sought to reassure markets that banks in their jurisdictions were well-capitalised.SVB's demise last week, followed by that of Signature Bank two days later, sent bank stocks on a roller-coaster ride as investors feared another collapse like Lehman Brothers, the Wall Street giant whose failure sparked the global financial crisis.On Wednesday, Credit Suisse shares led a 7% fall in the European banking index .SX7P.The exit for the doors raised fears of a broader threat to the financial system, and two supervisory sources told Reuters that the European Central Bank had contacted banks on its watch to quiz them about their Credit Suisse exposures.The U.S. Treasury also said it was monitoring the situation around Credit Suisse and was in touch with global counterparts.Next stepsRapidly rising interest rates have made it harder for some businesses to pay back or service loans, increasing the chances of losses for lenders already worried about a recession.Traders are now betting that the Federal Reserve, which last week was expected to accelerate its interest rate hikes in the face of persistent inflation, may hit pause or reverse course.Bets on a large ECB interest rate hike at Thursday's meeting also evaporated quickly.

"SVB fallout to weigh on banks, PE firms turning to peers for debt: Bain Capital's Connaughton",16 March,"Bain Capital's co-managing partner, John Connaughton, told Reuters on Wednesday that the fallout from SVB Financial Group's collapse will weigh on banks that have already retrenched from lending.Connaughton said private equity firms like Bain have been turning to peers with direct lending arms to secure debt for deals because traditional bank financing has become scarcer as banks adjust to the quick rise in interest rates. This is despite debt from direct lenders being significantly more expensive than bank financing.While the banking sector is strong enough to withstand SVB's failure, the lender's collapse will add to the caution that banks have been showing, Connaughton said in a Reuters Newsmaker interview.""The questions that are getting raised about Silicon Valley Bank are, 'Where is the liability and asset matching ... Where does that all sit and what liquidity concerns are out there?'"" Connaughton said.Connaughton said the cost of typical debt financing for private equity firms doing deals had jumped from between 5% and 6% to between 8% and 10%, while equity checks had also jumped.He added that Bain's return expectations on deals remained the same, partly because earnings at its portfolio of companies grew by 15% last year.""Unlike the public market, which increasingly paid a higher and higher price, we did pay some higher prices, but when we underwrote a deal, we underwrote it to a five-year plan where exit multiples will normalize,"" Connaughton said.Founded in 1984, Boston-based Bain Capital has grown into one of the world's largest investment firms with more than $160 billion in assets under management spread across private equity, credit, real estate, venture capital, life sciences and cryptocurrency and blockchain investments.Share article on",https://www.vccircle.com//svbfallout-to-weigh-on-banks-pe-firms-turning-to-peers-for-debt-bain-capital-s-connaughton,Finance,"Bain Capital's co-managing partner, John Connaughton, told Reuters on Wednesday that the fallout from SVB Financial Group's collapse will weigh on banks that have already retrenched from lending.Connaughton said private equity firms like Bain have been turning to peers with direct lending arms to secure debt for deals because traditional bank financing has become scarcer as banks adjust to the quick rise in interest rates.""Unlike the public market, which increasingly paid a higher and higher price, we did pay some higher prices, but when we underwrote a deal, we underwrote it to a five-year plan where exit multiples will normalize,"" Connaughton said.Founded in 1984, Boston-based Bain Capital has grown into one of the world's largest investment firms with more than $160 billion in assets under management spread across private equity, credit, real estate, venture capital, life sciences and cryptocurrency and blockchain investments.Share article on","[""Bain Capital's"", 'Reuters', ""SVB Financial Group's"", 'Bain', 'Bain Capital']",['more than $160 billion']

"India allows foreign law firms to practice in M&As, other select fields",15 March,"In a significant move that can open up cross-border deal pipelines for global law firms, the Bar Council of India (BCI) on Wednesday allowed foreign lawyers and law firms to practice in India.This would include matters relating to foreign law and diverse international law and international arbitration matters in India, on a reciprocity basis, the note from the BCI said.  Until now, cross-border transactions including M&As, fund raises from global investors and Indian companies expanding overseas used the services of these firms through their local tie-ups in India.  “With India’s economic rise, the quantum of cross-border transactions being conducted by Indian companies is slated to increase. Successful negotiations hinge on the availability of timely and cost-effective advice on matters of foreign law, which this move shall aid,” said Amit Singh, managing director and co-head, enterprise technology and services investment banking, Avendus Capital. The announcement comes five years after the Supreme Court (SC) reaffirmed the previous position of foreign lawyers practicing in India in the case of Bar Council of India Vs. A. K. Balaji and Ors. wherein the apex court restricted foreign law firms and lawyers from practicing in India. The judgment however permitted such firms/lawyers to visit India on a casual or temporary basis to render legal advice regarding foreign law, since it would not be covered as ""practice"" under the Advocates Act, 1961. The BCI now intends to help the legal profession grow in India to the benefit of lawyers. It is important to note, however, that the rules do not permit foreign lawyers/law firms to appear before any courts, tribunals, or other statutory or regulatory authorities. As per the rules, foreign lawyers/law firms are permitted to only engage in non-litigious matters such as transactional work (joint ventures, mergers and acquisitions), intellectual property matters, drafting of contracts and other related matters on a reciprocal basis. Historically, there has been a pushback from the domestic legal fraternity due to a lack of a level-playing field with their foreign counterparts.  “The resistance from the legal fraternity existed due to the differences in structures and rules applicable for practicing law in India as compared to foreign jurisdictions which didn’t offer a level playing field for Indian lawyers,” said Yashojit Mitra, partner at Economic Laws Practice (ELP), a homegrown law firm.However, this move might open up doors for Indian firms to also tap into an increasing pool of cross-border work.  “This would be a great opportunity for domestic law firms in terms of collaboration with international firms and an influx of global talent which will help the sector grow,” Mitra of ELP added.Sudip Mahapatra, partner at S&R Associates echoes the sentiment. “this would lead to an improvement in the overall industry standards. From a client's perspective, it will give them additional options. This will especially be relevant for global private equity funds, large multinational corporations and Indian corporates with significant overseas presence.” Share article on",https://www.vccircle.com//indiaallows-foreign-law-firms-to-practice-in-m-as-other-select-fields,Finance,"In a significant move that can open up cross-border deal pipelines for global law firms, the Bar Council of India (BCI) on Wednesday allowed foreign lawyers and law firms to practice in India.This would include matters relating to foreign law and diverse international law and international arbitration matters in India, on a reciprocity basis, the note from the BCI said.“The resistance from the legal fraternity existed due to the differences in structures and rules applicable for practicing law in India as compared to foreign jurisdictions which didn’t offer a level playing field for Indian lawyers,” said Yashojit Mitra, partner at Economic Laws Practice (ELP), a homegrown law firm.However, this move might open up doors for Indian firms to also tap into an increasing pool of cross-border work.","['the Bar Council of India', 'BCI', 'Economic Laws Practice', 'ELP']",[]

SVB collapse may shift eyes towards SoftBank investments,15 March,"The spectacular collapse of Silicon Valley Bank might increase trouble for other US lenders, and bring SoftBank Group Corp. investments under tightened scrutiny.

Notably, SoftBank shares have plunged 13% in four sessions to below 5,000 yen and are nearing a level that some see as Son’s threshold for announcing a buyback.

SVB collapse: Experts warn of bad investor behaviour as US govt stems a banking crisis,13 March,"US regulators may have stemmed a banking crisis by guaranteeing deposits of collapsed Silicon Valley Bank (SVB), but some experts warn that the move has encouraged bad investor behaviour.Following a weekend of discussions over the future of SVB owner SVB Financial Group, banking regulators unveiled emergency funding plans for the bank.Billionaire hedge fund manager Bill Ackman wrote on Twitter that if authorities had not intervened, ""we would have had a 1930s bank run continuing first thing Monday causing enormous economic damage and hardship to millions.""""More banks will likely fail despite the intervention, but we now have a clear roadmap for how the gov't will manage them.""Yet by guaranteeing that depositors would lose no money, authorities have again raised the question of moral hazard - removal of people's incentive to guard against financial risk.""This is a bailout and a major change of the way in which the U.S. system was built and its incentives,"" said Nicolas Veron, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington. ""The cost will be passed on to everyone who uses banking services.""""If all bank deposits are now insured, why do you need banks?""Separately, officials said depositors of New York's Signature Bank, which the New York state financial regulator closed on Sunday, would also be made whole at no loss to the taxpayer.

Some 89% of around $200 billion in deposits held by SVB at the end of 2022 was uninsured, according to the FDIC.Regulators have now removed that risk.But in doing so ""they took another step towards demonstrating that they are unwilling to allow free markets to sort themselves out,"" said Toronto-based independent proprietary trader Kevin Muir.Some analysts said the U.S. actions were not a bailout, because shareholders and unsecured debtholders of SVB would not be covered.""It's certainly a stress relief in the short-term, and we can worry about moral hazard and lax regulation later,"" said Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers in Connecticut, referring to the regulators' actions.""Stock and bond holders in SVB and Signature are likely wiped out. That's a lot of money that simply evaporated, which has to hurt someone.

HSBC to acquire SVB's UK unit for GBP 1,13 March,"HSBC bought the UK arm of Silicon Valley Bank for a symbolic one pound on Monday, rescuing a key lender for technology start-ups in Britain, as the biggest bank collapse since the financial crash continued to roil markets.The deal, which sees one of the world's biggest banks, with $2.9 trillion of assets, take the doomed British arm of the tech lender under its wing, brought to an end frantic weekend talks between the government, regulators, and prospective buyers.It came after U.S. authorities moved on Sunday to shore up deposits and try to stem any wider contagion from the sudden collapse of its parent Silicon Valley Bank.But a global rout in stocks continued on Monday, with European banks shedding as much as 6% on the day. That left them on track for their worst two-day drop since the Ukraine war began in February 2022. HSBC shares were down 3.8%.The rescue of SVB UK was welcomed by British government ministers, regulators and technology start-ups, who said customers would be able to bank as normal.""HSBC is Europe's largest bank, and SVB UK customers should feel reassured by the strength, safety and security that brings them,"" Britain's finance minister Jeremy Hunt said.""We were faced with a situation where we could have seen some of our most important companies - our most strategic companies - wiped out, and that would have been extremely dangerous,"" Hunt told reporters.Asked about HSBC's white-knight role, Hunt said his priority had been to avoid using British taxpayers' money. One pound is worth $1.21.The Bank of England said it had organised the sale to underpin confidence in the financial system and minimise any fallout for British technology firms.It said deposits at the bank were safe as a result of the sale, and that the wider banking system was safe.""On the face of it appears a good deal,"" Richard Marwood, senior fund manager and HSBC investor at Royal London Asset Management, said. ""SVB lacked liquidity and depositor confidence - HSBC has both of those in spades.""SVB UK is ringfenced from the U.S. group, and HSBC said the assets and liabilities of the parent company were excluded from the transaction.""This acquisition makes excellent strategic sense for our business in the UK,"" HSBC CEO Noel Quinn said in a statement.SVB UK has loans of around 5.5 billion pounds and deposits of around 6.7 billion pounds, HSBC said, adding the takeover completes immediately.The Bank of England said SVB UK had a total balance sheet size of around 8.8 billion pounds.Unlike the United States, Britain has not announced broader liquidity measures for the banking system.Dozens of listed British companies issued statements on Monday about their exposure to SVB UK, seeking to reassure investors - or in some cases warn them - just as news of the rescue deal was announced.THG, an online retail platform, card maker Moonpig and Naked Wines issued statements saying they were either not exposed or did not expect to be affected.

"SVB crisis to hit over 10,000 startups, 1 lakh jobs: Y Combinator",13 March,"In a petition to the US government on Sunday, Y Combinator stated that around 10,000 small businesses with accounts in Silicon Valley Bank may be unable to pay their employees in the next 30 days, and approximately 1 lakh jobs are anticipated to be affected as a result of the collapse. The petition submitted to US Secretary of the Treasury Janet Yellen noted that one-third of the startups in Y Combinator's community use Silicon Valley Bank as their only account.""By that measure, we can estimate that payroll-related furlough or shutdown will impact more than 10,000 small businesses and startups. If the average small business or startup employs 10 workers, this will have an immediate effect of furlough, layoff, or shutdown, affecting over 100,000 jobs in the most vibrant sector of innovation in our economy,"" the petition said. More than 3,500 co-founders, CEOs, and over 2 lakh employees of startups and small businesses, including Indian companies PayO, SaveIN, and SalaryBook, have agreed to support the petition.According to the NVCA, Silicon Valley Bank has over 37,000 small businesses with more than USD 250,000 in deposits. These balances are now unavailable to them, and without further intervention, according to the FDIC website, may be inaccessible for months to years,"" the petition said.""If we allow this to happen, it will immediately impact the US technology industry and US competitiveness worldwide and ultimately set back US competitiveness by a decade or more, while the rest of the world races forward,"" the petition said.According to statistics from the National Venture Capital Association (NVCA), Silicon Valley Bank has almost 37,000 small firms with deposits totalling more than $250,000. “These balances are now unavailable to them, and without further intervention, according to the FDIC website, may be inaccessible for months to years,"" the petition further added. “Silicon Valley Bank's failure has a real risk of systemic contagion. Its collapse has already instilled fear among founders and management teams to look for safer havens for their remaining cash, which can trigger a bank run on every other smaller bank,"" the petition stated. Earlier this week, Y Combinator’s President and CEO Garry Tan had noted that the ‘real victims’ of the SVB fallout were smaller startups who might be compelled to shut down or furlough next week. The Y Combinator CEO said this saga will set startups and innovation back by 10 years.""The SVB fallout is an “extinction level event for startups. 30% of YC companies exposed through SVB can’t make payroll in the next 30 days,"" he opined. “The real victims of the SVB fallout are the depositors: startups (10 to 100 employees) who cannot make payroll, and will have to shut down or furlough next week. If these startups wait weeks/months for their deposits, we have destroyed a generation of US startups, at random,"" he had asserted in a tweet thread.“These depositors will not survive weeks or months without some sort of plan from the govt…I recommend that you reach out to your local congressman to get this on their radar today,"" Tan had added.“When people say “oh a startup’s CFO needed to protect the money"" and “anything above $250,000 isn’t insured,"" they are literally thinking this is what you’re supposed to do if you have $12.5M in cash. Can you imagine running a business this way?"" Tan tweeted. There are also likely to be repercussions for the Indian startup sector. Meanwhile, Canadian advertising-tech company AcuityAds Holdings Inc. also suffered a major setback as a result of SVB Financial Group's insolvency. According to a statement, AcuityAds Holdings Inc. has $55 million in deposits at SVB and only $4.8 million in other banks. ""The government recognises that tech sector companies are often not cashflow positive as they grow, and that they rely on cash on deposits to cover their day-to-day costs,"" an official statement said.UK tech startup association Coadec said on Twitter that “panic"" is setting in as it is clear SVB’s collapse “could have a significant impact on the UK’s tech startup ecosystem."" The group said it has been in engaging with “Treasury and No. 10 about the potential impact"" and “work has been going on overnight on policy options.""Deposits up to $250,000 are insured by the federal government, but anything over is regarded as uninsured.

Explained: What led to Silicon Valley Bank's meltdown,13 March,"SVB Financial Group Inc's shutdown and takeover by banking regulators on Friday can be traced to the U.S. Federal Reserve raising interest rates and souring the risk appetite of investors.Here is the sequence of events that led to Silicon Valley Bank's failure:Federal Reserve Raises RatesThe Federal Reserve has been raising interest rates from their record-low levels since last year in its bid to fight inflation. Investors have less appetite for risk when the money available to them becomes expensive due to the higher rates. This weighed on technology startups - the primary clients of Silicon Valley Bank - because it made their investors more risk-averse.Some Silicon Valley Bank clients face cash crunchAs higher interest rates caused the market for initial public offerings to shut down for many startups and made private fundraising more costly, some Silicon Valley Bank clients started pulling money out to meet their liquidity needs. This culminated in Silicon Valley Bank looking for ways this week to meet its customers' withdrawals.Silicon Valley Bank sells bond portfolio at a lossTo fund the redemptions, Silicon Valley Bank sold on Wednesday a $21 billion bond portfolio consisting mostly of U.S. Treasuries. The portfolio was yielding it an average 1.79%, far below the current 10-year Treasury yield of around 3.9%. This forced SVB to recognize a $1.8 billion loss, which it needed to fill through a capital raise.SVB announces stock saleSVB announced on Thursday it would sell $2.25 billion in common equity and preferred convertible stock to fill its funding hole. Its shares ended trading on the day down 60%, as investors fretted that the deposit withdrawals may push it to raise even more capital.Stock sale collapsesSome SVB clients pulled their money from the bank on the advice of venture capital firms such as Peter Thiel's Future Fund, Reuters reported. This spooked investors such as General Atlantic that SVB had lined up for the stock sale, and the capital raising effort collapsed late on Thursday.SVB goes into receivershipSVB scrambled on Friday to find alternative funding, including through a sale of the company. Later in the day, however, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) then announced that SVB was shut down and placed under its receivership. The FDIC added that it would seek to sell SVB's assets and that future dividend payments may be made to uninsured depositors.Share article on",https://www.vccircle.com//explainedwhat-led-to-silicon-valley-bank-s-meltdown,Finance,"SVB Financial Group Inc's shutdown and takeover by banking regulators on Friday can be traced to the U.S. Federal Reserve raising interest rates and souring the risk appetite of investors.Here is the sequence of events that led to Silicon Valley Bank's failure:Federal Reserve Raises RatesThe Federal Reserve has been raising interest rates from their record-low levels since last year in its bid to fight inflation.This weighed on technology startups - the primary clients of Silicon Valley Bank - because it made their investors more risk-averse.Some Silicon Valley Bank clients face cash crunchAs higher interest rates caused the market for initial public offerings to shut down for many startups and made private fundraising more costly, some Silicon Valley Bank clients started pulling money out to meet their liquidity needs.","[""SVB Financial Group Inc's"", 'the U.S. Federal Reserve', ""Silicon Valley Bank's"", 'Federal Reserve Raises', 'RatesThe Federal Reserve', 'Silicon Valley Bank', 'Silicon Valley Bank', 'Silicon Valley Bank']","['$21 billion', '$1.8 billion', '$2.25 billion']"

"Sensex, Nifty fall tracking woes in global equity",10 March,"Shares sank about 1% on Friday, as banking and financials stocks mirrored the slump in lenders globally, while IT stocks fell on persistent worries of high interest rates ahead of key US jobs data later in the day.The Nifty 50 index fell 1% to 17,412.90, while the S&P BSE Sensex lost 1.12% to 59,135.13, posting their biggest one-day decline in over two weeks.

SVB Group attempts to calm investors' nerves after stock rout,10 March,"SVB Financial Group scrambled on Thursday to reassure its venture capital clients their money was safe after a capital raise led to its stock collapsing 60% and contributed to wiping out over $80 billion in value from bank shares.SVB, which does business as Silicon Valley Bank, launched a $1.75 billion share sale on Wednesday to shore up its balance sheet. It said in an investor prospectus it needed the proceeds to plug a $1.8 billion hole caused by the sale of a $21 billion loss-making bond portfolio consisting mostly of U.S. Treasuries. The portfolio was yielding it an average 1.79% return, far below the current 10-year Treasury yield of around 3.9%.Investors in SVB's stock fretted over whether the capital raise would be sufficient given the deteriorating fortunes of many technology startups that the bank serves. The company's stock collapsed to its lowest level since 2016, and after the market closed shares slid another 26% in extended trade.SVB's CEO Gregory Becker has been calling clients to assure them their money with the bank is safe, according to two people familiar with the matter.Some startups have been advising their founders to pull out their money from SVB as a precautionary measure, the sources added. One of them is Peter Thiel's Founders Fund, according to one of the sources.One San Francisco-based startup told Reuters they successfully wired all their funds out of SVB on Thursday afternoon, and the funds had appeared in their other bank account as a ""pending"" incoming wire by 4 pm Pacific Time on Thursday.However, the Information publication reported the bank told four clients that transfers could be delayed.SVB did not respond to multiple requests for comment.A crucial lender for early-stage businesses, SVB is the banking partner for nearly half of U.S. venture-backed technology and healthcare companies that listed on stock markets in 2022.""While VC (venture capital) deployment has tracked our expectations, client cash burn has remained elevated and increased further in February, resulting in lower deposits than forecasted,"" Becker said in a letter to investors seen by Reuters.BROADER RISKS?The funding winter is a fallout of a relentless increase in borrowing costs by the Federal Reserve over the last year as well as elevated inflation.The SVB turmoil raised investors' concerns about broader risks in the sector.Shares of First Republic, a San Francisco-based bank, sank more than 16.5% after hitting the lowest level since October 2020, becoming the second-biggest decliner in the S&P 500 index.

Caspian's debt arm disburses one-third of total FY22 funding to women-led startups,07 March,"Caspian Debt, the lending arm of India-focussed impact firm Caspian Impact Investment Adviser Pvt. Ltd, has backed over 225 social enterprises, startups and financial institutions with debt funding over the years, out of which 33% of the allocated funds were disbursed to women-led companies and impact businesses in FY22. The debt provider said in a statement on Tuesday that since inception it has funded 43% of companies, which are either spearheaded by women or deliver a product or service that benefit women or employ majority of them. As per a recent report by market intelligence platform Traxcn, while funding raised by women-led startups remained at a similar level in terms of value, at about $3.9 billion during 2021-22, these startups made up almost 11% of the total funds raised last year against 8% in the previous year. Overall funding values declined nearly 34% year-on-year to $35.6 billion last year due to weakness in late-stage funding, according to the data platform.  “We have a higher acceptance rate and retention rate for women-led organisations. We invest in women not only because it is the right thing to do but also because it makes a business case for us,” said Avishek Gupta, managing director and chief executive officer, Caspian Debt. Caspian Debt is a digital corporate lending company that offers custom debt solutions to professionally managed small or mid-market companies and start-ups founded by first-generation entrepreneurs.  The company was set up to fill the gap for non-dilutive funding available for first-generation entrepreneurs. Venture debt helps companies raise funds without diluting equity shareholding. Last month, VCCircle had reported that Caspian’s equity arm is planning to mark the final close of its food and agriculture-focused fund in a few months. The fund aims to invest in pre-series A startups with ticket sizes ranging from Rs 1-5 crore, investing in about 12 startups. “Caspian Debt’s own team is built in a way that 50% of the client facing team consists of women. 50% of Caspian Debt’s functional leads reporting to the CEO are women and women constitute more than 40% of the team.  While these investments in the eco-system and the team will take time to deliver results these need to be made now to stay true to company’s commitment to 2X challenge of making at least 30% investments in women led and women impact businesses,” Gupta added.

Why private equity firms are lending less even as interest rates rise,06 March,"Private equity firms that have for years capitalized on the regulatory woes of banks by becoming lenders to risky leveraged buyouts are doing less business just as higher interest rates have made that practice more lucrative.Buyout firms with direct lending businesses, such as Blue Owl Capital Inc, Blackstone Inc and Apollo Global Management Inc, disbursed a total of $151.3 billion in 2022 for so-called middle-market deals -- midsized acquisitions by private equity firms -- according to financial data provider Refinitiv.That was 23% less than the $195.7 billion lent out in 2021, but still 41% higher than in 2020. The amount of loans disbursed by direct lenders so far in 2023 has not shown any pickup, the Refinitiv data shows.Seven private credit executives interviewed by Reuters attributed the drop to fewer companies knocking on the door of direct-lending private equity firms, with the financing turning more expensive, and the lenders becoming more-risk averse amid concerns about a potential economic slowdown.Limited bank financing for leveraged buyouts is dissuading many potential borrowers from pursuing deals in the first place and, as a result, fewer of them are knocking on the door of private equity firms as lenders, the executives added.""There's less mergers and acquisition activity in the market because there's limited public financing,"" said Marc Lipschultz, co-president and co-founder of Blue Owl Capital Inc.The total value of leveraged buyouts in the United States fell 32% year-on-year to $345.6 billion in 2022, down from $507.6 billion in the previous year, according to Refinitiv.Also weighing on deal volumes is the cost of borrowing from private equity firms. Such a loan has always been more expensive than a traditional bank loan, yet dealmakers still opted for it when banks faced regulatory constraints in saddling a company with a lot of debt.The cost of this loan has recently soared amid higher interest rates. A $1 billion loan from a private equity firm for a company rated non-investment grade - or junk - now averages an interest rate of up to 12%, up from around 7.5% average in 2021, one of the executives interviewed by Reuters said. This has dampened demand for loans from private equity firms.Milwood Hobbs, head of North American private credit sourcing at Oaktree Capital, said some borrowers are opting to delay refinancing and repaying their outstanding loans because of the higher costs of a new financing. This has restricted the ability of some direct lenders to replenish their capital so they can finance new deals, Hobbs added. ""It's been taking more lenders and more time to club up a deal,"" he said.For their part, private equity firms have also become more risk-averse when it comes to lending, as the economic slowdown and sticky price inflation erode the credit worthiness of some borrowers.""The slowdown [in direct lending] is due to uncertainty about the economic outlook and interest rates, the continued disparity on valuation expectations and some seasonal factors, rather than a lack of debt capital available,” said Kipp deVeer, head of credit at Ares Management Corp.Debt funds launches hitThe drop in direct lending business has spilled over into fundraising for vehicles that provide the pools of capital for the loans. U.S. private debt funds raised $216.2 billion in 2022, down 6% from the year before, according to data provider Preqin.To be sure, major deals using private equity firms as lenders are still getting done as banks have continued their retrenchment from risky debt. In 2022, direct lenders backed Vista Equity Partners in its $8.4 billion acquisition of U.S. tax accounting software company Avalara Inc as well as its takeover of cybersecurity firm Knowbe4 Inc for $4.6 billion. Thoma Bravo's deal to acquire Ping Identity, a cybersecurity firm, for $2.8 billion was also financed exclusively by private credit firms.""The absolute number of direct lending loans has come down but our market share in the financing market has gone up,"" Lipschultz said.Share article on",https://www.vccircle.com//whyprivate-equity-firms-are-lending-less-even-as-interest-rates-rise,Finance,"Private equity firms that have for years capitalized on the regulatory woes of banks by becoming lenders to risky leveraged buyouts are doing less business just as higher interest rates have made that practice more lucrative.Buyout firms with direct lending businesses, such as Blue Owl Capital Inc, Blackstone Inc and Apollo Global Management Inc, disbursed a total of $151.3 billion in 2022 for so-called middle-market deals -- midsized acquisitions by private equity firms -- according to financial data provider Refinitiv.That was 23% less than the $195.7 billion lent out in 2021, but still 41% higher than in 2020.The amount of loans disbursed by direct lenders so far in 2023 has not shown any pickup, the Refinitiv data shows.Seven private credit executives interviewed by Reuters attributed the drop to fewer companies knocking on the door of direct-lending private equity firms, with the financing turning more expensive, and the lenders becoming more-risk averse amid concerns about a potential economic slowdown.Limited bank financing for leveraged buyouts is dissuading many potential borrowers from pursuing deals in the first place and, as a result, fewer of them are knocking on the door of private equity firms as lenders, the executives added.","['Blue Owl Capital Inc', 'Blackstone Inc', 'Apollo Global Management Inc', 'Refinitiv', 'Reuters']","['$151.3 billion', '$195.7 billion', '$345.6 billion', '$507.6 billion', '$1 billion', '$216.2 billion', '$8.4 billion', '$4.6 billion', '$2.8 billion']"

General Atlantic backed Acko taps into health insurance space,03 March,"Digital insurer Acko General Insurance Ltd has forayed into retail health insurance to disrupt the sector, which is primarily dominated by offline players, a top company official said. Since the insurtech unicorn launched group health insurance policies around two years ago, it has nearly 150 corporate clients. “Health is an important category for us to build and, therefore, we started first with a more aggregated business with group health insurance,” said Sanjeev Srinivasan, chief executive officer of Acko General Insurance, in an interview. India’s retail health insurance segment is dominated by five standard health insurers (SAHIs), including Religare-led Care Health Insurance, Niva (Max) Bupa Health Insurance, Star Health, Aditya Birla Health Insurance, and Allied Insurance and ManipalCigna Health InsuranceAcko General offers motor and embedded insurance as well as group health covers. “Motor insurance contributes around 50% of the business, while embedded insurance product accounts for 25-28%. Embedded insurance helps customers engage with Acko for the first time and the category has given us 60-70 million customers in the last five years,” said Srinivasan.For retail health insurance, it is looking to follow a similar approach to what it has done in the past with motor insurance, offering instant policies and claim settlements through its digital platform. “With our experience in serving corporates with group health products, the company believes it’s the right time to go in a big way to the retail category. In five years, we want health insurance to become as large as the motor category,” he added. Acko has more than doubled revenue to ₹1,087.5 crore in FY22 from ₹475.3 crore in the previous fiscal year, while its loss widened to ₹382 crore in FY22 from ₹132.5 crore in the year ago. Srinivasan said high marketing expenses is the primary reason for the surging loss and claimed that it is the largest marketing spender in the industry. “While others have made their way through agents and brokers, we have invested on marketing, creating awareness for the industry in the process,” he said. “In 3-4 years, our losses will come down and we will get to profitability, with the renewals book becoming bigger.”In addition to the health insurance plans, Acko is offering a top-up with a sum insured starting from Rs 10 lakh for consumers who want additional coverage to their existing group medical or retail health coverage. Srinivasan explained that most corporates provide insurance covers of around up to Rs 5 lakh to employees and the cap, as we have seen through the pandemic, isn’t comprehensive in many cases. “That’s where the top-up plans come into action. One can buy them even if their company provided them with coverage of any other insurer.” Meanwhile, Acko is also in the works to enter the life insurance segment with its digital-first approach. “We have recently applied for our life insurance license and have got approval for the first stage which is R1. We are closing in the next stages in a few months.

Demand for equity hedge funds, meanwhile, is low, the report said.Investment intentions favoring macro hedge funds come after a year in which that strategy, which trades globally a broad range of assets, such as bonds, currencies, interest rates, stocks and commodities, posted the best performance in the industry.Globally, macro hedge funds had gains of 9% last year, while equities hedge funds, down 10.2%, were the worst performers, data provider HFR said.Good returns are likely to lure fresh money to macro funds this year, as 28% of investors intend to add to their current portfolios, the Barclays survey found.Increased allocation to credit hedge funds has appeared as a new trend, and 34% of surveyed investors also intend to put more money into distressed funds - those that buy bonds of firms that are failing to pay debts.The survey also showed that, although investors still plan to increase allocations to hedge funds, their intention has decrease roughly 10% from last year, to 19% of the investors surveyed.Big investors, such as pension and sovereign funds, insurance companies, endowments and foundations, are planning to roughly maintain or even trim their hedge fund exposures in 2023, while more private banks and family offices see room for additional allocations.The survey showed the main reason for a meager appetite for hedge funds, mentioned by 56% of investors, was a need to rebalance portfolios after a rough year for stocks. The next major reason was poor portfolio manager performance, cited by 31%, the survey showed.Overall, hedge funds lost 4.2% last year, but they still outperformed the S&P 500, which sank roughly 20%. That left hedge funds accounting for a bigger portion of portfolios, exceeding limits set by investment committees. To rebalance, some investors are forced to divest.""There's capital outflows as a result of that - hedge funds being a victim of their own success,"" said Stahler.Share article on",https://www.vccircle.com//investorsfavor-allocations-to-macro-credit-funds-survey,Finance,"Investors such as pension funds and family offices plan to increase allocations to credit and global macro hedge funds in 2023, although their overall appetite for hedge funds is weaker this year, a survey by Barclays PLC showed on Friday.The bank interviewed 302 investors, including pension and sovereign funds, insurance companies, endowments, foundations and family offices with $7.5 trillion in assets under management.Demand for equity hedge funds, meanwhile, is low, the report said.Investment intentions favoring macro hedge funds come after a year in which that strategy, which trades globally a broad range of assets, such as bonds, currencies, interest rates, stocks and commodities, posted the best performance in the industry.Globally, macro hedge funds had gains of 9% last year, while equities hedge funds, down 10.2%, were the worst performers, data provider HFR said.Good returns are likely to lure fresh money to macro funds this year, as 28% of investors intend to add to their current portfolios, the Barclays survey found.Increased allocation to credit hedge funds has appeared as a new trend, and 34% of surveyed investors also intend to put more money into distressed funds - those that buy bonds of firms that are failing to pay debts.The survey also showed that, although investors still plan to increase allocations to hedge funds, their intention has decrease roughly 10% from last year, to 19% of the investors surveyed.Big investors, such as pension and sovereign funds, insurance companies, endowments and foundations, are planning to roughly maintain or even trim their hedge fund exposures in 2023, while more private banks and family offices see room for additional allocations.The survey showed the main reason for a meager appetite for hedge funds, mentioned by 56% of investors, was a need to rebalance portfolios after a rough year for stocks.","['Barclays PLC', 'Barclays']",['$7.5 trillion']
US President Biden names General Atlantic vice chairman Ajay Banga to head World Bank,24 February,"U.S. President Joe Biden nominated former Mastercard Inc CEO Ajay Banga to lead the World Bank, betting the India-born executive's ties to the private sector and emerging markets will jump-start the 77-year-old institution's overhaul to better address climate change.Biden's nomination on Thursday of Banga, 63, now a U.S. citizen, all but assures he will assume a job that oversees billions of dollars of funding, as it races to help developing countries address climate change.The World Bank (WB) on Wednesday said it expects to select a new president by early May to replace David Malpass, who announced his resignation last week after months of controversy sparked by his initial refusal to say if he accepted the scientific consensus on climate change, and pressure by Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen for him to adopt ""bolder"" reforms.""I think the speed of the nomination, less than 48 hours after the WB board launched the process, reflects a desire to discourage any challengers and wrap it up quickly,"" said Scott Morris, a senior fellow at the Center for Global Development and a former U.S. Treasury official.Biden noted Banga's decades of experience building global companies and public-private partnerships to fund responses to climate change and migration and said he had a proven track record working with global leaders.""Ajay is uniquely equipped to lead the World Bank at this critical moment in history,"" Biden said in a statement, hailing the business executive's Indian roots and knowledge of the challenges facing developing countries and ability to mobilize private capital to tackle big problems.Banga's work in India and other emerging markets, his ""obsession"" with expanding financial inclusion, and his deep knowledge of new technologies could help bridge the divide between rich countries and emerging markets, said Luis Alberto Moreno, who worked closely with Banga while serving as president of the Inter-American Development Bank.""He can really be a force for change,"" Moreno said, noting that Banga enjoyed the trust of financial markets.India was expected to support Banga's candidacy, according to Krishnamurthy Subramanian, the former top economic adviser to the Indian government who now serves as India's executive director at the International Monetary Fund. ""It's an elegant solution.""DIVERSITYThe bank has historically been headed by someone from the United States, its largest shareholder, while a European heads the International Monetary Fund (IMF), but developing countries and emerging markets have pushed to widen those choices.Banga's nomination is the first to be made public, but the bank will accept nominations from other member countries through March 29. Germany, another major shareholder, this week said the job should go to a woman since the bank has never been headed by a woman.A senior U.S. administration official said they did not know if other countries would nominate candidates for the post.Asked about Washington's decision not to nominate a woman, the official said Banga had ""a personal conviction and excellent track record promoting diversity, equity and inclusion in the work that he does"" and would bring that view to the bank.But Jeff Hauser, who heads the progressive Revolving Door Project, demanded Biden retract the nomination of a top official from a ""rapacious international private equity firm"" who had previously worked only in private sector firms.""Neither private equity, nor MasterCard, nor Citigroup, nor PepsiCo, nor Nestlé, nor Dow promote shared prosperity. They all do vastly more to exacerbate inequality than to fight it,"" he said in a statement.Oxfam International said the next bank president should be chosen through a transparent global process. ""The World Bank is not a U.S. bank, a commercial bank, or a private equity firm. For a job of this stature, we need more than a tap on the shoulder from President Biden.""Banga is vice chair of General Atlantic, a U.S. private equity firm that administration officials said has invested over $800 million in EV charging solutions, solar power and sustainable farming.He retired in December 2021 after 12 years at the helm of Mastercard, where administration officials noted that he helped 500 million unbanked people join the digital economy, averted layoffs of the bank's 19,000 employees during the COVID-19 pandemic, and led work on climate, gender and sustainable agriculture.Vice President Kamala Harris said Banga brought ""great insight, energy and persistence"" to his role as co-chair of the Partnership for Central America, which has mobilized $4.2 billion in public, private and nonprofit funds to advance economic opportunity in northern Central America.Share article on",https://www.vccircle.com//uspresident-biden-names-general-atlantic-vice-chairman-ajay-banga-to-head-world-bank,Finance,"U.S. President Joe Biden nominated former Mastercard Inc CEO Ajay Banga to lead the World Bank, betting the India-born executive's ties to the private sector and emerging markets will jump-start the 77-year-old institution's overhaul to better address climate change.Biden's nomination on Thursday of Banga, 63, now a U.S. citizen, all but assures he will assume a job that oversees billions of dollars of funding, as it races to help developing countries address climate change.The World Bank (WB) on Wednesday said it expects to select a new president by early May to replace David Malpass, who announced his resignation last week after months of controversy sparked by his initial refusal to say if he accepted the scientific consensus on climate change, and pressure by Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen for him to adopt ""bolder"" reforms.Germany, another major shareholder, this week said the job should go to a woman since the bank has never been headed by a woman.A senior U.S. administration official said they did not know if other countries would nominate candidates for the post.Asked about Washington's decision not to nominate a woman, the official said Banga had ""a personal conviction and excellent track record promoting diversity, equity and inclusion in the work that he does"" and would bring that view to the bank.But Jeff Hauser, who heads the progressive Revolving Door Project, demanded Biden retract the nomination of a top official from a ""rapacious international private equity firm"" who had previously worked only in private sector firms.","['Mastercard Inc', 'the World Bank', 'The World Bank', 'WB', 'Treasury', 'Revolving Door Project']","['billions of dollars', 'over $800 million', '$4.2 billion']"
Turtlemint's arm snaps up Bengaluru insurtech firm in debut deal,24 February,"Turtlefin, the software-as-a-service (SaaS) platform of insurtech startup Turtlemint, on Friday inked its maiden deal by acquiring a Bengaluru-based insurtech SaaS company for an undisclosed amount. Turtlefin, which offers end-to-end tech solutions to enable insurance sales and services and digitise through comprehensive technology support for large enterprises, bought Last Decimal to scale up its footprint in the insurtech space.  Last Decimal offers API-driven platform BancaEdge to its customers, which are large banks and insurers in India. Tapping into this platform, its clients can provide insurance to their disparate customer segments.  “This acquisition will further strengthen our bancassurance technology offering by making us the clear leader with 16 top banks in Asia present in our clientele and will unlock exponential growth opportunities for us,” said Turtlefin’s cofounder, Dhirendra Mahyavanshi.  Meanwhile, Turtlemint was founded in 2015 by former Quikr executives Mahyavanshi, Anand Prabhudesai and Kunal Shah.  The company has an omnichannel model that it says empowers insurance advisors across the country with digital tools to navigate an otherwise cumbersome offline selling process quickly. The acquisition accelerates Turtlefin’s growth trajectory by expanding its bancassurance business and market share with the addition of Last Decimal’s existing customers, the company said in a statement. “As an insurtech player, Turtlefin and Last Decimal have a shared vision of growth for our customers and insurtech segment. We will generate strong synergies and accelerate innovation through this collaboration, which will enable us to empower the insurtech growth story in India,” said AS Narayanan, chief executive officer of Last Decimal.  Mumbai-based Turtlemint had last raised $120 million in a Series E funding round at a valuation few million dollars shy of turning into a unicorn. The round was led by Amansa Capital, Jungle Ventures and Nexus Venture Partners.  New investors Vitruvian Partners and Marshall Wace, along with other existing investors participated in the funding mop-up. It also counts Blume Ventures, Sequoia Capital and GGV Capital, among others as its investors. To date, it has raised $190 million in multiple rounds.  In May last year, Mahyavanshi, in an interview with VCCircle, had hinted that the company is looking at going public sometime in 2024, provided it hits certain milestones, including profitability.  Besides India, the company also has operations in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region.Share article on",https://www.vccircle.com//turtlemints-arm-snaps-up-bengaluru-insurtech-firm-in-debut-deal,Finance,"Turtlefin, which offers end-to-end tech solutions to enable insurance sales and services and digitise through comprehensive technology support for large enterprises, bought Last Decimal to scale up its footprint in the insurtech space.The acquisition accelerates Turtlefin’s growth trajectory by expanding its bancassurance business and market share with the addition of Last Decimal’s existing customers, the company said in a statement.",['Turtlefin'],"['$120 million', 'a valuation few million dollars', '$190 million']"

Global debt falls for first time in eight years: Study,23 February,"The post-pandemic rebound in world growth and inflation last year meant the amount of debt sloshing around the global economy saw its first annual fall in dollar terms since 2015, a widely tracked study has shown.The Institute of International Finance report published on Wednesday estimated that the nominal value of global debt declined by some $4 trillion, bringing it fractionally back under the $300 trillion threshold breached in 2021.With borrowing costs on the rise, particularly for emerging markets, the retrenchment was driven entirely by wealthier countries though, which as a group saw total debt decline roughly $6 trillion to $200 trillion.In contrast, the amount of developing world debt hit a new record high of $98 trillion with Russia, Singapore, India, Mexico, and Vietnam seeing the largest individual rises.Stronger economic activity and higher inflation meanwhile, both of which erode debt levels, saw the global debt-to-GDP ratio drop over 12 percentage points to 338% of GDP, marking the second annual drop in a row.Again, though, the improvement was driven by developed markets which saw an overall 20 percentage points fall to 390%. The emerging market debt ratio rose by 2 percentage points meanwhile to 250% of GDP, largely driven by China and Singapore.Breaking the numbers down further, the IIF, a global banking trade group, estimated that the emerging market government debt-to-GDP ratio climbed to almost 65% of GDP in 2022 from just under 64%.""The external public debt burden of many developing countries worsened due to sharp losses in local currencies (in 2022) against the dollar."" the IIF said, adding that it had pushed international investor demand for local currency EM debt to multi-year lows, ""with no sign of imminent recovery"".Investment bank JPMorgan had a different take on the global debt situation, highlighting in an analysis published on Wednesday that despite last year's modest falls in developed market debt, the rise since the global financial crash fifteen years ago has been nothing short of explosive.DEBT STABILITY? FORGET ABOUT ITJPMorgan calculated that developed market public sector debt as a share of GDP has surged to 122% from 73% just before the crash and by over 30 percentage points of GDP in 13 of 21 major economies and over 45%-pts in nine of them.What makes the nearly 50%-point jump even more remarkable is that debt had risen just 40 percentage points in the 40 years leading up to the financial crisis — a period that also had significant shocks, including stagflation in the 1970s and a fiscal spending boom in the 1980s.""The step-change in debt in just 15 years raises questions of sustainability,"" JPMorgan's analysts said, pointing to the chaos already seen in UK financial markets when the short-lived Liz Truss government floated unfunded tax cut plans.Based on a debt sustainability framework, they also estimated that primary balance - net lending excluding interest - of developed markets would need to improve 3.8%-points on average from its current level of ‑3.4% of GDP just to keep debt from rising.Debt stability in the United States requires a bigger 4.4%-point tightening in policy while in Japan, which has by far the highest debt levels among major economies, the hurdle is a much higher 9%-points.Should the developed market as a whole wish to reduce debt to the levels seen before the crisis, the nearly 40%-point reduction in debt to GDP levels would require a primary lending surplus of 4.3% for 10 years — a huge fiscal tightening of 7.7%-points to be maintained for a decade.""Debt stability?

UAE currently contributes 15% to the company's overall revenue.""In the future omnichannel will be a focus.

However, in September, according to people in the know, the startup's talks with investors like L Catterton and Amazon were called off due to differences in valuation and issues with growth potential.  As a result, FreshToHome's plans to achieve unicorn status came to a halt at that time.While Kadavil declined to comment on the valuation, he did say that the company is operationally profitable.“We are now a ‘proficorn’ with operational profitability across the company. As we strive to offer more value to our farmers and fishers, customers, employees, and investors, our focus is on profitability and sustainable value creation,” he said.  “Over the last few years, we have built a strong presence. Since we source straight from farmers, our overall gross margin stands at around 40%. Our biggest advantage is sourcing, the ability to buy things at an attractive price and sell them at a mass market price, as we are positioned as a value brand. Due to this, our target market does not get saturated like how it happens in a premium segment.""  JP Morgan acted as the placement agent to FreshToHome for the fundraise.  Before starting FreshToHome in 2015, Kadavil was previously heading the India vertical of online game-maker Zynga Inc. FreshToHome - who delivers poultry, meat, and seafood to your doorstep - claims to cater to over 2 million orders a month across over 150 towns in India and majority parts of the UAE. The platform enables its sellers to source meat and fish directly from livestock farmers and fishermen and supplies fresh produce at mass-market prices in all major Indian markets, including Delhi-NCR, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Punjab, Haryana, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, and Telangana, as well as Tamil Nadu, Kolkata, and Kerala.  The company competes with the likes of Licious, which also claims itself to be the first unicorn among consumer-facing startups. Licious too had in March this year raised $150 million in an extended Series F round of funding led by Singapore-based Amansa Capital.  Captain Fresh is another player in the segment which has recently received a big-sized cheque from the likes of Prosus Ventures (formerly known as Naspers Ventures) and Tiger Global Management. FreshToHome, on the other hand, had last secured its equity funding in October 2020. It mopped up $121 million in its Series C funding round led by the Investment Corporation of Dubai (ICD), the Gulf emirate’s sovereign wealth fund, and Bahrain-based alternative investment firm Investcorp. It bagged $20 million in a Series B funding round led by Iron Pillar in August 2019 and three months before that pocketed $11 million in its Series A financing. Share article on",https://www.vccircle.com//freshtohomeraises-series-d-funding-led-by-amazon-smbhav,Finance,"In a bid to focus on omnichannel going ahead, the meat deliverer is also looking to expand into Saudi Arabia, Kadavil added.FreshToHome's foray into Saudi Arabia will be its second bet in the West Asian region after it launched operations in the United Arab Emirates two years ago.Before starting FreshToHome in 2015, Kadavil was previously heading the India vertical of online game-maker Zynga Inc. FreshToHome - who delivers poultry, meat, and seafood to your doorstep - claims to cater to over 2 million orders a month across over 150 towns in India and majority parts of the UAE.","['Kadavil', 'Kadavil', 'Zynga Inc.', 'UAE']","['$104 million', '$150 million', '$121 million', '$20 million', '$11 million']"
"Sensex, Nifty end lower in cautious trade ahead of Fed minutes",21 February,"Markets ended lower for the third day in a row on Tuesday, having spent the session in a narrower-than-usual trading range on caution ahead of the minutes from the US Federal Reserve's meeting amid fears of a higher-for-longer interest rate regime. The Nifty 50 index fell 0.10% down at 17,826.70, while the S&P BSE Sensex dipped 0.03% to 60,672.72. Both benchmarks opened higher before reversing course. The Nifty traded in a 124-points range, well below this month's daily average of around 195 points. The minutes of the Fed's latest policy meeting are due on Wednesday and come as recent US data – on inflation, retail sales and jobs — have strengthened the case for further rate hikes, a view that two Fed officials recently advocated for. ""With the kind of domestic, as well as global economic data coming in, we might see a selling in growth stocks and buying in value stocks,"" said Saurabh Jain, assistant vice-president, research, SMC Global Securities. Ten of the 13 sectoral indexes declined. The US rates-sensitive IT stocks fell 0.88%, with nine of the 10 constituents in the red. Financials were little changed. Jain said IT stocks, up 8.7% so far this year, were likely to be losing steam, with investors moving into financial shares. The fast moving consumer goods index bucked the broader trend to add 0.11%. Marico was the top gainer, rising over 2% after Citi said it expects volume growth of core brands to accelerate. Siemens rose over 3% and hit a record high, after Jefferies called it its top pick among industrial stocks. On the flip side, UFlex dropped nearly 2% on reports that the country's income tax department was searching the flexible packaging products manufacturer's office. Multiple media reports suggested the equity market trade timing is likely to be extended to 5 p.m. IST, from 3:30 p.m. The Securities and Exchange Board of India is yet to comment.Share article on",https://www.vccircle.com//sensexnifty-end-lower-in-cautious-trade-ahead-of-fed-minutes,Finance,"Markets ended lower for the third day in a row on Tuesday, having spent the session in a narrower-than-usual trading range on caution ahead of the minutes from the US Federal Reserve's meeting amid fears of a higher-for-longer interest rate regime.The minutes of the Fed's latest policy meeting are due on Wednesday and come as recent US data – on inflation, retail sales and jobs — have strengthened the case for further rate hikes, a view that two Fed officials recently advocated for.","[""the US Federal Reserve's"", 'Fed', 'Fed']",[]

Ixigo invests in e-bus startup FreshBus,16 February,"Online travel aggregator Ixigo has invested Rs 26 crore (around $3.1 million) in Bengaluru-based electric bus startup FreshBus for the launch of inter-city electric bus services across India.The EV company, which will commence its services simultaneously from Hyderabad and Bengaluru with the launch of 24 electric buses, plans to scale up its operations to over 1,000 buses pan-India in the next 2-3 years. It will likely announce its first operational routes in March 2023. It claims that it will offer an alternative for convenient, affordable, and environment-friendly inter-city bus travel in India. The bus platform will run on a full-stack business model to deliver a wide range of services including noise-free air-conditioned cabin, comfortable seating, uniformed and friendly crew, IOT-enabled real-time air-quality and temperature monitoring, security CCTVs, personal charging docks, Wi-Fi, real-time tracking, alcohol checks and more, the company said in a release. FreshBus is founded by Sudhakar Reddy Chirra, who previously built the aggregator Abhibus. The company was acquired by ixigo in August 2021 in a cash and stock business transfer agreement. Chirra has over 15 years of experience in the bus domain and in managing technology-led businesses. FreshBus aims to improve quality and customer experience to make bus travel a hassle-free experience for all while offering a more environment-friendly and affordable alternative to existing inter-city public transport currently dominated by fossil-fuel buses, said Chirra, founder and chief executive officer, FreshBus.“A single FreshBus will save over 90,000 litres of diesel and reduce close to 200 tonnes of carbon dioxide emission in one year. That is equivalent to the effect of almost 10,000 trees on the environment,"" Chirra claimed.“There are nearly 100,000 inter-city buses operating in the country, the majority of which are diesel based and are a major source of urban air pollution…FreshBus buses will be able to cover up to 375 km on a single charge with zero emissions, enabling greener, affordable and safer rides,” Ixigo’s cof-ounders Aloke Bajpai and Rajnish Kumar said in a joint statement. Due to the rising EV demand and the need to cut carbon emissions, investments in Indian EV startups have increased in recent years. The use of EVs has been encouraged by the federal and state governments, which has sped up the industry's expansion.VC and PE firms, and even traditional automakers have invested millions of dollars into EV startups creating new technology and business models. These startups are developing a range of products, including infrastructure for charging and batteries.For instance, Simple Energy recently raised over $20 million in a bridge funding round that saw participation from high-net-worth individuals such as Thyrocare Technologies’ founder Arokiaswamy Velumani, Gokaldas Group’s Ashwin Hinduja, Nash Industries’ owners Sanjay and Sandeep Wadhawa, and Purple Moon Ventures, among others.Also, EV-as-a-service provider Zypp Electric raised Series B funding of $25 million (around Rs 206 crore) led by battery swapping systems provider Gogoro.

"India M&A momentum to remain strong in 2023, says report",14 February,"Mergers and acquisitions (M&A) in India are expected to increase in 2023, as global companies remain keen on growing their presence in India, according to a report by consulting giant Deloitte.This would further be fuelled by increasing domestic demand in the country, supported by availability of companies with healthy financials, Deloitte said in its latest India M&A trends report.“With Indian economy likely to do well despite global economic headwinds, we expect that M&A activity in India will remain robust, with companies expected to continue picking up attractively valued targets in India and abroad,” said Mayank Jaswal, partner - consulting, Deloitte India said in a statement.Well-capitalised Indian companies are likely to invest to acquire key technology capabilities with large deals likely in sectors such as technology, media & telecommunications (TMT) and financial services sector, the report said.The positive outlook comes on the back of high growth in India’s M&A market, which grew by 40% to cross $160 billion in value in 2022 . A large number of these deals were strategic M&A deals, which grew 2X to 126 during the year, compared to 56 deals in 2021.  “Domestic companies had healthy balance sheets and were able to deploy their cash to do more deals,” said Jaswal.Private equity (PE) deal activity, on the other hand, fell by 38% to 37 deals in 2022, as rising cost of capital dampened the return on investment, further worsened by geopolitical uncertainty and rising inflation.“Due to lack of PE activity as well as inflationary pressures impacting margins, valuations have tempered, and these are expected to help drive the pickup in the PE activity by H2 (second half) 2023,” the report said.Going forward, in 2023, Deloitte expects more companies in TMT, financial services and pharmaceutical to use more M&A opportunities, considering the need for technological enhancement to gain a competitive edge.Share article on",https://www.vccircle.com//indiam-a-momentum-to-remain-strong-in-2023-says-report,Finance,"Mergers and acquisitions (M&A) in India are expected to increase in 2023, as global companies remain keen on growing their presence in India, according to a report by consulting giant Deloitte.This would further be fuelled by increasing domestic demand in the country, supported by availability of companies with healthy financials, Deloitte said in its latest India M&A trends report.“With Indian economy likely to do well despite global economic headwinds, we expect that M&A activity in India will remain robust, with companies expected to continue picking up attractively valued targets in India and abroad,” said Mayank Jaswal, partner - consulting, Deloitte India said in a statement.Well-capitalised Indian companies are likely to invest to acquire key technology capabilities with large deals likely in sectors such as technology, media & telecommunications (TMT) and financial services sector, the report said.The positive outlook comes on the back of high growth in India’s M&A market, which grew by 40% to cross $160 billion in value in 2022 .“Domestic companies had healthy balance sheets and were able to deploy their cash to do more deals,” said Jaswal.Private equity (PE) deal activity, on the other hand, fell by 38% to 37 deals in 2022, as rising cost of capital dampened the return on investment, further worsened by geopolitical uncertainty and rising inflation.“Due to lack of PE activity as well as inflationary pressures impacting margins, valuations have tempered, and these are expected to help drive the pickup in the PE activity by H2 (second half) 2023,” the report said.Going forward, in 2023, Deloitte expects more companies in TMT, financial services and pharmaceutical to use more M&A opportunities, considering the need for technological enhancement to gain a competitive edge.Share article on","['Deloitte', 'Deloitte', 'Deloitte India', 'media & telecommunications', 'Deloitte', 'TMT']",['$160 billion']

IT stocks lift markets ahead of key US inflation data,14 February,"Markets advanced on Tuesday, led by gains in IT stocks ahead of US inflation data later in the day, while investors brushed off the impact of a bigger-than-expected jump in domestic inflation. The Nifty 50 index settled 0.89% up at 17,929.85, its highest close since January 24, when US short-seller Hindenburg Research's scathing report on the Adani Group triggered a slide in domestic equities. The S&P BSE Sensex rose 0.99% to 61,032.26, its highest in nearly four weeks. Thirty of Nifty 50 constituents rose. Adani Enterprises was among the top gainers, rising 1.88% after reporting a swing to a third-quarter profit from a year-ago loss and said it had made no “material financial adjustments”in the wake of the Hindenberg report. Eight of the 13 major sectoral indexes rose, with IT stocks rising nearly 1%. All the 10 constituents of the IT index advanced. The rise mirrored the gains in their US peers overnight and ahead of inflation data for the United States, from where India's software exporters draw a significant share of their revenue. Analysts estimate US CPI for January rose 0.5% month-on-month. ""Investors are finding safety in the IT sector compared to other sectors like banking, in the light of the Adani saga,"" said Anita Gandhi, director at Arihant Capital Markets. On the domestic front, India's annual wholesale price inflation eased in January to 4.73% year-on-year, on cooling prices of some raw materials, government data showed on Tuesday. The report comes a day after data showed retail inflation jumped 6.52% in January – beating estimates and again topping the upper limit of RBI's targeted band of 2-6% – that economists said cemented the likelihood of further rate hikes. ITC jumped 3.27% and lifted the FMCG index, ahead of the record date for the interim dividend for FY2022-23.Share article on",https://www.vccircle.com//itstocks-lift-markets-ahead-of-key-us-inflation-data,Finance,"Markets advanced on Tuesday, led by gains in IT stocks ahead of US inflation data later in the day, while investors brushed off the impact of a bigger-than-expected jump in domestic inflation.The report comes a day after data showed retail inflation jumped 6.52% in January – beating estimates and again topping the upper limit of RBI's targeted band of 2-6% – that economists said cemented the likelihood of further rate hikes.",['RBI'],[]
PhonePe raises additional $100 mn as part of $1 bn round,14 February,"Walmart-owned digital payments platform PhonePe said it raised an additional $100 million in primary capital from Tiger Global, Ribbit Capital and TVS Capital Funds on Tuesday at a pre-money valuation of $12 billion.This follows the firm’s $350 million primary fundraising from General Atlantic in January at a similar valuation. The latest investment is the second tranche of the company’s ongoing $1 billion funding round that could see more global investors take part.PhonePe said it would use the capital to expand its payments and insurance businesses, as well as launch and scale new businesses like lending, stockbroking, ONDC (Open Network for Digital Commerce)-based shopping and account aggregators over the next few years.“Our investment in PhonePe reinforces our conviction in backing best-in-class founders while betting on the financial digitization of the next 450 million Indians,” said Gopal Srinivasan, chairman and managing director at TVS Capital Funds. He added that PhonePe’s strong growth in financial services across payments, insurance, lending, and opportunities through ONDC and Appstore were key factors for TVS’ investment.The latest tranche follows PhonePe’s change of domicile to India and a spin-off from parent Flipkart in December ahead of a planned public listing later this year. PhonePe was acquired by Flipkart in 2016.As part of the transaction, existing shareholders of Flipkart Singapore and PhonePe Singapore, led by Walmart, bought shares directly in PhonePe India. This is aimed at allowing both companies to chart their own growth paths, build their businesses independently, and help unlock and maximize enterprise value for their shareholders.The shift from Singapore to India has, meanwhile, come at a steep price for PhonePe investors, who had to shell out a whopping ₹8,000 crore in taxes to move the base from Singapore to India. PhonePe, backed by investors including Walmart and Tencent, also stands to lose $900 million of accumulated losses as it can’t save taxes by offsetting its losses as tax authorities view the shift in domicile as a restructuring event.In terms of monthly UPI transaction volume, PhonePe had a 47% market share in December, according to data from the National Payments Corp. of India (NPCI). Rivals Google Pay and Paytm had a market share of 34% and 15%, respectively.Founded in 2015 by Sameer Nigam, Rahul Chari and Burzin Engineer, PhonePe forayed into financial services in 2017 and has since introduced several mutual funds and insurance products on the platform. It claims to have more than 400 million registered users and 35 million offline merchants spread across India, covering 99% of pin codes in the country.Last week, PhonePe launched support for cross-border payments through a unified payments interface (UPI), allowing Indian travellers to instantly pay foreign merchants using its network.Last financial year, PhonePe’s consolidated operating revenue more than doubled to ₹1,646 crore from ₹690 crore in FY21.

Asia-focused hedge funds see strongest month in Jan since 2016: Goldman Sachs,14 February,"After seeing record outflows in 2022, Asia-focused hedge funds posted a 5.3% gain in a January rally to mark their best monthly performance in years, bolstered mainly by a rebound in Chinese share prices, Goldman Sachs said in a note.The funds' performance in January, the strongest in Goldman Sachs records going back to 2016, comes as China's economy reopens after years of COVID-19 curbs and U.S. interest rates appear to be close to a peak.MSCI's Asia Pacific stocks index soared 7.8% last month, outperforming the rest of the world.For hedge funds, the best gains in January had come from a strategy of taking long and short positions in Chinese shares based on company fundamentals, Goldman Sachs said. The strategy returned 7.7% in January. Taking the same approach to Japanese shares yielded 2.6%.A separate gauge by Eurekahedge also showed Asian hedge funds rallied for the third consecutive month in January, with a 4.8% rise.Asia-focused hedge funds dropped an average 8% last year, with a net outflow of $7.7 billion from Asia ex-Japan funds, according to Eurekahedge data from With Intelligence. Including Japan, the outflow was $8.5 billion.Don Steinbrugge, founder and chief executive of Agecroft Partners, a hedge fund consulting firm based in New York, said Asia-focused hedge funds were significantly under-represented in most global investors' portfolios. The under exposure had increased over the past years as investors had shifted assets out of Asia and into North America and Europe, Steinbrugge said.Investors' interest in Asia and China this year should increase due to a weakening of the U.S. dollar and more attractive valuations of regional stocks relative to the U.S. markets, he said.""European and U.S. investors view China's change in COVID policy as positive,"" he said, referring to the abandonment of pandemic controls in late 2022. But ""some investors want to wait and see a stabilization of the real estate market.""The Asia macro strategy - betting on macroeconomic and political trends - returned 6%, while Asia equity long/short gained 5% and Asia credit long/short gained 4%.

"At least two more Fed rate hikes and no cut this year, say economists",14 February,"The US Federal Reserve will raise interest rates at least twice more in coming months, with the risk they go higher still, according to a majority of economists in a Reuters poll who see no cut by year-end.This brings the majority of private-sector forecasters in line with the central bank's own projections and rhetoric, leaving financial market traders alone in clinging on to hopes rates will start falling later this year.Thanks to much stronger than expected U.S. jobs data earlier this month, Fed policymakers, including Fed chair Jerome Powell, have reiterated a higher-for-longer mantra that market traders have been fighting for months.With inflation still at more than twice the Fed's 2.0% target, 46 of 86 economists in the Feb. 8-13 Reuters poll predicted the U.S. central bank will go for two more 25 basis point hikes, in March and May, not just March. That would mean a peak of 5.00%-5.25%, 25 basis points higher than what the majority had been predicting since November. All 37 who replied to an extra question said the bigger risk was the fed funds rate would peak even higher.""We currently expect two more hikes...But the risk is towards higher rates. The labor market remains strong and it's going to take a bit more time for it to start showing signs of deterioration,"" said Oscar Munoz, U.S. macro strategist at TD Securities, who changed his forecast last month.""That puts the risk of keeping services inflation and wage growth elevated for quite a bit and that's going to filter back into inflation. That means the Fed is going to keep the policy rate at high levels for quite a bit longer.""The most recent U.S. inflation data is due to be released later on Tuesday and could change the rate outlook a bit more.The consumer price index (CPI) is forecast to have risen 0.5% on the month in January with the core index, which strips out food and energy, rising 0.4%, according to a separate Reuters survey. Those follow more mild readings for December.There was no clear consensus on the Fed's policy rate at the end of 2023.

Adani tries to calm investors as regulator confirms probe,13 February,"Adani Group sought to reassure investors on Monday, saying it had strong cashflows and its business plans were fully funded, as an Indian regulator confirmed it was investigating a critical report by a short-seller that has battered the group's stocks. Led by billionaire businessman Gautam Adani, the group's seven listed stocks have together lost about $120 billion in market value since a January 24 report by US short-seller Hindenburg Research accused it of improper use of offshore tax havens and stock manipulation, allegations the group has denied. The turmoil continued on Monday, with shares in the listed companies extending their losses. Seeking to calm investors, the conglomerate in a statement to Reuters said the balance sheet of each of its independent portfolio companies was ""very healthy"", adding it had secure assets and strong cashflows, with its business plans ""fully funded"". ""We are confident in the continued ability of our portfolio to deliver superior returns to shareholders,"" Adani Group said in the emailed statement. Bloomberg News reported on Monday the group had halved its revenue growth target and planned to scale down capital spending. A company spokesperson told Reuters earlier in the day the report was ""baseless, speculative"", without elaborating. The Adani crisis has sparked worries of financial contagion in India, protests in parliament where lawmakers have demanded an investigation, ratings outlook downgrades of some Adani units and cast a shadow on the group's capital raising plans. Gautam Adani has also lost his crown as Asia's richest person. Adani Group's statement said ""once the current market stabilises, each entity will review its own capital market strategy."" The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has been probing the market rout, including examining trade patterns and any potential irregularities in the $2.5 billion share sale of flagship company Adani Enterprises that the Adani group was forced to cancel due to the stock's plunge, Reuters has previously reported. SEBI confirmed the existence of the investigation for the first time in a Supreme Court filing. ""SEBI is already enquiring into both the allegations made in the Hindenburg report as well as the market activity immediately preceding and post the publication of the report,"" the regulator said in the filing seen by Reuters, adding the matter was in early stages of examination. During a court hearing on Monday where the Supreme Court heard public interest petitions that raise concerns about steep investor losses, India’s Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, arguing on behalf of the government and SEBI, said there was no objection if a panel was setup to examine protection mechanisms for investors. The judges told him to come back with the remit of such a panel, and scheduled a further hearing for Friday. SEBI is set to brief federal finance ministry officials on February 15 on its investigation into the shelved share sale, two sources told Reuters on Monday. SEBI and the finance ministry did not respond immediately to Reuters requests for comment. Last week, Moody's downgraded the ratings outlook for some Adani companies, while index provider MSCI said it would cut the weightings of some in its stock indexes. On Monday, all stocks of the Adani group were under pressure. Adani Enterprises fell 7%, while Adani Total Gas, Adani Power and Adani Transmission lost 5% each. Adani Total, a joint venture with France's TotalEnergies, has lost 70% since the Hindenburg report, while Adani Enterprises is down 50%. Since the Hindenburg report's release, Adani Group has prepaid some of its $25 billion debt and pledged to independently review the short-seller's claims, but the carnage in its securities has continued. ""The effects of management's attempts to reassure investors will take at least three to six months to start reflecting in share prices. Price damage has been significant,"" said Avinash Gorakshakar, head of research at Profitmart Securities. In Mumbai, around 100 political workers and activists of opposition Communist Party of India marched shouting anti-Adani slogans and holding posters with cartoons of Adani and Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Opposition critics accuse Modi's government of giving undue favours to the Adani Group. The government and Adani both deny excessively close ties. ""The effect of our protests is visible as Adani shares continue to fall,"" Feroze Mithiborwala, one of the protesters, said. In recent days, concerns have also arisen about exposure of Indian and foreign lenders to the Adani Group. In its rebuttal of Hindenburg's allegations, the conglomerate had pointed to its international banking relationships as a sign of its strength. Singapore's DBS Group said on Monday it had a S$1.3 billion ($976 million) exposure to Adani group companies, out of which S$1 billion was to finance its cement business. DBS said it was not concerned about its exposure to the group.Share article on",https://www.vccircle.com//adanitries-to-calm-investors-as-regulator-confirms-probe,Finance,"The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has been probing the market rout, including examining trade patterns and any potential irregularities in the $2.5 billion share sale of flagship company Adani Enterprises that the Adani group was forced to cancel due to the stock's plunge, Reuters has previously reported.""SEBI is already enquiring into both the allegations made in the Hindenburg report as well as the market activity immediately preceding and post the publication of the report,"" the regulator said in the filing seen by Reuters, adding the matter was in early stages of examination.","['The Securities and Exchange Board of India', 'Adani Enterprises', 'Adani', 'Reuters', 'Reuters']","['about $120 billion', '$2.5 billion', '$25 billion', 'a S$1.3 billion', '$976 million']"
"Goldman, TVS lead $150 million round in InsuranceDekho",14 February,"New York-based Goldman Sachs Asset Management and homegrown mid-market private-equity firm TVS Capital Funds led a $150 million (about ₹1,240 crore) investment in InsuranceDekho in the largest Series A round of funding by an insurtech startup in India.Investcorp, Avataar Ventures and LeapFrog Investments also took part in the fundraise by the insurance unit of used-car platform CarDekho. The fundraise comprised about $110 million in equity, and the remainder $40 million in debt. The company didn’t identify the debt investors.VCCircle first reported in November that Goldman Sachs and TVS Capital were likely to lead InsuranceDekho’s first external funding round that is likely to value the firm at $450-500 million. The firm’s valuation in the latest round couldn’t be ascertained. “We need to go beyond the urban regions when it comes to insurance penetration in the country.

Ltd.“The insurance business is near breakeven and is expected to double this year. The premium of insurances will stand at more than ₹180 crore, with health and life making up for about 22% of the business,” Jain said at the time.In the financial year ended March 2022, InsuranceDekho posted operating revenue of ₹47.9 crore, up from ₹29.7 crore in FY21.

India IPO activity picks in Q3FY23: Report,13 February,"Initial public offering (IPO) momentum in India picked up in the last quarter compared to the world, with the domestic market witnessing the highest number of IPOs in three months-ended December 2022. According to a trends report by consulting company EY, 18 Indian entities filed for IPO in the last quarter versus four in the preceding quarter (Q2FY23). Out of these, 11 IPOs were from the retail sector, followed by nine from the industrial products sector and finally eight coming from tech.“IPO activity in the fourth quarter increased by 4x as compared to the previous quarter, demonstrating the growing prominence that our country is gaining as a global investment hub,” said Adarsh Ranka, Partner with an Indian member firm of EY Global. Companies such as KFin Technologies, Kaynes Tech, Bikaji Foods went public during the quarter. The IPO of Global Health Ltd, which operates speciality hospital chain Medanta, had the largest issue size of $0.27 billion. It saw Anant Investments, an affiliate of private equity major Carlyle Group, among others offload stakes. “While IPO issue proceeds by the companies are relatively small, the recent IPO activity is likely to welcome a brighter outlook for Indian capital markets this year,” Ranka added. In what could be signs of a better IPO scenario this year, more than 10 companies have already filed their preliminary documents –draft red herring prospectus (DRHPs) - with market regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) in 2023 so far. “We saw several IPOs concluding with good post-listing performance. Unlike earlier when capital markets significantly relied on foreign institutional investors, this robust growth pattern will continue because these companies are supported by domestic retail and institutional capital,” said Prashant Singhal, also a partner at EY. Some companies that listed at strong premiums include Electronics Mart India, who at Rs 90 apiece, at a premium of more than 52% as compared to its IPO issue. Bikaji Foods International debuted at an 8% premium over IPO price on the NSE. Global Health listed at 19% premium over issue price.

"Adani Group cuts revenue growth target, capex",13 February,"The Adani Group has halved its revenue growth target and aims to scale down fresh capital expenditure, days after US-based short seller Hindenburg Research put out a tweet, talking about a negative report on the conglomerate that it had published. The billionaire now seeks to rebuild investor confidence after its listed entities have lost more than $120 billion in market value post Hindenburg's scathing report about the group. The US short seller report concluded by saying: “After extensive research, we have taken a short position in Adani Group companies through US-traded bonds and non-Indian-traded derivative instruments."" The report made many “allegations"" against the group, which has triggered a stock rout. However, the Adani Group has rejected the allegations and denied any wrongdoing, saying the claims are baseless and published a 413-page rebuttal. Gautam Adani’s conglomerate will now shoot for revenue growth of 15% to 20% for at least the next financial year, down from the 40% growth originally targeted, said a Bloomberg report. Meanwhile, capital expenditure plans will also be scaled down, the report added, as the group prioritises bolstering its financial health over aggressive expansion. The shift shows how the ports-to-power conglomerate is focused on conserving cash, repaying debt and retrieving pledged shares as it scrambles to undo the damage from the report published late 24 January.  Even though the group has denied the allegations of accounting fraud and stock manipulation levied by the American short seller, the scandal triggered a fall in the price of their listed stocks. Holding back on investments for even as little as three months could save the conglomerate as much as $3 billion, the report said, adding that the plans are still imminent. It further said that funds that can be deployed to pay down debt or boost the cash pile. The group’s plans are still being reviewed and are set to be finalised in the coming weeks, according to the report. Adani group firms pledge additional shares for key lender Three Adani group companies -- Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone, Adani Transmission Ltd and Adani Green Energy Ltd -- have pledged additional shares for State Bank of India (SBI). SBICAP Trustee Co, a unit of the country's biggest state lender SBI, said it had pledges for shares worth 1% of Adani Ports, up from 0.65%, for 0.55% of Adani Transmission, up from 0.44%, and for 1.06% of Adani Green, up from 0.68%. The additional pledges are part of a $300 million letter of credit -- issued by a bank to another bank as a guarantee for payments made – provided by SBI for Adani group's Carmichael coal mining project in Australia, a statement from the bank said. The collateral is reviewed at the end of each month to assess if it needs to be topped up on account of any mark-to-market losses, SBI added. Assuage concerns The Hindenburg report was published just two days before 27 January, the day the follow-on public offer (FPO) of ₹20,000 crore of Adani Enterprises was ready to hit the market. In the days following the Hindenburg-triggered stock meltdown, Adani and his companies have been working to assuage investor and lender concerns. The stock selloff resumed after MSCI Inc slashed the amount of shares it considers freely tradable for four of the companies – a move that will result in lower weightings in its indexes. Adani Group has been focusing on staving off concerns about its financial health and shoring up sentiment.  Earlier this month, the group said Adani and his family prepaid loans worth $1.11 billion to release pledged shares across three firms while the ports unit announced plans on 8 February to repay ₹5,000 crore debt in the year starting April to boost a key credit metric.  The conglomerate plans to prepay a $500 million bridge loan due next month after some banks balked at refinancing the debt. It was part of fundraising last year to finance the acquisition of Holcim Ltd’s India cement assets. Independent audit of group companies The conglomerate plans to hire one of the “big six"" global accounting firms to evaluate its corporate governance and audit practices following allegations of fraud by the US short seller. The independent audit will be commissioned after the completion of the group’s flagship Adani Enterprises Ltd’s ₹20,000 crore follow-on public offering, and based on that, the legal options will be decided, the people said, requesting anonymity. The fresh audit is primarily meant to restore the public’s confidence and arrest the fall in Adani group stocks. In UK, the Adani Group has dropped Deloitte as the auditor of its various subsidiaries last year, replacing it with a far smaller accountancy firm. Crowe UK has replaced the Big Four firm as the auditor of UK entities including Adani Energy Holdings Ltd after the Indian firm bought them in 2021. The UK subsidiaries of the Adani Group include a portfolio of renewable power plants across India that were sold to Adani Green Energy Limited by SoftBank Group and Bharti Enterprises in 2021. Adani hired Crowe UK to audit the companies after the acquisition, ditching Deloitte which used to audit the accounts. Earlier this month, the ministry of corporate affairs has reportedly started a preliminary review of Adani Group's financial statements and other regulatory submissions made over the years.Share article on",https://www.vccircle.com//adanigroup-cuts-revenue-growth-target-capex,Finance,"Even though the group has denied the allegations of accounting fraud and stock manipulation levied by the American short seller, the scandal triggered a fall in the price of their listed stocks.The independent audit will be commissioned after the completion of the group’s flagship Adani Enterprises Ltd’s ₹20,000 crore follow-on public offering, and based on that, the legal options will be decided, the people said, requesting anonymity.",['Adani Enterprises Ltd’s'],"['more than $120 billion', 'as much as $3 billion', '$300 million', '20,000', '$1.11 billion', '5,000', '$500 million']"

Markets muted on Fed rate-hike fears; Adani stocks resume fall,09 February,"Markets struggled for direction before closing marginally higher on Thursday as gains in high-weightage financials and tech stocks offset concerns over the US Federal Reserve's rate-hike trajectory and a slide in Adani Group stocks. The Nifty 50 index closed 0.12% higher at 17,893.45, while the S&P BSE Sensex ended 0.23% up at 60,806.22. Both the indexes traded in a tight range between 0.35% gains and 0.6% losses. Eight of the 13 major sectoral indexes logged losses, with metals falling 1.58%. Adani Enterprises, with nearly 20% weightage on the metal index, led the decline. Financials and information technology stocks added 0.14% and 0.7%, respectively. Twenty-five of the Nifty 50 constituents declined, with Adani Enterprises and Adani Ports falling 11% and 2.83%, respectively. Adani Group shares had recouped losses for two consecutive sessions after a sharp selloff following US short-seller Hindenburg Research's January 24 report, which flagged concerns regarding the conglomerate's financials. However, index provider MSCI on Thursday said it had determined that some Adani securities should no longer be designated free float. Several institutional investors and funds allocate per the MSCI index weighting and consider it a benchmark. If the weightage of Adani stocks slips following a review, it could lead to outflows and a further slide in value, two analysts said. Wall Street equities fell overnight following divergent views on rate hikes from key Fed officials. Governor Christopher Waller said that the battle to reach Fed's 2% inflation target ""might be a long fight,"" while Governor Lisa Cook was optimistic of a ""soft landing."" In a speech on Tuesday, Fed Chair Jerome Powell underlined that ""disinflation"" was underway. ""Inflation is unlikely to fall off the cliff in a hurry despite the Federal Reserve's measures,"" Astha Jain of Hem Securities said, adding that the uncertainty in domestic markets is likely to continue in the first half of this year. The fall in the dollar index could benefit emerging markets like India, but high valuations and persistent foreign selling remain a worry, analysts said. Share article on",https://www.vccircle.com//marketsmuted-on-fed-rate-hike-fears-adani-stocks-resume-fall,Finance,"Markets struggled for direction before closing marginally higher on Thursday as gains in high-weightage financials and tech stocks offset concerns over the US Federal Reserve's rate-hike trajectory and a slide in Adani Group stocks.""Inflation is unlikely to fall off the cliff in a hurry despite the Federal Reserve's measures,"" Astha Jain of Hem Securities said, adding that the uncertainty in domestic markets is likely to continue in the first half of this year.","[""the US Federal Reserve's"", 'Adani Group', ""the Federal Reserve's""]",[]

Markets close higher after expected RBI rate hike,08 February,"Markets settled higher on Wednesday after the Reserve Bank of India delivered an expected 25 basis points rate hike, while Adani Group shares recouped losses for a second straight day. The Nifty 50 index was up 0.85% at 17,871.70 at close, their highest in two weeks, while the S&P BSE Sensex finished 0.63% higher to 60,663.79. Both indexes snapped two straight sessions of losses. The central bank raised the key policy repo rate in line with economists' expectations, but surprised markets by leaving the door open to more tightening, saying core inflation remained high. A Reuters poll had showed the RBI would likely raise rates by 25 bps to mark the final increase in its current tightening cycle, before taking a pause for the rest of the year. ""Nifty is back in the range that it was for sometime before the Adani fiasco, and we expect a range-bound market for the next few days,"" said Samrat Dasgupta, chief executive officer of Esquire Capital Investment Advisors. The Nifty 50 traded in a range between 17,700 and 18,200 in January before a report from US short-seller Hindenburg on the Adani Group stocks triggered a sell-off. The majority of Adani Group stocks surged for a second straight day, with the flagship Adani Enterprises and a top gainer in the metal index, closing 20% higher. Financial stocks did not gain as much on the central bank's decision, as an indication of more future rate hikes could hurt loan demand, analysts said. An overnight rally in tech-heavy Nasdaq helped domestic IT stocks advance 1.53%.

Paytm's loan distribution business jumps four-fold in Jan,08 February,"Fintech startup Paytm on Wednesday said its loan distribution business witnessed four-fold growth in January over the same period last year, with disbursements worth Rs 3,928 crore (nearly $480 million) last month. As compared to the previous month, the value has grown sequentially from Rs 3,665 crore ($443 million) loans disbursed in December.  The company disbursed about 3.9 million loans last month, more than double of the number of loans it disbursed in January 2022, it said in an exchange filing. Paytm provides loans to its customers and merchant partners in partnerships with non-banking finance companies (NBFCs) such as Clix Capital, Aditya Birla Finance, Piramal Finance, Fullerton India and Hero FinCorp. It earns a commission based on the loans it issues to Paytm postpaid users and merchants. One of India’s biggest payments firm, which turned operationally profitable (on the basis of adjusted Ebitda) last quarter, has gained about 28% in the last five days, hitting the upper limit of 20% on Tuesday. The development comes as the firm, led by its founder Vijay Shekhar Sharma, has been trying to minimise its cash burn and achieve profitability through most of last year. The Noida-based firm said it has also expanded its user base reporting 89 million average monthly transacting users at the end of the month, up about 29% on a yearly basis. The number has grown from 85 million at the end of December 2022. It added another 0.3 million merchants for its payment devices subscription, taking the total to 6.1 million users. The fintech firm provides these devices or soundboxes to its merchant partners on a subscription basis. This business, while deriving subscription revenues and higher payment volumes, acts as a funnel for the company’s loan distribution business. Further, the gross merchandise volume processed by merchants on its platform grew by 44% on a year-on-year basis to Rs 1.2 lakh crore ($15 billion) in January. Paytm said over the last few quarters it has been focusing on payment volumes that generate profitability for us, either through net payments margin or from direct upsell potential. Operated by One97 Communications, it reported an Ebitda without accounting for employee-stock option costs, of Rs 31 crore over a revenue of operations of Rs 2,062 crore in the third quarter of financial year (FY) 2023, up 42% over the same period last year.  The company widened its consolidated loss to Rs 392.1 crore for the December 2022 quarter, compared to Rs 778.5 crore in the quarter before. Share article on",https://www.vccircle.com//paytms-loan-distribution-business-jumps-four-fold-in-jan,Finance,"One of India’s biggest payments firm, which turned operationally profitable (on the basis of adjusted Ebitda) last quarter, has gained about 28% in the last five days, hitting the upper limit of 20% on Tuesday.Operated by One97 Communications, it reported an Ebitda without accounting for employee-stock option costs, of Rs 31 crore over a revenue of operations of Rs 2,062 crore in the third quarter of financial year (FY) 2023, up 42% over the same period last year.",[],"['nearly $480 million', '$443 million', '$15 billion']"

Now PhonePe allows users for cross-border transactions via UPI,07 February,"Digital payments platform PhonePe on Tuesday said it has launched support for cross-border payments through unified payments interface (UPI), allowing Indian travellers to instantly pay foreign merchants using its network. The current launch supports UPI payments at all international merchant outlets in UAE, Singapore, Mauritius, Nepal and Bhutan that have a local QR code, PhonePe said in a statement.   This year, NPCI (National Payments Corporation of India) in collaboration with NIPL (NPCI International Payments Limited) plans to roll out UPI International to more countries. The organisation is also working on bringing better merchant acceptance in the international regions where this feature is currently live. With the newly launched feature, Indian customers can now use their bank account to pay using UPI. Users will be able to make payments in foreign currency directly from their banks in the same way they do transactions with their international debit cards.  PhonePe users can activate their UPI-linked bank account for UPI international at the merchant location, or prior to their international trip, via the PhonePe App. Customers will need to enter their UPI pin in order to activate the service, the statement added.  “Over the past six years, all over India we have been lucky to experience the UPI payments revolution transforming our daily lives. UPI international is the first major step in letting the rest of the world experience UPI too.

Paytm share price rallies for second day in row,07 February,"One 97 Communications aka Paytm share price extended its rally for a second consecutive day on Tuesday. In early trade, the stock struck a 20% upper circuit. While the stock has skyrocketed by over 27% in 2 days. Major brokerages globally have raised their target price for Paytm shares after strong Q3 numbers. Paytm shares are seen to clock triple-digit percentage upside ahead. At the time of writing, Paytm shares soared by 9.81% or ₹54.75 to trade at ₹612.75 apiece on BSE. Its market cap is around ₹39,787.96 crore. Earlier today, in early trade, Paytm shares hit its 20% upper circuit of ₹669.60 apiece. Paytm shares have kicked started the week with a bang post Q3. On Monday, the share price closed at ₹558 apiece up by 6.31% on Dalal Street. So far, in the week, the shares have climbed by at least 27.55% on D-Street.  The digital financial services provider's consolidated net loss narrowed sharply to ₹392 crore in December 2022 quarter against the loss of ₹778.4 crore in the same period a year ago. Meanwhile, revenue climbed 42% to ₹2,062.2 crore in Q3FY23 versus ₹1,456.1 crore in Q3FY22, driven by increased adoption by consumers and subscription services by merchant partners along with sustained growth seen in loan distribution and commerce business. Paytm founder and CEO Vijay Shekhar Sharma said the company during the December quarter has achieved its target for operational profit, excluding ESOP cost. The fintech achieved an operating profitability milestone with EBITDA before ESOP cost at ₹31 Crore, significantly ahead of its guided timeline of September 2023. Brokerages such as Citi, CLSA, and Goldman Sachs have recommended buying Paytm stock post-Q3FY23 earnings, while BofA maintained its 'neutral' rating on the stock. Majority of brokerages raise target price in Paytm: In its report, CLSA analysts said, ""Paytm had a strong performance in 3QFY23 as it posted positive Ebitda (ex of ESOP costs), beating its own guidance of break-even by Sep-23 by a margin of three quarters. Moreover, the company did not record any UPI incentive in 3QFY23, unlike 3Q22, implying that the Rs1.3bn top-line guidance for 4QFY23 is already confirmed above the normal run rate. Thus, the positive Ebitda journey is likely to be sustained."" Also, CLSA added, ""Net payment margin (ex of subscription revenue) was largely stable at 8bp QoQ on an adjusted basis. The lending segment posted a robust 28% QoQ growth in revenue on the back of strong execution. Commerce revenue also surprised positively, up 50% QoQ with a strong seasonal push."" Post strong Q3 numbers, CLSA is upbeat on the fintech giant. On the valuation, it said, ""the merchant device subscription business saw sustained business as Paytm added 1 million devices in 3QFY23, in line with its prior guidance. We raise our Ebitda ex-ESOP costs estimates by 14-20% for FY25-26CL and our DCF-based target price increases to Rs750, implying a 43% upside. We lower risk-free rate as per our fresh country macro estimates and lower cost of equity. We reiterate our BUY rating."" With fixed costs reined in, margins can comfortably continue to expand Citi's note said, ""Our SOTP implies 36x EV/Adj EBITDA on Mar’26E. The stock trades at 16x, cheap in our view given growth trends and the solid profitability ‘beat’ this Q, with potential for strong profitability trajectory ahead (Fig 14). On a relative basis, the stock trades at a substantial discount to Indian consumer internet peers (Paytm at 16x vs Zomato/Nykaa at 20x/27x on FY26E EV/Adj EBITDA). Buy."" Citi has raised its target price on Paytm to ₹1,061 per share from earlier ₹1,055 per share. Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs expects investors' debates to be centered around Paytm’s ability to maintain industry-leading growth rates while sustaining credit metrics, and if margins can continue to expand from here on. Currently, Paytm’s valuation multiples are at a discount to peers. While maintaining a 'Buy' rating, Golman raised its FY24/FY25 adjusted EBITDA estimates for Paytm by 30%/14% on the back of significantly stronger 3QFY23 (Dec ’22) results, and target price to Rs1,150 (from Rs1,120). ""Not only do we expect profits to sustain, but with continued strong traction in disbursals, operating leverage, and UPI reimbursement in Mar ’23, we expect adjusted EBITDA margin to expand to 6% in Mar ‘23 (vs +2% in Dec ’22), with c.US$190 mn in adjusted EBITDA by FY25, one of the highest within our India internet coverage. We see Paytm reporting adjusted EBITDA profitability as a significant catalyst for the stock, and expect net income profitability in FY25,"" Goldman's note said. On the other hand, BofA Securities has a 'Neutral' recommendation on Paytm. Its note said, ""we are optimistic on fundamentals and see room for Paytm to scale up aggressively without taking any balance sheet risks. While Paytm has key differentiating factors versus peers, overall given higher competition & additional regulatory risks, we expect slower path to monetization leading to delayed EBITDA breakeven. In our view, the lending business provides an upside optionality to Paytm giving Paytm room to scale up subject to execution.""Share article on",https://www.vccircle.com//paytmshare-price-rallies-for-second-day-in-row,Finance,"Majority of brokerages raise target price in Paytm: In its report, CLSA analysts said, ""Paytm had a strong performance in 3QFY23 as it posted positive Ebitda (ex of ESOP costs), beating its own guidance of break-even by Sep-23 by a margin of three quarters.""Not only do we expect profits to sustain, but with continued strong traction in disbursals, operating leverage, and UPI reimbursement in Mar ’23, we expect adjusted EBITDA margin to expand to 6% in Mar ‘23 (vs +2% in Dec ’22), with c.US$190 mn in adjusted EBITDA by FY25, one of the highest within our India internet coverage.","['CLSA', 'ESOP', 'UPI']","['54.75', '612.75', '39,787.96', '669.60', '778.4', '2,062.2', '1,456.1']"
"PayU's LazyPay, Kissht blocked after IT Ministry's order",07 February,"Digital lending platforms LazyPay and Kissht were impacted by the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology’s (MeitY) latest move banning 94 mobile apps with links to China, with some customers losing access. Websites of PayU’s buy-now-pay-later platform LazyPay as well as loan provider Kissht were not working on major telecom networks, following the IT Ministry’s order on 5 February.“The website has been blocked as per the order of the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology under the IT Act, 2000,” LazyPay’s website read. In response to VCCircle’s queries, a company spokesperson said that its website and app are currently unavailable via a few internet service providers. “Please be assured that we are doing everything to resolve the issue,"" the spokesperson added. On the other hand, Kissht’s founder Ranvir Singh said that its app and website are working fine for its customers but noted a Play Store notification related to Kissht. ""The Kissht app and website are working for its customers. We are aware that Google has been asked to take down a list of companies from the Play Store that includes our company, but uncertain about the cause of such a notification. We are meeting officials tomorrow to seek clarification,"" he added. Singh also pointed out that “Kissht has no Chinese stakeholders.” Also, South African holding company Naspers owns PayU. Several LazyPay and Kissht users, who were unable to pay their dues due to the unavailability of platforms, took to Twitter to show their resentment. “I have an overdue of Rs 1867 but you have blocked me from opening my Lazypay application and even blocked me from your website and I'm trying to repayment thought sms links but it's not working because you have blocked me from all the sources tell me how should I pay?” pointed out a LazyPay user. In the past few years, the Indian government has tightened its noose on digital lending platforms, particularly those with links to China. Illegal recovery practices being deployed by loan sharks have pushed the regulators to frame policies safeguarding Indian borrowers. For instance, last year, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) came up with its digital lending guidelines to ensure that the lending platforms maintain transparency with their borrowers and NBFC partners. The regulator has also recently issued advisories to respective state governments to use their respective law enforcement agencies for keeping a tab on unauthorised digital lending platforms and apps.Share article on",https://www.vccircle.com//payus-lazypay-kissht-blocked-after-it-ministry-s-order,Finance,"Websites of PayU’s buy-now-pay-later platform LazyPay as well as loan provider Kissht were not working on major telecom networks, following the IT Ministry’s order on 5 February.“The website has been blocked as per the order of the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology under the IT Act, 2000,” LazyPay’s website read.“I have an overdue of Rs 1867 but you have blocked me from opening my Lazypay application and even blocked me from your website and I'm trying to repayment thought sms links but it's not working because you have blocked me from all the sources tell me how should I pay?” pointed out a LazyPay user.","['Kissht', 'the IT Ministry’s', 'the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology', 'LazyPay', 'LazyPay']",[]

"Markets fall on rate fears, foreign investor selloff",06 February,"Markets closed lower on Monday, dragged by tech stocks after a strong US jobs report renewed fears of the Federal Reserve sustaining aggressive rate hikes for longer, while foreign investors continued to sell. The Nifty 50 index closed 0.50% lower at 17,764.60, while the S&P BSE Sensex fell 0.55% to 60,506.90. Thirty-four of the Nifty 50 constituents declined, with Divi's Laboratories extending losses after reporting lesser-than-expected consolidated net profit in the third quarter, on Friday. Metals fell 2.20%, and was the top sectoral loser, while high weightage financials and information technology stocks also declined. Wall Street equities fell on Friday after nonfarm payrolls rose by 517,000 jobs in January, way above a Reuters estimate of 185,000. The strong report heightened fears that the Fed might continue its rate hike trajectory, with interest rate futures now pointing to chances of the central bank delivering at least two more rate hikes. The IT stocks were down 0.61%, trimming some of the intraday losses amid rate-hike concerns in the United States that could push the economy into a recession. The index was down 1.34% earlier in the session. IT companies in the country draw the bulk of their revenue from clients in the United States. A potential slowdown in the world's largest economy could hobble their growth prospects. However, there was limited downside as technology stocks were trading at attractive valuations, analysts said. Meanwhile, the uncertainty in Adani stocks had created panic in Indian markets.

Adani sell-off extends; India's opposition lawmakers launch protests,06 February,"Lawmakers of India's main opposition party kicked off planned protests at some state-run companies on Monday over the crisis at Adani group, whose seven listed firms saw another sell-off that drove their market loss to $112 billion in under two weeks. Members of the Congress party plan to protest outside several offices of state-owned insurer Life Insurance Corporation (LIC) and State Bank of India (SBI), both of which have exposure to Adani group companies. At one of the protest sites in Mumbai, people held up banners with the words ""Save SBI"", television footage showed. The crisis was triggered by US-based short-seller Hindenburg Research's January 24 report that accused the Adani group of stock manipulation, unsustainable debt and use of tax havens. The Adani group, one of India's top conglomerates, has rejected the criticism and denied wrongdoing in detailed rebuttals, but that has failed to arrest the unabated fall in its shares. In the brutal fallout of Hindenburg's report, Adani group flagship company Adani Enterprises Ltd was forced to abandon a $2.5 billion share sale last week, and group chairman Gautam Adani lost his crown as Asia's richest person and slipped down the global rankings of the wealthy. Gautam Adani and India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi are from the same state. Adani has denied allegations by Modi's opponents that he had benefited from their close ties, and Modi's government has denied allegations of favouring Adani. As the Adani shares spiralled lower and cast a pall over Indian markets last week, lawmakers disrupted parliament and demanded an inquiry. The stock market rout triggered a series of credit ratings warnings on Friday with Moody's saying the group may struggle to raise capital, and S&P cutting its outlook on two group companies. Even attempts by regulators and the government to calm spooked investors do not appear to be working. The Reserve Bank of India said on Friday the country's banking system remains resilient and stable. India's market regulator said on Saturday the country's financial markets remain stable and continue to function in a transparent and efficient manner. SBI said on Friday it was not concerned about the exposure to the Adani group, but further financing to its projects would be ""evaluated on its own merit"". India's divestment secretary Tuhin Kanta Pandey told Reuters on Friday that LIC shareholders and customers should not be concerned about its exposure to the Adani group. LIC has a 4.23% equity stake in the flagship Adani Enterprises, while its other exposures include a 9.14% stake in Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone. Shares of Adani Enterprises sank 9.6% on Monday, taking its market capitalisation losses to nearly $28 billion since the release of the short-seller's report. Adani Transmission Ltd dropped 10%, while Adani Green Energy Ltd, Adani Total Gas Ltd, Adani Power, and Adani Wilmar fell roughly 5%. Adani Ports was the only stock to buck the trend, rising 1.2%.Share article on",https://www.vccircle.com//adanisell-off-extends-india-s-opposition-lawmakers-launch-protests,Finance,"The Adani group, one of India's top conglomerates, has rejected the criticism and denied wrongdoing in detailed rebuttals, but that has failed to arrest the unabated fall in its shares.In the brutal fallout of Hindenburg's report, Adani group flagship company Adani Enterprises Ltd was forced to abandon a $2.5 billion share sale last week, and group chairman Gautam Adani lost his crown as Asia's richest person and slipped down the global rankings of the wealthy.","['Adani', 'Adani Enterprises Ltd']","['$112 billion', '$2.5 billion', 'nearly $28 billion']"

‘Angel tax ends pref treatment of foreigners',03 February,"The return of angel tax is nothing but an attempt to level the playing field for domestic investors which is currently tilted in favour of foreign entities, a top government official said.The Union budget for 2023-24 has proposed to bring foreign investors within the ambit of angel tax, which is applied on the premium to the fair market value of a company’s shares when it raises capital. The move has raised fears in the investor and startup communities that it would worsen the ongoing funding crunch, especially given that foreign private equity and venture capital investments in Indian startups fell to $54 billion in 2022 from $77 billion the previous year.“There is no angel tax on startups. Let me be clear. (Section) 56.2 (VII B) used to have two provisions. One was the preferential treatment of foreign players. Preferential treatment has been done away with. But for startups, there is no change. A DPIIT-recognized startup will not attract angel tax if investment is made into that,” Anurag Jain, secretary, Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) said at a press conference.Alternative investment funds (AIFs) registered with the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) will remain exempt from the tax, but domestic investors not registered with Sebi must pay it, unless the startup they invest in claims certain exemptions.“It was a preferential treatment for foreigners compared to domestic (investors). Is that the right thing to do? You want to treat foreigners more preferentially compared to domestic players? Why should we not give a level playing field?,” Jain added.Jain cited an example of a cup, which is valued at Rs 100. “I give it (the cup) to you and you give me Rs 1,000. The underlying asset does not have the value of what you are giving. This can be used for doing hawala businesses,” he said, defending the premise of Section 56.2 (VII B).Jain said that there were sufficient guard rails to ensure that this is not aimed at startups.“We all understand that people invest in startups for their potential. Today, it may not be valued. But they know that it will be valued like this after a while; so, therefore theyinvest. There is a proviso that this is not attracted for startups,” Jain added.The industry though, says the law covers a large number of startups and investors on a practical level, which will likely worsen.Only 84,000 startups are registered by the DPIIT, leaving out a large part of the ecosystem. There are strict conditions for those claiming angel tax exemptions: They will not be allowed to conduct a variety of business activities for seven years after they cease to be startups. Such activities include creating subsidiaries or advancing of loans, or stock M&A, which are routine exercises for many companies. Further, those who have received an angel tax notice typically find it hard to raise subsequent rounds of capital, as new investors worry if whether the funding would be used towards pay off tax demands.The budget proposal has much ramifications beyond the startup community, Subramaniam Krishnan, a partner at EY said.“Sellers will price the fund-raise depending on the demand. If it is an attractive asset, which gets multiple investors, a valuation exercise is also an exercise in price discovery. There are multiple variables and future projections used while calculating valuation based on discounted cash flow model. On a practical level, we have noticed that tax officers tend to challenge the valuation provided by companies, issuing notices asking for justification,” he said.Subramaniam added that companies would need to now balance between the foreign exchange management act (FEMA) and Section 56.2(VII B).“The pricing guidelines under FEMA sets the floor price for the valuation, while Section 56.2 VII B sets the cap,” he said.Share article on",https://www.vccircle.com//angeltaxends-pref-treatment-of-foreigners,Finance,"The return of angel tax is nothing but an attempt to level the playing field for domestic investors which is currently tilted in favour of foreign entities, a top government official said.The Union budget for 2023-24 has proposed to bring foreign investors within the ambit of angel tax, which is applied on the premium to the fair market value of a company’s shares when it raises capital.A DPIIT-recognized startup will not attract angel tax if investment is made into that,” Anurag Jain, secretary, Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) said at a press conference.Alternative investment funds (AIFs) registered with the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) will remain exempt from the tax, but domestic investors not registered with Sebi must pay it, unless the startup they invest in claims certain exemptions.“It was a preferential treatment for foreigners compared to domestic (investors).","['Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT', 'AIFs', 'the Securities and Exchange Board of India']","['$54 billion', '$77 billion']"
No cash appraisals at Unacademy this year: CEO,02 February,"SoftBank-backed edtech unicorn Unacademy will not offer cash appraisals to employees this year, co-founder and chief executive officer (CEO) Gaurav Munjal said in an internal email reviewed by VCCircle.
The company has instead decided to award stock options based on individual performance. The reason cited for the lack of cash appraisals is to focus on profitability.   ""We must continue to focus on profitability because when Unacademy does an IPO, it should do it with at least 4 quarters of profitability, ' Munjal said in an internal note issued today.Unacademy's announcement comes shortly after its larger peer Byju's fired close to 1,500 staff in a bid to inch closer towards profitability.Unacademy was last valued at around $3.4 bn in August 2021 when it raised $440 million from investors including Temasek and Softbank.   Munjal added that Unacademy's burn has significantly come down and expects 2023 to be a good year for the company. Its new businesses, especially offline centres, are expected to show a lot of growth, he said.“I know this is disheartening to hear after putting in a lot of hard work, but I want you all to understand that this is a phase. We have built great products. We have been great at adapting to market conditions. We launched new businesses and did not decline when everyone else did. And our Ebitda (earnings before interest, tax and ammortization) margin has improved a lot,” Munjal noted.  An email sent to Unacademy did not elicit a response.The development comes after Unacademy’s upskilling product Relevel shifted focus from the education business to the tests product app, resulting in the layoff of 40 employees.   The unicorn, itself, fired about 10% of its workforce or about 350 employees in November last year, in its last round of layoffs during the year, crushing under the edtech sector’s woes amid a reopening of schools, weak macroeconomic conditions and a funding winter.   During its earlier round of layoffs in June 2022, when it fired about 150 employees, the firm’s chief executive Gaurav Munjal assured that the edtech company won’t conduct any more layoffs during the year. However, in November, the CEO said, “the market challenges have forced us to re-evaluate our decisions. Funding has significantly slowed down and a large portion of our core business has moved offline.”  In April last year, it sacked about 600-800 employees from its sales and marketing team, along with a few contractual staff and educators or tutors. It had also sacked about 100 employees from PrepLadder team amid a restructuring of the organization.    Share article on",https://www.vccircle.com//nocash-appraisals-at-unacademy-this-year-ceo,Finance,"""We must continue to focus on profitability because when Unacademy does an IPO, it should do it with at least 4 quarters of profitability, ' Munjal said in an internal note issued today.Unacademy's announcement comes shortly after its larger peer Byju's fired close to 1,500 staff in a bid to inch closer towards profitability.Unacademy was last valued at around $3.4 bn in August 2021 when it raised $440 million from investors including Temasek and Softbank.The unicorn, itself, fired about 10% of its workforce or about 350 employees in November last year, in its last round of layoffs during the year, crushing under the edtech sector’s woes amid a reopening of schools, weak macroeconomic conditions and a funding winter.","['IPO', 'Temasek and Softbank', 'edtech']","['around $3.4', '$440 million']"

Budget 2023: Multiple misses for HNIs offset joy of lower taxes,02 February,"Despite the Union Budget 2023 proposing to lower India's highest income tax rate, high-net investors (HNIs) are finding themselves in hot soup, owing to at least four new changes put forward by the government with the Finance Bill 2023. To begin with, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman, while presenting the annual Budget on Wednesday, proposed a capping deduction from capital gains on investment in residential houses under sections 54 and 54F of the Income Tax Act to Rs 10 crore. For the unversed, sections 54 and 54F allowed a deduction on the capital gains if the assessee reinvested the gains in residential properties in a defined time grade. Prior to the Budget 2023 announcement, there was no limit on how much dedication an individual can claim under sections 54 and 54F. The amendments in both sections will take effect from 1 April, 2024.HNIs and UHNIs would utilize this avenue to reduce their capital gains tax liability, pointed out Vishal Yeole, vice president of business advisory services at Waterfield Advisors.“The original intent of these exemption sections always had been to incentivize the Housing Sector and mitigate the shortage of housing. It was felt that the exemptions were not achieving the intended purpose and it is now proposed to substantially limit the arbitrage available on capital gains tax arising to HNIs/UHNIs,” Yeole added. Another setback for HNIs is that the Union Budget 2023 proposed that market-linked debentures (MLDs) will now be taxed as short-term capital gains irrespective of the holding period. MLDs are listed securities which are quasi-debt and quasi-equity in nature. HNIs invested in MLDs not just for their returns, but because of the tax treatment they attracted, said Vaibhav Gupta, partner at tax and regulatory consulting firm Dhruva Advisors. Gains from the asset class so far attracted a 10% tax as they were considered long-term capital gains (LTCG). However, with the latest proposition, gains from MLDs will be taxed as short-term capital gains (STCG) at about 15%. Meanwhile, Budget 2023 also proposed that the government will now levy tax on high-premium insurance plans issued on or after 1 April 2023. The taxes will be able on policies, whose yearly premium is above Rs 5 lakh. Since mostly HNIs were subscribers to these plans, they are likely to be hit the most. The final nail in the coffin is for HNIs who are non-residents and count themselves as startup investors,  is the expansion of the ‘angel tax’ beyond domestic investors. Non-residents will now come under the purview of Section 56(2) VII B, better known as ‘angel tax’, which is applied if the share price that is allotted to investors is at a premium to the fair market value (FMV) of the share. On the other hand, possibly the only hit from Union Budget 2023 for HNIs was the reduction in the highest income tax rate from 42.74% to 39% under the new scheme of Income tax. “This would see increased adoption of the new tax regime for individuals,” said Dhruva Advisors’ Gupta, adding that it will benefit high-income bracket founders and professionals who can save taxes on their employee stock options (Esops).  “The highest tax rate on personal income has also been brought down to address concerns on flight of HNIs,” said Ranen Banerjee - Partner and Leader, Economic Advisory Services, PwC India.Share article on",https://www.vccircle.com//budget2023-multiple-misses-for-hnis-offset-joy-of-lower-taxes,Finance,"The amendments in both sections will take effect from 1 April, 2024.HNIs and UHNIs would utilize this avenue to reduce their capital gains tax liability, pointed out Vishal Yeole, vice president of business advisory services at Waterfield Advisors.“The original intent of these exemption sections always had been to incentivize the Housing Sector and mitigate the shortage of housing.On the other hand, possibly the only hit from Union Budget 2023 for HNIs was the reduction in the highest income tax rate from 42.74% to 39% under the new scheme of Income tax.","['Waterfield Advisors', 'the Housing Sector', 'Union Budget 2023']",[]
Adani Ent withdraws FPO citing investor interest,02 February,"The Board of Adani Enterprises Ltd., (AEL) after a meeting late on Wednesday night decided to withdraw the company’s Rs 20,000 crore follow-on public offering (FPO) citing protection of investor interests. The company is working on returning investor funds lying in an escrow account. Almost half of the Rs 20,000 crore will be returned. “The Board of Adani Enterprises Ltd., (AEL) decided not to go-ahead with the fully subscribed Follow-on Public Offer (FPO),"" the company said in an announcement to the stock exchanges.  “ Given the unprecedented situation and the current market volatility the Company aims to protect the interest of its investing community by returning the FPO proceeds and withdraws the completed transaction.”  “The subscription for the FPO closed successfully yesterday,"" said Gautam Adani, Chairman, Adani Enterprises. ""Despite the volatility in the stock over the last week, your (investors) faith and belief in the Company, its business and its management has been extremely reassuring and humbling..... However, today the market has been unprecedented, and our stock price has fluctuated over the course of the day. Given these extraordinary circumstances, the Company’s board felt that going ahead with the issue will not be morally correct.”   The company’s withdrawal comes on a day the Adani Enterprises lost almost 30% in share price, causing a huge blow to institutional investors and family offices who rescued the offer on the last day.    “Anchor and HNI investors, who’ve pumped most of the money into the FPO, have hell to pay for, taking a 30% haircut from Day 1 after the offer closed,” a senior banker affiliated to a foreign bank, said.  “The only way to salvage the situation was by calling off the FPO.”   A senior fund manager termed the withdrawal a “disaster” indicating that the investors in the offering had become “uncomfortable” after the steep price fall. It could also impact the capital raising ability of the group, going forward.   However, group founder Adani added, "" This decision will not have any impact on our existing operations and future plans. We will continue to focus on long term value creation and growth will be managed by internal accruals. Once the market stabilizes, we will review our capital market strategy.”  He added that the company was working with the Book Running Lead Managers (BRLMs) to refund the proceeds “received by us in escrow and to also release the amounts blocked in your bank accounts for subscription to this issue. Our balance sheet is very healthy with strong cashflows and secure assets, and we have an impeccable track record of servicing our debt. ”  Another fund manager said that the withdrawal could result in stemming the price fall in group companies “for now” as also in banks that had exposure to the group. However, he did not rule a “kneejerk” reaction when markets open on Thursday.    A day after the Adani Enterprises FPO was rescued by institutional investor and HNI family office backing, investors dumped frontline group stocks on reports of a Swiss bank refusing to accept Adani Group bonds as collateral for margin loans in light of Hindenburg Research’s allegations of corporate fraud, which the group has contested.   Stocks like Adani Ports, which hit a 52-week low of Rs 459.50, Adani Enterprises, Ambuja Cements, ACC and Adani Total Gas plumbed, erasing a combined Rs 1.84 trn worth of investor wealth in group stocks on Wednesday. The damage over the past five days to the Group’s market cap has been to the tune of Rs 7.56 trn and after Wednesday’s rout cost founder Gautam Adani ceding the richest Indian title to RIL chairman Mukesh Ambani.   Adani slipped to the 15th richest person on the Forbes Billionnaire having seen his networth erode by $14 bn to $74.7bn, led by Adani Enterprises plunging 28.2% to Rs 2135.35 apiece, Adani Ports by a whopping 19.18% to Rs 495.15, Ambuja Cements by 16.72% to Rs 334.10, ACC by 6.19% at Rs 1846.45 and Adani Total Gas by 10% to Rs 1897.40.  The extent of participation in these stocks was borne out by Adani Enterprises being the top traded stock on NSE at Rs 3436 crore, followed by Ambuja Cements and Adani Ports being the third- and fourth most traded stocks by value at Rs 2775 crore and Rs 2536 crore each.   The rout in the frontline Adani stocks had a cascading effect on PSU bank stocks like SBI, Bank of Baroda and PNB which slipped 5 -8%.    The outlook for the Group stocks remained gloomy even after Wednesday’s rout.   ""The investors in Adani Ports, Adani Enterprises, ACC and Ambuja Cements are concerned about the fallout from the Hindenburg report, which has resulted in their rushing for exit all at once,” said one of the fund managers cited above. “The buyers don’t seem to be in a hurry to pick these stocks yet on expectations they can get them at lower value.”  Unlike stocks traded only on the cash market, those traded on both cash and derivatives segments – Adani Ports, Adani Enterprises, ACC and Ambuja Cements -- don’t have any price band, which means their prices can swing more wildly.   After a 10% rise or fall, there is a cooling off period after which the price trading range opens by 5% each either side. A 15% move is followed by another cooling off period and then a 5% range opens again.  Against these price band of Adani Total, Adani Green and Adani Transmission is set at 10% which is the maximum limit they can rise or fall to in a trading session.   The promoter pledge in stocks such as Adani Ports stands at 19.25%, after a further 3.25% was pledged on January  27 and January 31.   The increase in shorting increased to the extent that Ambuja Cements futures and options contracts remain banned for trading in the F&O segment as it has crossed an exchange threshold in terms of number of outstanding shares being held by clients.   Adani Ports has also seen a huge build up in outstanding F&O positions, with clients holding 82% of marketwide position limit, or 12.37 crore shares out of 15 crore shares.    Share article on",https://www.vccircle.com//adanient-withdraws-fpo-citing-investor-interest,Finance,"“ Given the unprecedented situation and the current market volatility the Company aims to protect the interest of its investing community by returning the FPO proceeds and withdraws the completed transaction.”  “The subscription for the FPO closed successfully yesterday,"" said Gautam Adani, Chairman, Adani Enterprises.Given these extraordinary circumstances, the Company’s board felt that going ahead with the issue will not be morally correct.”   The company’s withdrawal comes on a day the Adani Enterprises lost almost 30% in share price, causing a huge blow to institutional investors and family offices who rescued the offer on the last day.","['Company', 'FPO', 'FPO', 'Adani Enterprises', 'Company', 'the Adani Enterprises']","['14', '74.7bn']"
"What the budget missed, according to investors",01 February,"The alternative investment fund (AIF) and the startup industry was largely left disappointed with the proposed Finance Bill 2023,  which left out most of key demands made, including those on tax treatment and legal framework. Instead, startups were unnerved by an ‘angel tax’ for non-residents. “Startups were shocked to hear that ‘Angel Tax’ – the tax payable by a company for issuing shares at a premium above its fair market value, would now apply to investments from non-residents as well. Previously, it only applied to investments from residents. Foreign capital is the largest source of funding for Indian startups and this measure will push many investors to turn hesitant in funding Indian startups. It will also push Indian entrepreneurs to move overseas,” said Siddharth Pai, Co-Founder 3one4 Capital & Co-Chair, Regulatory Affairs Committee, Indian Venture Capital Association (IVCA). Investors were expecting to find mention in the Union Budget 2023 of the suggestions made by Expert Committee on private equity and venture capital (PE/VC) investments. The Committee had tabled its report in December 2022. “Yes, there was a lot of expectation from the VC/PE investor community to see rationalization in capital gains tax to boost capital flows to a space that attracted over $100 billion in investments over the last 6 years. It is a disappointment to have this request denied this year as well,” said Anirudh A Damani, Managing Partner at Artha Venture Fund. ""I strongly advocate for a tax regime to attract foreign capital directly into Indian startups,"" he added. Anil Talreja, Partner at Deloitte India said the fund managers of AIFs (including REITs, Invits) had expected parity on tax rates applicable on interest income distributed by the funds and period of holding to determine long term/short term capital gains. “They were also expecting clarity on taxation on carried interest as well as ‘pass through’ status for CAT III. The proposals to tax potential repayment of debt in the hands of the investors will dampen their spirits and may take them back to the drawing board to structure leverage,” he added.  AIFs have been seeking tax parity between listed and unlisted entities and recognition of AIF operations under Indian Tax law, especially GST. Under the existing tax framework for Mutual Funds, Portfolio Management Services (PMS), REITs/InvITs, the income is taxed in the hands of investors on a “pass through” basis, at tax rates applicable to such investment funds. However, for AIFs, particularly those making public market investments, do not enjoy the pass-through status and gains are taxable at the hands of individual investors. In other words, there is no taxation at the fund level. Funds, therefore, need to rely on other avenues available under the tax laws which are prone to litigation. “Having parity in treatment of securities will increase the capital allocated to investments in new asset creation that generate jobs and boost the economy, said Gopal Srinivasan, Chairman and Managing Director of TVS Capital Funds. ""In the AIF business model, carried interest and management fee requires right recognition and treatment across laws/regulations… we are opposed to holding our securities at a lower cost, even though carried interest is treated as Capital Gains by the industry and there is no clear directive or order instructing the tax assessment officer. So, there is a need to bring in certainty to this aspect to avoid friction across agencies/regulators. The pass-through character permitted to AIFs should be across incomes, losses and expenses instead of restricting it to only incomes/losses, he added.The industry also hoped for extending the ESOP (employee stock option plan) tax changes from the last budget to all the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT)-registered startups and allowing for an objective M&A framework as opposed to going through NCLT or National Company Law Tribunal approval, which is for the large corporates. ""Ease of doing business I think is the only headline (in the Budget) which will indirectly help the investment community,"" Srinivasan added.Share article on",https://www.vccircle.com//whatthe-budget-missed-according-to-investors,Finance,"The proposals to tax potential repayment of debt in the hands of the investors will dampen their spirits and may take them back to the drawing board to structure leverage,” he added.The pass-through character permitted to AIFs should be across incomes, losses and expenses instead of restricting it to only incomes/losses, he added.The industry also hoped for extending the ESOP (employee stock option plan) tax changes from the last budget to all the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT)-registered startups and allowing for an objective M&A framework as opposed to going through NCLT or National Company Law Tribunal approval, which is for the large corporates.","['ESOP', 'the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade', 'National Company Law Tribunal']",['over $100 billion']
Budget 2023: What is the startup ecosystem thinking?,01 February,"The Indian startup ecosystem witnessed multiple new developments on the policy front across various sectors, as finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman tabled the Union Budget for FY23-24 on 1 February.Several sectors like agritech, electric mobility and fintech saw announcements that are widely intended to provide a fillip to hundreds of startups across the nation.For instance, finance minister Sitharaman announced the increase in the carry forward of losses due to a change in shareholding pattern from seven years to 10. She also announced the proposal of setting up 100 labs for developing applications using 5G services in engineering institutions.In order to pave way for more production in electric passenger mobility, the Budget proposed a reduction in the basic customs duty for non-lithium and ion cell batteries utilized in electric vehicles, as part of the government's efforts to promote ‘green growth’ in the 2023 Budget.“The pro-EV Budget focuses on initiatives such as customs duty reduction from 21% to 13% on capital goods and machinery required for lithium batteries and an extension of the subsidies on EV batteries for one more year. This will certainly encourage each EV manufacturer to contribute to government initiatives to achieve mass EV adoption by 2030. This will also encourage investments in the EV sector” said Anmol Bohre, co-founder & managing director of Enigma. In the agriculture and agritech sector, the finance minister announced the proposal to set up an accelerator fund to support agritech startups as well as to encourage entrepreneurship, primarily in rural areas.  Relaying the sentiment of the agritech sector, PC Musthafa, co-founder and chief executive of iD Fresh said, “The proposal to set up the Agriculture Accelerator Fund to encourage startups in rural areas has the potential to be a catalyst for growth."" There was also an increased emphasis on the fintech sector and digital payments infrastructure with the budget proposing an expansion of the scope of documents available in DigiLocker for individuals to enable fintech innovative services. Additionally, business establishments will be required to have a Permanent Account Number (PAN) and the PAN will be used as the common identifier for all digital systems of specified government agencies. In terms of its impact on the fintech sector, Harshil Mathur, co-founder and CEO of Razorpay said, “The move to provide credit guarantee for MSMEs through an allocation of Rs 9,000 crore will empower the growth of small businesses. One of the takeaways from this year’s Budget for the fintech sector is the Data Governance Policy and KYC simplification. The policy will bring in an additional layer of privacy and trust for the ecosystem and enable startups and research entities to safely access non-personal data. Meanwhile, simplification of the KYC process keeping a risk-based approach in mind is in tandem with the needs of India’s digital transformation. Making PAN the common identifier for all online businesses will ease the process of compliance for startups.” Ravi Kumar, co-founder & CEO of Upstox added, “PAN as a common identifier will simplify the KYC process and also enhance ease of doing business. For individuals, the increase in the income tax rebate from ₹5 lakh to ₹7 lakh under the new tax regime will leave more disposable income in the hands of individuals, and thus higher investment potential.” “Budget 2023 will put more money in the hands of mid-income users and that will have a direct impact on consumer spending, especially in the value segment,” said Himanshu Chakrawarti, CEO of Snapdeal while commenting about the budget’s influence on the direct-to-consumer (D2C) sector Prashanth Aluru, co-founder and CEO of TMRW- House of Brands said, “The income tax slab revision is also expected to put more money in the hands of the common man, which will allow growth in the D2C ecosystem. The start-up world is also expected to benefit from the revamped Credit Guarantee Scheme for MSMEs giving a boost to the Atmanirbhar Bharat initiative.” Concerning the infrastructure sector, Mohammad Athar (Saif), partner and leader of industrial development, PwC India said “Focus on 100 infrastructure projects for enabling last mile connectivity will promote the reduction of logistics costs. Upgrading 50 airports will enable connectivity across all major economic clusters. The new fund with an annual allocation of Rs 10,000 crore will provide impetus to the development of urban infrastructure across cities. India’s commitment to a greener world as it transitions to a major economic hub is evident from an outlay of Rs 35,000 crore to the energy transition, with a specific outlay of Rs 19,700 crore for green hydrogen.” Ritesh Agarwal, founder & group CEO, Oyo said, “Increment in the capital investment by 33% in infrastructure and Urban Infrastructure Development Fund (UIDF) will have a multiplier effect. Announcing a capital outlay of Rs 2.4 lakh crore for the railway sector, the addition of 50 airports, heliports, water aerodromes and advanced landing grounds will provide impetus to overall infrastructure, leading to connectivity across the country.” ""The budget's focus on transportation and infra projects with the Urban Infra Development Fund will give a boost to the logistics sector. The revamped credit guarantee scheme for MSMEs and the Rs 9,000 crore infusion amount in the corpus would push the entrepreneurial spirit of the country,"" added Saahil Goel, co-founder & CEO, of logistics unicorn Shiprocket. “The promotion of online learning through Mission Karmayogi and the IGOT platform will drive the adoption of digital technologies, even across rural and remote regions. Another milestone includes the focus on setting up more AI and 5G labs and R&D centres and the need for a skilled talent pool to support this adoption, The Budget's proposal to provide stipend support to over 47 lakh youth is a major move to encourage skilling,” said Mayank Kumar, co-founder, and managing director, upGrad. Share article on",https://www.vccircle.com//budget2023-what-is-the-startup-ecosystem-thinking-,Finance,"She also announced the proposal of setting up 100 labs for developing applications using 5G services in engineering institutions.In order to pave way for more production in electric passenger mobility, the Budget proposed a reduction in the basic customs duty for non-lithium and ion cell batteries utilized in electric vehicles, as part of the government's efforts to promote ‘green growth’ in the 2023 Budget.“The pro-EV Budget focuses on initiatives such as customs duty reduction from 21% to 13% on capital goods and machinery required for lithium batteries and an extension of the subsidies on EV batteries for one more year.For individuals, the increase in the income tax rebate from ₹5 lakh to ₹7 lakh under the new tax regime will leave more disposable income in the hands of individuals, and thus higher investment potential.” “Budget 2023 will put more money in the hands of mid-income users and that will have a direct impact on consumer spending, especially in the value segment,” said Himanshu Chakrawarti, CEO of Snapdeal while commenting about the budget’s influence on the direct-to-consumer (D2C) sector Prashanth Aluru, co-founder and CEO of TMRW- House of Brands said, “The income tax slab revision is also expected to put more money in the hands of the common man, which will allow growth in the D2C ecosystem.","['Budget', 'pro-EV Budget', 'EV', 'Snapdeal', 'House of Brands', 'D2C']",['7']
Five income tax rule reforms announced in Budget,01 February,"During the Union Budget speech in the House, Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Wednesday announced change in income tax slabs, up to ₹7 lakh rebate under new income tax regime.  “Currently, those with income up to ₹5 lakh do not pay any income tax in both old and new tax regimes. I propose to increase the rebate limit to ₹7 lakh in the new tax regime. Thus, persons in the new tax regime, with income up to ` 7 lakh will not have to pay any tax,"" said Finance Minister while presenting Budget 2023. “The new tax regime has got a great boost by the Budget announcements made by the FM. Taxpayers at both ends of the spectrum will be encouraged under the new regime, as there will be no liability upto annual income of 7 lacs on 1 hand & surcharge on annual income above 5 crores has been reduced from 37 to 25% at the high income end,"" said Alok Agrawal, Partner, Deloitte India. Here are the 5 income tax rule changes announced by FM Sitharaman in Budget 2023  1) Tax rebate limit raised to ₹7 lakh from ₹5 lakh Abhishek A Rastogi, Founder of Rastogi Chambers said in simple words, the enhancement of this limit to ₹7 lakh means that the person whose income is less than ₹7 lakhs need not invest anything to claim exemptions and the entire income would be tax-free irrespective of the quantum of investment made by such an individual.  This will result in giving more consumption power to the middle-class income group as they could spend the entire amount of income without bothering too much about investment schemes to take the benefit of exemptions, he added. 2) Changes in Income Tax slabs “I propose to change the tax structure in new  regime by reducing the number of slabs to five and increasing the tax exemption limit to ₹3 lakh,"" said FM Sitharaman. The new tax rates are 0-3 lakh - nil 3-6 lakh - 5% 6-9 lakh- 10% 9-12 lakh - 15% 12-15 lakh - 20% above 15 lakh- 30% The new system will decrease the six income categories to five. “Tax assessors will still be able to choose from the prior regime. Salaried and pensioners: the new system's standard deduction for taxable income exceeding Rs15.5 lakhs is ₹52,500,"" said Amit Gupta, MD, SAG Infotech. 3) For pensioners, the finance minister announced extending the benefit of standard deduction to new tax regime. Each salaried person with an income of ₹15.5 lakh or more will benefit by ₹52,500. 4) Maximum tax, along with surcharge, will be 39% “The highest tax rate which in our country is 42.74 per cent. This is among the highest in the world. I propose to reduce the highest surcharge rate from 37 per cent to 25 per cent in the new tax regime. This would result in reduction of the maximum tax rate to 39 per cent,"" announced FM while presenting Budget 2023. ""Tax rates have been reduced under the new tax regime and the maximum marginal rate drops from 42.74% to 39%,"" said Saraswathi Kasturirangan, Partner, Deloitte India 5) Leave encashment Lastly, the limit of ₹3 lakh for tax exemption on leave encashment on retirement of non-government salaried employees was last fixed in the year 2002, when the highest basic pay in the government was ₹30,000 pm. In line with the increase in government salaries, I am proposing to increase this limit to ₹25 lakh.  New income tax regime to be default regimeAmit Gupta, MD, SAG Infotech said that the new information technology system will act as the default tax regime. Tax assessors will still be able to choose from the prior regime. Salaried and pensioners: the new system's standard deduction for taxable income exceeding Rs.15.5 lakhs is ₹52,500. “The government is actively promoting the new tax regime, which will now be the default tax regime. The basic exemption under this regime has increased to 3 lakhs from 2.5 lakhs. Individual tax payers earning up to ₹7 lakhs will not have to pay taxes as compared to current limit of ₹5 lakhs,"" said Saraswathi Kasturirangan, Partner, Deloitte India. The government in Budget 2020-21 brought in an optional income tax regime, under which individuals and Hindu Undivided Families (HUFs) were to be taxed at lower rates if they did not avail specified exemptions and deductions, like house rent allowance (HRA), interest on home loan, investments made under Section 80C, 80D and 80CCD. Under this, total income up to ₹2.5 lakh was tax exempt. Currently, a 5 per cent tax is levied on total income between ₹2.5 lakh and ₹5 lakh, 10 per cent on ₹5 lakh to ₹7.5 lakh, 15 per cent on ₹7.5 lakh to ₹10 lakh, 20 per cent on ₹10 lakh to ₹12.5 lakh, 25 per cent on ₹12.5 lakh to ₹15 lakh, and 30 per cent on above ₹15 lakh. With effect from April 1, these slabs will be modified as per the Budget announcement. Share article on",https://www.vccircle.com//fiveincome-tax-rule-reforms-announced-in-budget,Finance,"Here are the 5 income tax rule changes announced by FM Sitharaman in Budget 2023  1) Tax rebate limit raised to ₹7 lakh from ₹5 lakh Abhishek A Rastogi, Founder of Rastogi Chambers said in simple words, the enhancement of this limit to ₹7 lakh means that the person whose income is less than ₹7 lakhs need not invest anything to claim exemptions and the entire income would be tax-free irrespective of the quantum of investment made by such an individual.Currently, a 5 per cent tax is levied on total income between ₹2.5 lakh and ₹5 lakh, 10 per cent on ₹5 lakh to ₹7.5 lakh, 15 per cent on ₹7.5 lakh to ₹10 lakh, 20 per cent on ₹10 lakh to ₹12.5 lakh, 25 per cent on ₹12.5 lakh to ₹15 lakh, and 30 per cent on above ₹15 lakh.","['Rastogi Chambers', '₹']","['1 hand &', '52,500', '15.5', '52,500', '42.74 per cent', '37 per cent', '25 per cent', '39 per cent', '52,500', '2.5', '5 per cent', '2.5', '5', '10 per cent', '5', '7.5', '15 per cent', '7.5', '20 per cent', '10', '12.5', '25 per cent', '12.5', '15', '30 per cent']"
Foreign funding in local startups now subject to 'angel tax',01 February,"Indian startups raising capital from foreign investors such as Sequoia Capital, Softbank, Prosus, Tiger Global, Carlyle, KKR and Blackstone, will now have to pay ‘angel tax’, a move that may not only adversely impact funding but also prompt more startups to locate overseas.While announcing the Union Budget on Tuesday, the finance minister said non-residents will now come under the purview of Section 56(2) VII B, better known as ‘angel tax’, which was introduced in 2012 as an anti-abuse measure that was aimed at tax-avoidance.  Alternative investment funds registered with India’s market regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi), however, continue to be exempted from angel tax.This is likely to be challenging for startups that are already reeling under a global funding crunch, as the bulk of the capital raised them is from foreign investors. In 2022, private equity and venture capital funding into India amounted to $54 billion, while it was close to $77 billion in 2021, a record year for Indian firms.  “Non-resident investors were never under the scope of this tax,” Ritesh Kumar, Partner, J Sagar & Associates, said. “We are all hoping that this is a mistake,” he added.  Angel tax is applied if the share price that is allotted to investors is at a premium to the fair market value (FMV) of the share. In this case, the difference is subjected to section 56 (2) VII B. For instance, if the fair market value (of a Re 1 face value share) is Rs 10 apiece, and if the startup allots a share at a premium of Rs 15, then the difference of Rs 5 would be taxed as income at the hand of the startup.Theoretically, this is likely to be more severe in the case of early to growth stage startups – where the divergence is higher between FMV and the price of the share allotted. This divergence is usually less stark in mature-companies.  “So far, startups raising foreign capital were outside the purview of taxes as long as shares were issued in compliance with the Reserve Bank of India’s pricing guidelines on share premium. This proposes to bring into the tax net any amount received by a closely-held company (including start-ups unless they qualify as a venture capital undertaking receiving investment from venture capital fund) from a non-resident towards subscription of shares where the consideration is higher than the fair market value,” Kumar explained.  This could compel more startups to flip overseas, as foreign investors may not want deal with additional tax liability by virtue of their investment in the startup, according to Siddarth Pai, cofounder of VC firm 3one4 Capital. “The re-introduction is completely counterintuitive to the entire move of reverse-flipping. This, in fact, will accelerate flipping overseas,” Pai added.“Angel tax has been the sword of Damocles hanging over the heads of various Indian startups. This had been misapplied to them because all startups end up raising money from investors at a premium and often tax demand would come after one or one-and-a-half years. No investor would touch these startups because any money they put into the startup would actually go towards clearing the older tax liability,” Pai said. He added that this would be taxed for startups under “income from other sources” and corporate tax rate would apply.  This would also apply to domestic investors who are not Sebi-registered AIFs. “If money came in from hypothetically a State Bank of India or LIC into a startup, that would also be liable to tax because they're not Sebi-registered AIFs,” Pai added.To avoid the purview of angel tax, startups can file a “Form 2 Exemption”. However, according to the law, this exemption would prevent the startup from several activities such as not setting up a subsidiary, and not making any advances of salary, rental deposits, or vendor advances. Startups also can't make treasury investments or participate in stock M&A – claiming the exemption would hamper the startup in many ways, according to Pai.Share article on",https://www.vccircle.com//foreignfundingin-local-startups-now-subject-to-angel-tax,Finance,"Indian startups raising capital from foreign investors such as Sequoia Capital, Softbank, Prosus, Tiger Global, Carlyle, KKR and Blackstone, will now have to pay ‘angel tax’, a move that may not only adversely impact funding but also prompt more startups to locate overseas.While announcing the Union Budget on Tuesday, the finance minister said non-residents will now come under the purview of Section 56(2) VII B, better known as ‘angel tax’, which was introduced in 2012 as an anti-abuse measure that was aimed at tax-avoidance.For instance, if the fair market value (of a Re 1 face value share) is Rs 10 apiece, and if the startup allots a share at a premium of Rs 15, then the difference of Rs 5 would be taxed as income at the hand of the startup.Theoretically, this is likely to be more severe in the case of early to growth stage startups – where the divergence is higher between FMV and the price of the share allotted.","['Sequoia Capital', 'KKR', 'Blackstone', 'the Union Budget', 'FMV']","['$54 billion', 'close to $77 billion']"
Ecosystem welcomes Govt's sustainability push in Budget 2023,01 February,"Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman proposed a reduction in the basic customs duty for non-lithium and ion cell batteries utilized in electric vehicles, as part of the government's efforts to promote ‘green growth’ in the 2023 Budget.  The import of capital goods and machinery needed for lithium and ion cells used in EV batteries will now be exempt from customs duty, which is expected to make EVs more affordable. The minister highlighted that this change will result in slight modifications to custom duties, cesses, and surcharges for items like automobiles and motorcycles.  “I propose to provide relief on customs duty on import of certain parts & inputs like camera lens & continue the concessional duty on lithium-ion cells for batteries for another year,"" she said.  The government will be allocating Rs 35,000 crore as priority capital towards energy transition and net zero goals in a bid to boost energy security. The minister also stated it is supporting battery energy storage systems with a capacity of 4,000 MWh (megawatt hour) with viability gap funding.  Rishabh Jain, senior programme lead at Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW) said, “our analysis suggests that the key equipment for battery cell manufacturing is imported and their share is between 65-75% of the overall infrastructure costs. Going forward, the government must aim to acquire critical minerals from overseas and build the capability to process them.”  Jain added that the VGF (viability gap funding) support should however, be leveraged to increase understanding of the technology and application and should not be considered as a continuous tool for support. “Further, the exemption of customs duty for capital goods and machinery for lithium-ion battery manufacturing will reduce the final prices of batteries and make electric vehicles more affordable for consumers.”  The reduction in taxes seems to have received a positive reaction from the EV ecosystem.  Pritesh Mahajan, co-founder and chief executive, Revamp Moto said the reduction in custom duty on lithium-ion cells will help in incentivising the product cost to end consumers, resulting in boosting the sales of EVs. This will be further catalysed by the government’s initiative of a strict scrapping policy.  Varun Goenka, co-founder and CEO of Chargeup had a similarly positive view. “One of the most impactful decisions this time is the extension of customs duty exemption for the import of capital goods and machinery required to produce lithium-ion batteries for EVs in India. This move will reduce the initial capital investment needs of the battery manufacturers and is also likely to make the batteries cheaper as there will be a larger manufacturing base for them.”Goenka noted that by reducing 39,000 compliances, the ease of doing business will be improved in the near term.  An extension of duty concessions on the import of lithium-ion cells for EV batteries has also been granted for an additional year. Additionally, the basic customs duty exemption on raw materials necessary for the production of nickel cathodes utilized in these batteries has been continued.""  The 2023 Budget has emphasized sustainability with the launch of a Rs 2,200 crore Aatmanirbhar clean plan program.  Speaking to VCCircle, Ankit Kedia, the founder of Capital A, an early-stage VC firm focusing on EV and climate said, “This is an indication of the government's commitment to reducing India's estimated total carbon emissions by 1 billion tonnes by the end of the decade.”  “The government's decision to exempt excise duty on GST-paid compressed biogas containment will give a boost to the green mobility sector. Also, custom duty exemption on the import of lithium-ion batteries will continue to focus on the transition to electric mobility. Overall, this Budget will help India achieve its commitment to a low-carbon economy while achieving economic growth at the same time. It is expected that these initiatives will help create employment opportunities as well as attract foreign investment into India's economy,” said Kedia.    The finance minister said the governments are looking to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2070 and reduce the country’s carbon intensity by 45% by 2030.  The government intends to establish a comprehensive sustainable development system encompassing initiatives like electric vehicles, waste management systems, water conservation projects, and solar power plants. Additionally, the budget allocates increased funding for research and development of clean technology solutions, including the establishment of green hydrogen production facilities.Share article on",https://www.vccircle.com//ecosystemwelcomes-govt-s-sustainability-push-in-budget-2023,Finance,"This move will reduce the initial capital investment needs of the battery manufacturers and is also likely to make the batteries cheaper as there will be a larger manufacturing base for them.”Goenka noted that by reducing 39,000 compliances, the ease of doing business will be improved in the near term.Speaking to VCCircle, Ankit Kedia, the founder of Capital A, an early-stage VC firm focusing on EV and climate said, “This is an indication of the government's commitment to reducing India's estimated total carbon emissions by 1 billion tonnes by the end of the decade.”  “The government's decision to exempt excise duty on GST-paid compressed biogas containment will give a boost to the green mobility sector.","['VCCircle', 'Capital A', 'EV']","['4,000 MWh']"
Budget 2023 fails to deliver for startups and investors,01 February,"The Budget speech in India is as keenly followed by the public as any major sporting event. It even engenders the same churn of emotions in the audience, with a clear distinction between the winners and losers. Budget 2023 was no exception. Despite fantastic announcements for agriculture, capital expenditure and the like, Budget 2023 was deafening in its silence on measures for investors and startups.Budget 2022 stated that the “Venture Capital and Private Equity invested more than Rs 5.5 lakh crore last year facilitating one of the largest start-up and growth ecosystem. Scaling up this investment requires a holistic examination of regulatory and other friction. An expert committee will be set up to examine and suggest appropriate measures.""This expert committee was formed in 2022 under the chair of Shri M Damodaran, the ex-SEBI chair. Many investors, Indian and foreign, met the committee and shared their views with the same. The report was tabled with the Ministry of Finance in December, with reports that the key asks of the PE/VC industry found mentioned therein. Thus, anticipation was at an all-time high for investors, who looked forward to policy and tax rationalisations to accelerate investments in a funding winter. None of the major points came out in the Budget 2023 speech.A silver lining is the announcements on GIFT IFSCA. Setting up in GIFT IFSC as an Indian manager was fraught with challenges due to multiple approvals and registrations from disparate parties. The single window clearance from GST, SEZ, Indian Financials services regulators like SEBI, RBI, etc will help ease incorporation and make setting up in GIFT IFSC much easier. Empowering IFSCA with SEZ authority will reduce the dual compliance burden and increase the ease of operations. Acquisition financing by foreign banks based in GIFT, enabling international arbitration, etc will go a long way in making GIFT a truly International Financial Services Centre.Business Trusts like REITS and InVITs saw a loophole in the tax law plugged, wherein certain distributions were tax-free in the hands of the Business Trust and the investor. TDS exemption for interest from listed debentures was also removed and income from market-linked debentures would be taxed as short-erm Capital Gains.Startups looked forward to Budget 2023 hoping to find an outline for Startup India 2.0. Given that this is the last full budget before the elections, many perceived this to be the last opportunity to see long-standing asks come to fruition. Instead, many were surprised by the emergence of an old foe, Angel Tax.Angel Tax or Section 56(2)(viib) of the Income Tax Act, 1961 is an anti-abuse measure introduced in 2012 to prevent the laundering of black money via investments at high premiums into unlisted entities. People would invest at a large premium in unlisted companies, siphon off the funds and sell the shares back at a nominal value. However, since 2016, this has been misapplied to Indian startups who often issue their securities at a premium to investors. Since 2012, the only exemptions to 56(2)(viib) were SEBI-registered AIFs and non-residents.A majority of the funding in the Indian startup ecosystem comes from foreign sources. An analysis of the largest funding rounds in 2022 and 2021 puts Indian investments in the low single digits. Thus, bringing non-residents within the ambit will expose investments from even institutional foreign investors to this Angel Tax. Placing further throttles on capital during a funding winter will break the back of the Indian startup ecosystem. Many entrepreneurs are accelerating their flip to an overseas jurisdiction due to this change.The government announced an exemption framework for “Angel Tax’ via a Form 2 exemption. The exemption applies for 7 years from when the company ceases to be a startup. Companies seeking the angel tax exemption can’t undertake ordinary transactions such as salary advances, stock M&A, creation of a subsidiary, or contribution to an ESOP trust. These restrictions make it impossible for startups to scale or compete globally. A further albatross around the neck of the Indian startup ecosystem is the IMB certification process. The “Inter-Ministerial Board” consists of a group of bureaucrats who need to certify the innovation of a startup before they can avail of any of the startup tax benefits. Out of the 84,000 DPIIT registered startups, less than 1% have IMB certification. The lack of reform of the IMB system is a huge disappointment as all the tax benefits only accrue to IMB-registered startups.The budget had 2 other fiscal announcements for startups.But they are contingent on IMB certification – hence it will not benefit 99% of the DPIIT-registered startups. This is a missed opportunity for Indian startups. Even long-standing asks like ESOP tax reform, extending the previous ESOP changes to all DPIIT registered startups, rationalize capital gains between listed and unlisted securities, haven’t come through.
Online Gaming startups will now see all the winnings paid to their users being subject to TDS from Re 1, with the erstwhile Rs 10,000 threshold not applicable.  Non-fiscal measures such as an agriculture accelerator fund for rural agritech startups and creating digital public infrastructure for agritech companies to empower farmers. Allowing access to anonymized data through the National Data Governance Policy will greatly benefit AI startups in India. Budget 2023 could have been the beginning of Startup India 2.0, but the wait still remains.

Abu Dhabi's IHC to invest $400 mn in Adani FPO,30 January,"Adani Enterprises’ struggling ₹20,000 crore share sale received a surprise boost on Monday, with International Holding Co. (IHC), the investment firm of Abu Dhabi’s ruling family, agreeing to invest $400 million in the company amid a $70 billion rout in Adani group stocks. In a statement, IHC said it subscribed to 16% of Adani Enterprises’ follow-on public offering (FPO) through its subsidiary, Green Transmission Investment Holding RSC Ltd. The statement came even as several Adani group stocks continued their downward slide for the third straight day. Including anchor investors and IHC bid, the offer has seen overall demand of ₹9,608 crore as of the second day, against a book size of ₹19,861 crore, leaving a shortfall of ₹10,252.6 crore that needs to be brought in on the final day of the offer. IHC’s investment arrives at a critical time as Adani tries to reinvigorate the offering after US-based short-seller Hindenburg Research alleged that the group committed accounting fraud and stock manipulation through a maze of shell companies in tax haven jurisdictions. On Monday, Adani Enterprises’ shares rose 3.93% to ₹2,869.85 on BSE, recouping some of the losses. But the stock is still trading below the FPO price range of between ₹3,112 and ₹3,276. Retail investors will get an additional ₹64 discount per share. “The IHC bid will boost the Street’s confidence in the FPO. This will cover a substantial part of the institutional book and provide comfort to other institutional investors as well as HNI and retail investors,"" said an investment banker, speaking on the condition of anonymity. Data from NSE shows that the retail investor and HNI categories subscribed by 4% each at the end of the second day. In an interview on Sunday, Adani Group chief financial officer Jugeshinder Singh evinced confidence in the group’s ability to close its share sale successfully, even as he admitted that the Hindenburg episode is likely to dent the participation of retail and HNI investors. “We have the information based on our roadshow. And we are confident about that,"" he said. “We believe there will be significantly less participation (retail and HNI). But once you have institutional participation, how retail behaves and how HNIs behave is a different matter. From an FPO point of view, it is not a relevant factor as to which category is investing how much. What matters is that the total FPO gets subscribed,"" he added. Ahead of the FPO opening for public subscription, the company had raised ₹5,984.9 crore by selling shares to anchor investors at a price of ₹3,276 apiece, the upper end of the price range. Adani plans to allocate ₹10,869 crore from the FPO towards capex for its subsidiaries’ green hydrogen projects and existing airports, as well as the construction of a greenfield expressway. Additionally, ₹4,165 crore will be used to repay debt, partially or in full, for Adani Airport Holdings, Adani Road Transport, and Mundra Solar. This is not the first investment by IHC in Adani Group. Last year, IHC invested $2 billion in three Adani firms: Adani Enterprises, Adani Green and Adani Transmission. “Our interest in Adani Group is driven by our confidence and belief in the fundamentals of Adani Enterprises; we see a strong potential for growth from a long-term perspective and added value to our shareholders,"" said Syed Basar Shueb, chief executive officer, IHC. Share article on",https://www.vccircle.com//abudhabi-s-ihc-to-invest-400-mn-in-adani-enterprises-fpo,Finance,"Including anchor investors and IHC bid, the offer has seen overall demand of ₹9,608 crore as of the second day, against a book size of ₹19,861 crore, leaving a shortfall of ₹10,252.6 crore that needs to be brought in on the final day of the offer.In an interview on Sunday, Adani Group chief financial officer Jugeshinder Singh evinced confidence in the group’s ability to close its share sale successfully, even as he admitted that the Hindenburg episode is likely to dent the participation of retail and HNI investors.","['IHC', 'Adani Group', 'HNI']","['20,000', '$400 million', '$70 billion', '9,608', '19,861', '2,869.85', 'between ₹3,112', '5,984.9', '4,165', '$2 billion']"
"Zoho's FY22 top, bottomlines grow on higher sales of main software",30 January,"Zoho Corporation has posted a rise of 43.3% in its net profit to Rs 2,748.8 crore in the FY22, from Rs 1,917.7 crore in the previous fiscal, as per the company’s latest financials available with the Registrar of Companies (RoC). The software-as-a-service (SaaS) major also posted a 28.3% rise in its revenue to Rs 6,710.8 crore in FY22 from Rs 5,229.6 crore in the previous year, thanks to a sharp rise in sales of its primary software product Zoho One. The company’s income from Zoho One jumped 62% to Rs 3,533 crore in FY22, and accounted for about 52.6% of its total revenue from operations. Revenue from enterprise IT management software offerings surged by 4.1% to Rs 3,158 crore in the last fiscal. It also made Rs 20 crore from software updates and maintenance and support licences. In total, it offers more than 55 enterprise tech platforms. In terms of geographical markets, North America continued to be Zoho’s largest market, from where it made 47.7% of its total income. Europe and Asia were the second and third largest markets, accounting for 22.4% and 13.2% of the total sales, respectively. It also made marginal sales in Africa, Latin America, and Australia. Zoho was founded in 1996 by Sridhar Vembu and Tony Thomas. It currently serves more than 80 million users spread across more than 150 countries. The company remains completely bootstrapped to date.  Going forward, Zoho is sceptical of the growth it achieved in the last fiscal and predicts a slower year-on-year headway for its global business. “Nobody enjoys such growth forever,” Zoho co-founder and chief executive officer (CEO) Sridhar Vembu had said in an interview with VCCircle in November last year. He also predicted it will take at least two years for things to go back to normalcy from here. “The bigger the bubble, the bigger is the burst.” Zoho’s expenditure surged 18% to Rs 3,572 crore in FY22 as compared to the fiscal before. It spent the most on employee benefits at Rs 1,826.8 crore, up 5.9% from Rs 1,725 crore in FY21. The Chennai and Texas-based company has more than 11,000 employees across the world. The company, however, has now slowed down its hiring, owing to the tough macroeconomic conditions. “We’re still hiring but very slowly. But the first thing I want is to ensure that the jobs of our employees are safe,"" Vembu had said. The company’s advertising and promotional costs jumped more than 2x to Rs 715 crore from Rs 335 crore in the fiscal before. However, it is now lowering its marketing costs to mitigate the impact of the unfavourable situation on the software industry. But the company will continue to invest in R&D as it helps in increasing the top-line as well as help it save on energy expenses. It also doesn’t plan to increase the prices of its products and services, at least for now.Share article on",https://www.vccircle.com//zohos-fy22-top-bottomlines-grow-on-higher-sales-of-main-software,Finance,"Zoho Corporation has posted a rise of 43.3% in its net profit to Rs 2,748.8 crore in the FY22, from Rs 1,917.7 crore in the previous fiscal, as per the company’s latest financials available with the Registrar of Companies (RoC).The software-as-a-service (SaaS) major also posted a 28.3% rise in its revenue to Rs 6,710.8 crore in FY22 from Rs 5,229.6 crore in the previous year, thanks to a sharp rise in sales of its primary software product Zoho One.","['Zoho Corporation', 'the Registrar of Companies']",[]

Adani's market loss swells to $66 bn as its fight with short-seller escalates,30 January,"Most Adani group shares extended their sharp falls on Monday as the Indian conglomerate's rebuttal of a US short-seller's criticism failed to pacify investors, driving stock market losses for the companies to $66 billion over three days. Flagship Adani Enterprises, which is facing a crucial test this week with a follow-on share offering, rose 4%, but was off initial gains of as much as 10% and significantly below the offer price. Adani, led by Asia's richest man Gautam Adani, has locked horns with Hindenburg Research and on Sunday hit back at the short-seller's report of last week that flagged concerns about its debt levels and the use of tax havens. Adani said it complies with all local laws and had made the necessary regulatory disclosures. Adani Transmission and Adani Total Gas plunged 20% each on Monday, while Adani Green Energy was down 18%. Adani Power and Adani Wilmar were down 5% each, while Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone slipped 0.5%. Adani Enterprises' $2.5 billion secondary share sale entered its second day amid weak investor sentiment. The stock was trading at 2,892 rupees, far below the price band for the share sale of 3,112-3,276 rupees per share. On Friday, the first day of the offer, the issue was subscribed 1% amid a broader fall in shares. Initial data from stock exchanges on Monday showed Adani has now received bids for 687,840, or 1.5%, of the 45.5 million of shares on offer. The deal closes on Tuesday. Foreign and domestic institutional investors, as well as mutual funds, have made no bids so far, according to the data. ""Retail participation is likely to have a shortfall with current market prices still trailing the offer price and sentiment taking a hit due to the Hindenburg controversy,"" said Hemang Jani, equity strategist at Motilal Oswal Financial Services. ""While there is a risk that the share sale does not go through, it will be crucial today to wait and see how institutional investors participate."" Adani Group told Reuters in a statement on Saturday that the sale remains on schedule at the planned issue price, even as sources said bankers of the country's largest secondary share sale were considering extending the timeline beyond January 31, or tweaking the price due to the fall in its share price. Indian regulations say the share offering must receive minimum subscription of 90%, and if it does not the issuer must refund the entire amount. Maybank Securities and Abu Dhabi Investment Authority are among investors who bid for the anchor portion of the issue. Maybank said in a statement ""there is no financial impact"" as the subscription to Adani’s offer was fully funded by client funds. State-run insurance behemoth, Life Insurance Corporation (LIC), also invested, taking 5% of the anchor portion of around $734 million. It already holds a 4.23% stake in the flagship Adani firm, while its other group exposure includes a 9.14% stake in Adani Ports and 5.96% in Adani Total Gas. Debt, De-leveraging On Saturday, index provider MSCI said it was seeking feedback from market participants on Adani and was monitoring the factors that ""may impact the eligibility of those relevant securities"" in MSCI indexes. There are at least six Adani Group companies in the MSCI India Index, with a cumulative weight of 4.31%. ""The stocks run the risk of getting excluded from the MSCI. This may not immediately happen, but those funds who have bought it based on the MSCI ... their investors will ask them to not continue with the holding and that's where this threat has emerged,"" said Deven Choksey, founder and managing director of KR Choksey Group. The Hindenburg report has led to a massive wipe-out in seven listed companies of the Adani group since last week. As of Monday, the seven listed group entities have collectively lost $66 billion in market capitalisation since the report was released. Adani Total Gas lost the most, at $21 billion. On Monday, responding to Adani’s rebuttal, Hindenburg said the ""response largely confirmed our findings and ignored our key questions."" In its response on Sunday, Adani highlighted its relationships with local and international banks and touted its access to diverse funding sources and structures, listing US banks Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase & Co and European lenders such as BNP Paribas, Credit Suisse and Deutsche Bank. But the continuing stock market meltdown is a dramatic setback for 60-year-old Adani. The school-dropout's stunning rise came with over 1,500% gains in some of his group stocks over three years, making him the world's third richest man before he slipped to rank eighth on the Forbes list on Monday. Hindenburg's report said five of seven key listed Adani companies have reported current ratios, a measure of liquid assets minus near-term liabilities, of below 1 which it said suggested ""a heightened short-term liquidity risk"". It said key listed Adani companies had ""substantial debt"" which has put the entire group on a ""precarious financial footing"" and that shares in seven Adani listed companies have an 85% downside due to what it called ""sky-high valuations"". Adani’s response on Sunday stated that over the past decade, its group companies have ""consistently de-levered"". Share article on",https://www.vccircle.com//adanis-market-loss-swells-to-66-bn-as-its-fight-with-short-seller-escalates,Finance,"Adani, led by Asia's richest man Gautam Adani, has locked horns with Hindenburg Research and on Sunday hit back at the short-seller's report of last week that flagged concerns about its debt levels and the use of tax havens.Adani Group told Reuters in a statement on Saturday that the sale remains on schedule at the planned issue price, even as sources said bankers of the country's largest secondary share sale were considering extending the timeline beyond January 31, or tweaking the price due to the fall in its share price.","['Hindenburg Research', 'Adani Group', 'Reuters']","['$66 billion', '$2.5 billion', 'around $734 million', '$66 billion', '$21 billion']"
Adani Group carnage drives markets to over 3-mnth lows,27 January,"Markets ended more than 1% lower to hit a three-month low on Friday as a short-seller attack on Adani Group companies triggered a selloff in its shares and of the banks, wiping off a combined $48 billion in the conglomerate's market value over two days. The Nifty 50 index was down 1.61% at 17,604.35 at close, while the S&P BSE Sensex fell 1.45% to 59,330.90, trimming some losses in the last few minutes of trading after having hit over 2% lower earlier in the session. The indexes settled more than 2% lower each in the truncated week, their most in a month, after two straight weekly gains. The sell-off in equities was triggered by US short-seller Hindenburg Research's report on Wednesday that flagged concerns about the Adani Group’s debt levels and use of tax havens. Stocks of Adani Transmission and Adani Green Energy tumbled 20% each, while Adani Power dropped 5%, with all three hitting their lower circuit. Adani Enterprises and Adani Ports were the worst performers on the Nifty 50, closing 18.5% and 16.3%, respectively. Heavyweights State Bank of India and ICICI Bank led losses with a decline of 5% and 4.5%, respectively. Adani Enterprises closed at 2,761.45 rupees, well below the lower end of the price band for its $2.45 billion follow-on public offering (FPO). ""It has clearly dented overall investor sentiment. The nervousness has led to a fall in stocks across the board. When a selloff of this kind of magnitude is seen in a very short span of time, investors sell other stocks where they are in the money,"" said Saurabh Jain, assistant vice-president, research, SMC Global Securities. Meanwhile, India's market regulator will study the Hindenburg Research report to add to its own ongoing preliminary investigation into the group's foreign portfolio investors, two sources told Reuters on Friday. Financials sector fell 2.5% to their three-month lows even though brokerages said banks’ exposure to the Adani Group was within manageable limits. Auto stocks were a few bright spots with a 1% rise, with Nifty 50 members Bajaj Auto and Tata Motors advancing 6% each after their strong quarterly results. Share article on",https://www.vccircle.com//adanigroup-carnage-drives-markets-to-over-3-mnth-lows,Finance,"Markets ended more than 1% lower to hit a three-month low on Friday as a short-seller attack on Adani Group companies triggered a selloff in its shares and of the banks, wiping off a combined $48 billion in the conglomerate's market value over two days.The Nifty 50 index was down 1.61% at 17,604.35 at close, while the S&P BSE Sensex fell 1.45% to 59,330.90, trimming some losses in the last few minutes of trading after having hit over 2% lower earlier in the session.","['Adani Group', 'Nifty']","['$48 billion', '$2.45 billion']"
RBI's ban on SBM Bank's forex transactions hurts fintech firms,27 January,"Wealthtech startups Vested Finance and IndMoney have been impacted after the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) had barred SBM Bank (India) Ltd from undertaking outward remittance transactions till further orders. The ban has also hit banking-tech firm Niyo.The RBI, in a directive on January 23, directed the SBM Bank to stop all liberalised remittance scheme (LRS) transactions under sections 35A and 36(1)(a) of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949. The regulator has said that the action is based on “certain material supervisory concerns observed in the bank.” “The bank is engaging with RBI to address certain supervisory concerns at the earliest,” SBM Bank said in a mail to its customers, adding that it remains open for business in all other areas.  The LRS scheme which was introduced on February 4, 2004, allows any Indian resident, including minors, to transfer up to $250,000 abroad in a financial year. On Tuesday, SBM Bank had secured Rs 99 crore from Life Insurance Corporation of India. With the latest round, it has so far raised Rs 224 crore in total funding. Following RBI’s diktat, Vested has temporarily stalled processing fresh deposits for investments via Vested Direct while Tiger Global-backed IndMoney has completely stopped accepting fresh deposits for investments in US stocks.  Vested had partnered with SBM India in October to power its global investment platform Vested Direct. With the ban on SBM, the platform isn’t able to reduce the overall cost of depositing funds to the US brokerage accounts of its customers. It is allowing users to use other existing bank accounts to add funds, which is a rather expensive process.  “We are working hard to provide another low-cost and digital deposit solution on the Vested platform. We will keep you posted on any new updates as soon as we receive them,” Vested said in a blog post early this week. IndMoney had a similar partnership with SBM Bank, and as a result of the ban its users are not able to fund their accounts.  “Due to a temporary issue with the banking partner, you are unable to add money right now. Your money is absolutely safe in your regulated US stocks a/c. We will notify once you will be able to add money,” says IndMoney app’s cautionary note. IndMoney, which offers, multiple investment options, is one of the learning players in the global investment space. It claims to have catered to more than 5 million customers since its inception in 2019.   Operated by Finzoom Investment Advisors Pvt Ltd, the startup had last raised $86 million in its Series D round from Steadview Capital, Tiger Global Management, and Dragoneer Investment Group at a $650 million valuation.   On the other hand, customers of Niyo’s Global Card, which it had issued in partnership with SBM Bank, have complained of not being able to use the cards for international transactions.  Some of Niyo’s customers, who are travelling to foreign countries, had loaded their Niyo cards to save fees on foreign exchange transactions. However, to no avail, these customers are taking their frustration to Twitter, complaining how the sudden move has left them stranded in a foreign land.  “Our SBM Niyo Global program provides an international debit card with a savings account in partnership with SBM Bank India, an RBI-regulated bank. Currently, international transactions on this debit card are paused in order to comply with the recent RBI order. However, users can continue using the card for their domestic spends and transfers through various transactions and payment modes – ATM withdrawal, UPI, IMPS, POS, e-commerce, etc.  Further, we are closely working with SBM Bank India and remain hopeful for an early resumption of international transactions through the debit card, ” Niyo said in a statement. The Bengaluru-based startup is backed by Accel, Lightrock, Horizons Ventures, Tencent, Prime Venture Partners, and Social Capital, among others. It had last raised $30 million from private equity firm Multiples Alternate Asset Management in July last year. Share article on",https://www.vccircle.com//rbis-ban-on-sbm-bank-s-forex-transactions-hurts-fintech-firms,Finance,"The regulator has said that the action is based on “certain material supervisory concerns observed in the bank.” “The bank is engaging with RBI to address certain supervisory concerns at the earliest,” SBM Bank said in a mail to its customers, adding that it remains open for business in all other areas.With the ban on SBM, the platform isn’t able to reduce the overall cost of depositing funds to the US brokerage accounts of its customers.","['RBI', 'SBM Bank', 'SBM']","['up to $250,000', '$86 million', '$650 million', '$30 million']"

BharatPe FY22 loss soars due to exceptional item,26 January,"Fintech unicorn BharatPe posted a net loss of Rs 5,610.7 crore in the last fiscal, rising nearly 3.4x from the Rs 1,619.2 crore loss it incurred in the financial year 2021, owing to a sharp rise in a one-time non-cash expense related to change in fair value of compulsory convertible preference shares (CCPS). Keeping aside the CCPS cost, the Tiger Global-backed company’s adjusted loss grew 2.2x to Rs 828.2 crore in FY22 from Rs 227.3 crore in the fiscal before. It reported a loss due to change in the fair value of CCPS of Rs 4,782.1 crore and Rs 1,341.9 crore in FY22 and FY21, respectively, as per its financial statement available with the Registrar of Company (RoC).   “The CCPS-related item is a one-off and shall not be there from next year as we have now reclassified the compulsorily convertible preference shares from liability to equity,” BharatPe had said early this month while sharing a clarification around the soaring losses. BharatPe’s revenue from operations, on the other hand, surged 3.8x to Rs 456.8 crore from Rs 119 crore in FY21. The company primarily makes income from commissions on loans and rental charges for point-of-sale (PoS) machines. Its income from commissions stood at Rs 151.8 crore while it made Rs 126.8 crore from PoS machines. BharatPe, which is run by Resilient Innovations Private Ltd., was set up in 2018. The company began by launching the first interoperable UPI codes. It currently serves more than 1 crore merchants across 400+ cities.The company is backed by a host of marquee investors such as Dragoneer Investment Group, Beenext, Steadfast Capital, Ribbit Capital, and Steadview Capital, among others. It became a unicorn in 2021 after it raised $370 million in its Series E round led by Tiger Global Management. To date, it has raised over $650 million in equity.On the operations side, the company saw a sharp rise in financial guarantee payments to lending partners and transaction processing fees, which led to its expenses (minus the CCPS cost) surging 3.2x to Rs 1,483 crore. Financial guarantee cost, which accounted for nearly 18% of total expenses, stood at Rs 266.6 crore in FY22. Whereas its transaction processing charges and employee benefits expenses jumped to Rs 227 crore and Rs 184.8 crore, respectively. BharatPe claims its monthly loan disbursal rate is at around Rs 1,200 crores across all its products. It also claims that it facilitated disbursals of around Rs 4,500 crores in FY22 and is on track to do Rs 15,000 crores across the merchant and consumer side this year. “We remain on track to be operationally positive in the next few months,” the company said. However, in the last few months, BharatPe has seen multiple high-level exits, including that of former chief executive Suhail Sameer. The company is also currently underway a court case against former cofounder and CEO Ashneer Grover, alleging financial misappropriation. Grover and his wife were ousted from the company in March last year.  Share article on",https://www.vccircle.com//bharatpefy22-loss-soars-due-to-exceptional-item,Finance,"Fintech unicorn BharatPe posted a net loss of Rs 5,610.7 crore in the last fiscal, rising nearly 3.4x from the Rs 1,619.2 crore loss it incurred in the financial year 2021, owing to a sharp rise in a one-time non-cash expense related to change in fair value of compulsory convertible preference shares (CCPS).To date, it has raised over $650 million in equity.On the operations side, the company saw a sharp rise in financial guarantee payments to lending partners and transaction processing fees, which led to its expenses (minus the CCPS cost) surging 3.2x to Rs 1,483 crore.","['Fintech', 'BharatPe', 'CCPS']","['$370 million', 'over $650 million']"

Awareness of health insurance post-Covid has acted as a strong catalyst. Given that the distribution of retail health is primarily individual agent driven, SAHIs’ single product focus and distribution arbitrage over multi-line insurers provide them with a competitive advantage,” said Snigdha Khemka, director - consumer, financial institutions group (FIG) and business services, Avendus Capital. For investors, retail health insurance will continue to be one of the most exciting segments within the overall non-life insurance or general insurance space. Anshul Agarwal, managing director and co-head, consumer, FIG and business services at Avendus Capital, is of the view that the segment will continue to see significant investments due to high persistency rate, relatively low loss ratio and headroom for growth due to low penetration.“The ability to generate consistently high profits and RoE of over 20% would account for sustained investor appetite due to limited opportunities in companies which focus purely on the retail health segment,” said Agarwal. The report also pointed out that since approximately 45% of India’s relevant population is currently devoid of any health coverage, the retail health insurance segment is expected to be the leader among other non-life segments. According to the report, low penetration (with only 60 million individuals covered), coupled with a Covid-led rise in awareness, product innovation, rising disposable income etc. are some of the key catalysts for growth in the retail health segment, where coverage is expected to reach about 250 million individuals.Share article on",https://www.vccircle.com//retailhealth-insurance-market-can-give-20-roe-yearly,Finance,"India's retail health insurance sector has the potential to give a 20% yearly return on equity (RoE), according to a report by Avendus Capital, even as the sector has seen a surge in demand fuelled by a rise in policy purchases by families and individuals post covid.The retail health insurance segment covers only health insurance policies that are bought by individuals or families.The report, ""Retail Health Insurance: A Large Whitespace,"" has also forecast a market size of $25 billion for this space by FY27, a 5.3x jump from the $4 billion recorded in FY22.""In India, the health retail health insurance segment is currently dominated by five standard health insurers (SAHIs): Religare-led Care Health Insurance, Niva (Max) Bupa Health Insurance, Aditya Birla Health Insurance, Star Health and Allied Insurance and ManipalCigna Health Insurance,"" the report by the investment banking firm further noted.These entities have disrupted the market to capture over 50% share and are expected to be the biggest beneficiaries of growth within the segment, the study said, adding that these companies have received significant interest from global and domestic investors alike in the past.For instance, last year, Aditya Birla Health Insurance bagged Rs 665 crore from Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (ADIA) while Religare Enterprises Ltd was in the process of raising Rs 300 for Care Health Insurance via a rights issue.","['Care Health Insurance', 'Aditya Birla Health Insurance, Star Health', 'Allied Insurance', 'ManipalCigna Health Insurance', 'Aditya Birla Health Insurance', 'Abu Dhabi Investment Authority', 'ADIA', 'Religare Enterprises Ltd', 'Care Health Insurance']","['$25 billion', '$4 billion']"
BrightChamps announces $1 mn ESOPs for 400 teachers,24 January,"Upskilling startup BrightChamps Tech Pvt. Ltd has awarded $1 million worth of stock options to 400 of its ‘high performing’ teachers, the company announced on Tuesday.The teachers across 25 markets will receive these stock options, with the majority of them coming from key geographies such as India, Indonesia, Vietnam, Singapore, Malaysia, South Africa, Egypt, Lebanon, and UAE.The company said it is planning to award an increasing number of stock options every year for the next five years. BrightChamps currently consists of 2,500 teachers from 25 countries.BrightChamps’ chief financial officer, Amit Kumar said, “Creating avenues for greater financial value for our teachers is a part of our long-term financial strategy. We were able to evaluate and reward teaching faculty across all four business verticals in this round and look forward to increasing coverage in the coming months.”BrightChamps, founded in 2020 by Indian Institute of Technology Varanasi graduate Ravi Bhushan, is an edtech company that aims to bridge the gap between school education and children’s real learning needs. It aims to empower students to be technologically, financially, and socially smart by nurturing the potential of every child. In November 2021, BrightChamps raised $63 million at a valuation of $650 million from Premji Invest, GSV Ventures, Flipkart’s co-founder Binny Bansal, Beenext, and 021 Capital.In February, BrightChamps announced the acquisition of Education10x, a financial literacy education platform for children, in a cash and stock deal. Education10x was founded by Indian Institute of Management Calcutta alumni Gyan Tiwari, Prasanna N. Muley, and Bhavishya Chaurasia. The company has developed the world’s first gamified finance program for children in the 8 to 16 years age group.BrightChamps bought Singapore-based live-learning platform Schola for $15 million in a cash-and-stock deal. In June 2021, the edtech startup previously announced a $100mn investment war chest for mergers and acquisitions.In the recent past, layoffs at edtech companies have become a common sight as they struggle to raise cash amid tough market conditions. The re-shift of education from online to offline has presented immense challenges for such startups, especially those operating in the business-to-customer (B2C) space.Edtech startups will continue to face retrenchments in 2023. For instance, edtech unicorn Lead School sacked nearly 60 employees early this month after firing 100 employees in August, while upGrad-owned Harappa Education sacked 70 employees or 35% of its 200-strong workforce. More layoffs are likely at the company, the human resources department had told parting employees.Unacademy-owned Relevel, too, fired 40 employees, or roughly 20% of its workforce so far in 2023, as it pivots to a test product app called NextLevel. Massive layoffs across sectors come after a blockbuster 2021 when startups collectively raised more than $35 billion in venture capital funding. 2022 saw VC funding drop 30% to around $24 billion, according to data by Venture Intelligence.UpGrad-owned edtech platform Harappa Education has shown the door to around 70 employees or 35% of its 200-strong workforce.Share article on",https://www.vccircle.com//brightchampsannounces-1-mn-esops-for-400-teachers,Finance,"Ltd has awarded $1 million worth of stock options to 400 of its ‘high performing’ teachers, the company announced on Tuesday.The teachers across 25 markets will receive these stock options, with the majority of them coming from key geographies such as India, Indonesia, Vietnam, Singapore, Malaysia, South Africa, Egypt, Lebanon, and UAE.The company said it is planning to award an increasing number of stock options every year for the next five years.We were able to evaluate and reward teaching faculty across all four business verticals in this round and look forward to increasing coverage in the coming months.”BrightChamps, founded in 2020 by Indian Institute of Technology Varanasi graduate Ravi Bhushan, is an edtech company that aims to bridge the gap between school education and children’s real learning needs.",['Indian Institute of Technology Varanasi'],"['$1 million', '$63 million', '$650 million', '$15 million', '100mn', 'more than $35 billion', 'around $24 billion']"

Blackstone in talks with Bain to sell $480 mn stake in top Indian REIT,24 January,"Blackstone is in talks to sell around half of its stake in India's largest real estate investment trust Embassy Office Parks to private equity firm Bain Capital, two sources said, in a deal worth up to $480 million at current prices.  A deal would mark US-based Bain's first REIT investment in India where office space is drawing in investors as many workers have returned to offices with the waning of the COVID-19 pandemic. For Blackstone, it would mean a further selldown of its Embassy stake as it adjusts its portfolio. The talks are still at a preliminary stage, the sources told Reuters. The plan is to execute the transaction via block deals on Indian stock exchanges in the coming weeks, though a timeline or pricing has not been finalized, said the first source who had direct knowledge of the matter. A spokesperson for Blackstone declined to comment while Bain Capital and Embassy did not respond to requests for comment. The sources did not wish to be named as the discussions are private. Embassy Office Parks was India's first REIT to list in 2019. It owns and operates more than 43.2 million square feet of office parks and office buildings in cities such as Bengaluru and Mumbai and is also the largest office REIT in Asia by area. REITs own and operate real estate assets, similar to how mutual funds hold stocks. They earn rent from the properties they manage, which they use to distribute dividends to investors. Blackstone currently owns 24% of the Embassy REIT, which has a market capitalisation of nearly $4 billion. The private equity group is planning to sell about 10%-12% of it, the sources said. That will be worth $400 million-$480 million based on Monday's closing price of the Embassy REIT on the stock exchange in Mumbai. A block trade will be Blackstone's fourth stake sale in Embassy, following sales in 2020, 2021 and 2022. In September, Blackstone sold $400 million in the REIT to investors including the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority.  Even as inflation concerns weigh, India's economy has rebounded since the COVID pandemic to become one of the fastest growing major economies in the world. Knight Frank said this month that Bengaluru and Mumbai recorded the highest office rental growth in the Asia-Pacific market during October-December, adding that Indian cities' office rentals are expected to rise over the next year. Bain Capital, which manages more than $160 billion in assets globally, has already invested more than $3 billion in India in the past decade, including in leading Indian private lender Axis Bank.  For Blackstone, it's about cashing in. If a deal is completed with Bain, Blackstone would have sold units worth $1.4 billion in the Embassy REIT over the last three years, said the first source. ""Blackstone's strategy to pare its Embassy stake is to churn its capital. Office assets in India have matured and Blackstone is looking at investing in emerging asset classes like retail and data centres where the returns can be higher,"" said Shobhit Agarwal, chief executive of Anarock Capital. ""It is placing a bet on the domestic consumption story."" While Blackstone is selling its stake in some REITs, it is also investing in new assets, indicating it continues to remain bullish about the India real estate landscape, Agarwal added. The US group has invested more than $11 billion in Indian companies and assets over the years.Share article on",https://www.vccircle.com//blackstonein-talks-with-bain-to-sell-480-mn-stake-in-top-indian-reit,Finance,"Blackstone is in talks to sell around half of its stake in India's largest real estate investment trust Embassy Office Parks to private equity firm Bain Capital, two sources said, in a deal worth up to $480 million at current prices.The plan is to execute the transaction via block deals on Indian stock exchanges in the coming weeks, though a timeline or pricing has not been finalized, said the first source who had direct knowledge of the matter.","['Blackstone', 'Embassy Office Parks', 'Bain Capital']","['up to $480 million', 'more than 43.2 million square feet', 'nearly $4 billion', '$400 million-$480 million', '$400 million', 'more than $160 billion', 'more than $3 billion', '$1.4 billion', 'more than $11 billion']"

Japan's Credit Saison infuses Rs 540 cr into Indian arm,23 January,"Credit Saison India (CS India) has raised Rs 540 crore (around $67 million) in two tranches from Japan-based parent Credit Saison Company, bringing the total equity infusion in the company to from parent and its affiliates Rs 1,600 crore.This is the second infusion in CS India by its parent after it raised $47 million from Credit Saison in August 2021.   In 2019, CS India obtained an NBFC licence in India and subsequently established its wholesale lending and co-lending/fintech partnership divisions. The firm collaborates with other NBFCs, fintech firms and other modern lending companies to develop its retail portfolio, with a focus on the consumer and SME sectors. The company has expanded into lending directly through 20 branches and digitally via its consumer loan mobile application named ‘Privo’. CS India has an AUM (assets under management) of Rs 5,000 crore.  “As a neo-lending company, CS India prides is a technology-focused NBFC that offers solutions to meet various credit needs of consumers, SMEs, fintech companies and NBFCs. We are poised to grow to a $1 billion in AUM within the next 12 months. We were profitable within the first few months of starting lending and continue to regard profitability as one of our most important metrics,” said Presha Paragash, chief executive officer and director, CS India.  Commenting on the development, Saison International's global business head and CEO Kosuke Mori said, ""Currently Credit Saison's global business makes close to 10% of the overall group’s (Credit Saison Co) profits.

Log9 raises $40 mn in Series B,23 January,"Vehicle battery startup Log9 has raised $40 million in its Series B funding round in a mix of equity and debt, led by Amara Raja Batteries Ltd and Petronas Ventures. Other new investors, Incred Financial Services Private Ltd., Unity Small Finance Bank, Oxyzo Financial Services Private Ltd. and Western Capital Advisors Private Ltd. also participated in the round.   A company spokesperson declined to comment on the break-up of equity and debt in the $40 million funding.The deeptech startup plans to use the funds to increase its manufacturing capabilities. “The recent round of investments will allow us to grow our battery manufacturing capabilities to a 2 gigawatt hour (GWh) capacity by the end of 2024 and commission an integrated lithium Ion cell production line,” said Akshay Singhal, founder and chief executive officer of Log9. Founded in 2015 by Singhal, Kartik Hajela and Pankaj Sharma, Log9 is planning to invest Rs 100 crore towards advancements in cell and battery technology stacks. In the past few years, India’s electric vehicle ecosystem has picked up the pace, with the Indian government pushing for a cleaner mobility option. The central government expects the EV sales penetration to grow to 30% for private vehicles, 70% for commercial vehicles and 80% for two/three-wheelers by 2030.Public and private investments in the segment will play an important role in meeting this target.

PhonePe raises $350 mn at $12 billion valuation,19 January,"Walmart-owned Indian digital payments app PhonePe has raised $350 million from US private equity firm General Atlantic at a pre-money valuation of $12 billion, becoming the latest decacorn as well as the most valuable homegrown fintech startup. A decacorn is a privately held company valued at $10 billion or more.The investment is the first tranche of PhonePe’s latest fundraising that could see marquee global and Indian investors pour in up to $1 billion in PhonePe. Existing investors, including Tiger Global Management, Qatar Investment Authority and Microsoft, are also likely to invest in PhonePe.The company plans to deploy the funds to strengthen infrastructure, including the development of data centres, and to build financial services offerings at scale in the country.“We look forward to delivering the next phase of our growth by investing in new business verticals like insurance, wealth management and lending while also facilitating the next wave of growth for UPI payments in India,” said Sameer Nigam, co-founder and chief executive at PhonePe.The IPO-bound firm also plans to invest in new businesses, including insurance, wealth management, and lending.

As part of the transaction, existing shareholders of Flipkart Singapore and PhonePe Singapore, led by Walmart, bought shares directly in PhonePe India.

Zero To One gets Sebi nod to launch early-stage fund,18 January,"Angel network Zero To One Fund has received approval from markets regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) to launch its Rs 300 crore category-1 alternative investment fund (AIF).  The New Delhi-based network - including 500 angels under its umbrella from India, Singapore, Dubai, US and UK - will invest in early-stage startups by participating in pre-seed to Series A funding rounds, with focus on edtech, healthtech, agritech, medtech and cleantech spaces.Zero To One was launched by chartered accountant turned investment banker Praveen Kaushik and Rahul Massey in 2022. ""The idea behind founding Zero To One is not only to fund startups but create an ecosystem that can assist and support startups,"" said Kaushik, who is also the director of the angel network. In the past few months, early-stage funding has witnessed an uptick globally, despite a slowdown in the overall dealmaking pace. According to data from Venture Intelligence, the average ticket size for an early-stage deal in 2022 stood at $4 million, against $3.4 million in 2021. These pre-seed to Series A investments are likely to grow in the coming months as several venture capital firms and angel networks have recently launched funds to back early-stage startups. For instance, last month, Mumbai-based early-stage startup investment platform We Founder Circle launched two funds to back early-stage startups in India. The first fund, Invstt Trust, will be an angel fund, and has a target corpus of Rs 200 crore, with a green shoe option of up to Rs 200 crore. On the other hand, the second fund, We Founder Circle Global Angels Fund, will be a cross-border fund in Gift City, Gandhinagar, with a target corpus of $30 million and a green shoe option of $30 million.   Meanwhile, in October 2022, early-stage investing platform Indian Angel Network (IAN)  launched its second fund, IAN Alpha Fund, with a fund corpus of Rs 1000 (about $120 million) crore, 2x size of its first fund of Rs 375 crore. In the same month, sector-agnostic fund SphitiCap launched its maiden venture fund with an aim to raise a corpus of around $500 million, targeting enterprises focused on sustainability, growth and impact. Share article on",https://www.vccircle.com//zeroto-one-gets-sebi-nod-to-launch-early-stage-fund,Finance,"The New Delhi-based network - including 500 angels under its umbrella from India, Singapore, Dubai, US and UK - will invest in early-stage startups by participating in pre-seed to Series A funding rounds, with focus on edtech, healthtech, agritech, medtech and cleantech spaces.Zero To One was launched by chartered accountant turned investment banker Praveen Kaushik and Rahul Massey in 2022.On the other hand, the second fund, We Founder Circle Global Angels Fund, will be a cross-border fund in Gift City, Gandhinagar, with a target corpus of $30 million and a green shoe option of $30 million.",[],"['$4 million', '$3.4 million', '$30 million', '$30 million', 'about $120 million', 'around $500 million']"

Sachdeva, managing director, Sundaram Alternates. “We are confident in our ability to continue driving compelling returns for our investors through the combination of our team’s deep market expertise and disciplined approach to investing,” he said. The investments made through ECCO I will be backed by the investee firms’ tangible assets and “comfort from the promoters of the investee to enhance capital protection”. The AIF’s returns are targeted between 16% and 18% with periodic current yield to investors, as per the product note. The credit fund will also focus on climate, environmental, social and governance (CESG) intervention as part of its investment evaluation framework to build its portfolio.

"Blue Tokai rakes in $30 mn from A91 Partners, White Whale Ventures, others",18 January,"Homegrown coffee brand Blue Tokai Coffee Roasters on Wednesday said it has secured Series B funding of $30 million (around Rs 246 crore) led by A91 Partners. The round also saw participation from White Whale Ventures, with existing investors Grand Anicut Fund and 8i Ventures. The company did not disclose its valuation after the fundraise. In November last year, VCCircle had first reported that Blue Tokai is in talks with several private investors to raise $12- $15 million in a fresh round of equity funding. The startup will deploy the fresh funds to scale up business and expand its presence in the speciality coffee markets globally. It is also working towards rolling out a slate of new FMCG products.  “We are focussed on growing our presence across all of our channels, including our own cafes as well as our B2C (business-to-consumer) and B2B (business-to-business) offerings. In the coming three years, we plan to showcase the work done by 100 new speciality coffee producers, thus enabling a far more diverse product offering at Blue Tokai,” said Matt Chitharanjan, co-founder and chief executive at Blue Tokai.  Over the next three years, the company is planning to add 200 new stores, taking its overall count to well over 250 cafes. “We will also be investing in our B2B arm, bringing new technology for our partners through our machine offerings,” said Shivam Shahi, cofounder and chief operating officer at Blue Tokai.  Founded in 2013, Blue Tokai sells speciality coffee as well as runs standalone cafes and roasteries. At present, the brand operates four roasteries and over 60 physical outlets across major Indian cities. It also has international operations in Japan. The brand, known for its easy-to-brew and ready-to-drink offerings, has of late launched cold brew cans, easy-pour sachets, and biodegradable coffee capsules. “The $30 million raise is a testament to the strength of Blue Tokai brand and the quality of its products. We believe that Blue Tokai has enormous potential and look forward to supporting its journey as they continue to innovate and expand on its path to an IPO,” said Vikram Chachra, founding partner, 8i Ventures.  Blue Tokai’s Series B round follows the company’s previous investment round of Rs 17 crore from Anicut Angel Fund in August last year. Prior to that, it had raised close to Rs 40 crore from early-stage funds and angel investors in 2020.  In the financial year that ended in March 2022, Blue Tokai’s loss soared to Rs 12.2 crore from Rs 7.1 crore in the fiscal before, despite its operating revenue rising to Rs 73.8 crore from Rs 40.9 crore in FY21, as per data sourced from VCCEdge.   In the recent past, several direct-to-consumer (D2C) firms have entered the Indian coffee market, despite the dominance of large players such as Nescafe, Starbucks and Cafe Coffee Day.

BharatPe co-founder Koladiya moves court against Ashneer Grover to reclaim stake,18 January,"BharatPe’s original founder Bhavik Koladiya has approached the Delhi high court to reclaim his shares from ousted managing director Ashneer Grover, who is also a co-founder of the fintech startup.The matter has been listed before Justice Prateek Jalan in the Delhi high court.BharatPe was incorporated in March 2018 by Koladiya and Shashvat Nakrani (who was then studying at IIT-Delhi) as co-founders, with each owning a 50% stake. Koladiya was the company’s face back then and was talking to investors for funding.Three months later, in June 2018, Grover joined as the third co-founder.When Grover joined BharatPe, he received 32% equity, Nakrani held 25.5%, and Koladiya retained the largest stake at 42.5%, according to Registrar of Companies filings.Last year, Mint was the first to report about Koladiya and Grover’s fight over shares.However, six months later, in December 2018, just before Sequoia came on board as an investor, Koladiya’s name went missing from the founders’ list, “owning to discomfort on the part of large institutional investors to have a person with a jail term in the US.""Koladiya, who went to the US in 2007, operated an unlicensed digital payment system at his grocery store, violating US identity theft and mail fraud laws.Koladiya was arrested but let go with a fine of $100 and deported back to India in 2015.And since Sequoia came on board, Grover became the face of the company, while Koladiya continued as a ‘consultant’.However, the founders reached an understanding to minimize Koladiya’s public involvement.The arrangement involved him transferring his stake to Grover, Nakrani, Nakrani’s father (also his erstwhile schoolteacher) and some angel investors.Koladiya declined to comment, referring the questions to his attorneys, Sim & San.

Oyo to refile draft papers for IPO with Sebi by Feb,18 January,"Hospitality unicorn Oyo on Wednesday said it would refile its draft initial public offering (IPO) documents by mid-February after the markets regulator returned them on 30 December. Oravel Stays Ltd, which runs Oyo, was asked to refile the draft red herring prospectus with updates and revisions, delaying its target of an early 2023 offering. “We are working on updating all key sections simultaneously. We are keen on refiling the DRHP by the middle of February,” an Oyo spokesperson said, without commenting on when it expects to get Sebi’s approval. Oyo initially filed its draft papers with the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) in September 2021 for an issue of ₹8,430 crore, comprising a primary capital raise of around ₹7,000 crore and a secondary share sale of ₹1,430 crore. In May 2022, it wrote to the Sebi to revise its financials, delaying its IPO beyond September amid weak market conditions, VCCircle reported. At the time of filing its DRHP, the company was looking at a valuation of about $10 billion, which it then lowered to $7-8 billion. In September, a year after filing its DRHP, the company revived its IPO plans, filing an addendum to its original DRHP after cost cuts and a recovery in travel brought down losses. It filed a second addendum in November, updating Sebi and potential investors with financial performance in the first half of FY23. Following this, the regulator asked the company to update all relevant sections, such as risk factors, KPIs, outstanding litigations and basis for the offer, and file the DRHP afresh. “The disclosures contained in present DRHP do not take into account the material changes/disclosures arising from updated financial statements as filed through addendums,” Sebi said. Meanwhile, the valuation of Oyo in the private market dipped to around $6.5 billion after SoftBank reportedly slashed the firm’s valuation in its books by more than 20%. The company is now trying to accelerate the IPO process. It had previously indicated that the refiling could take up to 2-3 months. Oyo reported a profit of ₹63 crore for the first half of FY23 against a loss of ₹280 crore a year ago. Its revenues in the six months to 30 September grew 24% to ₹2,905 crore from a year earlier. Ahead of the IPO, the company shut down a few projects in December and merged its product and engineering teams. As part of the restructuring, it said it planned to lay off 600 executives across its technology and product teams. The Gurugram-based company was founded in 2012 by Ritesh Agarwal. It now focuses on four main regions: India, Malaysia, Indonesia and Europe, where it manages vacation homes and has cut down operations in markets it previously considered crucial, such as the US and China. Share article on",https://www.vccircle.com//oyoto-re-file-drhp-with-sebi-in-feb,Finance,"Oyo initially filed its draft papers with the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) in September 2021 for an issue of ₹8,430 crore, comprising a primary capital raise of around ₹7,000 crore and a secondary share sale of ₹1,430 crore.Following this, the regulator asked the company to update all relevant sections, such as risk factors, KPIs, outstanding litigations and basis for the offer, and file the DRHP afresh.",['the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi'],"['8,430', '7,000', '1,430', 'about $10 billion', 'around $6.5 billion', '280', '2,905']"

Fintech startup NeoGrowth raises $10 mn from MicroVest,17 January,"NeoGrowth, a non-banking finance company with a focus on micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs), on Tuesday said it has secured debt funding of $10 million (around Rs 81 crore) from US-based global investment firm MicroVest Capital Management. The investment comes one month after NeoGrowth had raised Rs 300 crore (around $36.2 million) in a Series D equity round led by Dutch development bank FMO and existing investors.  The company plans to deploy the fresh proceeds to expand its India’s geographical footprint while aiming to secure more growth capital. “NeoGrowth is dedicated to funding India's small businesses by using the digital payments ecosystem. The funding will be used to help the growth of MSMEs and integrate them into the mainstream financing ecosystem,” said Arun Nayyar, managing director and chief executive at NeoGrowth.   Mumbai-based NeoGrowth was co-founded by Dhruv Khaitan and Piyush Khaitan. It claims to have connected with over 1,50,000 micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) since its inception and disbursed around $1 billion in loans.   The decade-old startup offers loans to small businesses, based on underwriting of their digital transactions and cash flow to assess the health of the business. Its lending activities also focus on the financial inclusion of first-time entrepreneurs, women business owners, and underserved small businesses. It offers loans to MSMEs across multiple segments and has a presence at around 25 locations in India.   NeoGrowth is also backed by investors, namely FMO, Omidyar Network, Lightrock, Khosla Impact, Accion Frontier Inclusion Fund – Quona Capital, IIFL Seed Ventures Fund, WestBridge and Leapfrog Investments.  MicroVest is an asset manager that specializes in allocating private debt capital to responsible financial institutions that lend to unbanked or underbanked borrowers or small businesses in emerging and frontier markets.   In November 2022, NeoGrowth secured $20 million (around Rs 160 crore) from the United States International Development Finance Corporation (DFC) via the external commercial borrowing (ECB) route.Share article on",https://www.vccircle.com//fintechstartup-neogrowth-raises-10-mn-from-microvest,Finance,"The funding will be used to help the growth of MSMEs and integrate them into the mainstream financing ecosystem,” said Arun Nayyar, managing director and chief executive at NeoGrowth.The decade-old startup offers loans to small businesses, based on underwriting of their digital transactions and cash flow to assess the health of the business.",['NeoGrowth'],"['$10 million', 'around $36.2 million', 'around $1 billion', '$20 million']"
Paytm can hit EBITDA profitability by March 2023: Goldman Sachs,17 January,"Fintech major Paytm may hit adjusted Ebitda (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) profitability by March 2023, six months ahead of company’s guidance of September 2023, Goldman Sachs has said in its research report. The banking and research firm expects the Paytm to report a strong third quarter, which will put it on track to achieve Ebitda profitability (before accounting for employee stock ownership plans costs) by the fourth quarter. Goldman reiterated its ‘Buy’ call for the stock and raised 12-month target price to Rs 1,120 per share from Rs 1,100 previously. Paytm, which is one of India’s biggest fintech players, provides loans to its customers and merchant partners in partnerships with non-banking finance companies. It earns a commission based on the loans it issues to Paytm postpaid users and merchants. “Paytm’s MTU (monthly transacting users), loan disbursals and devices deployed continue to surprise us positively, and we have further raised our estimates for these metrics,” Goldman’s analysts said in the report.The upgrade comes on the back of stronger lending volumes and payment margins, coupled with UPI reimbursement from the government. The improving margins would “further increase the street’s confidence around the company’s ability to be profitable in the calendar year 2023,” the analysts said. Goldman expects Paytm to achieve an adjusted EBITDA of $150 million by financial year 2025, one of the highest compared to other listed Indian internet companies, ahead of Zomato and Nykaa. The stock of One 97 Communications, since its initial public offering in November 2021, has plunged by more than 65% on the National Stock Exchange to Rs 537.6 amidst tough macro environment. The company, like other tech startups that went public in the last two years, has been under pressure from investors to achieve profitability. In the analysis, Goldman said it sees more gains than risk of a loss for Paytm, whose valuation multiples are at a discount to its domestic and global peers, considering its improved outlook for growth. Paytm, in an update earlier this month, said it has witnessed a 32% jump in average monthly transacting users to 85 million in December quarter of FY2023. For the third quarter, the loan distribution business saw a growth of over 4.5X with the fintech disbursing loans over 10.5 million worth Rs 9,958 crore, it said. In the second quarter of FY23, Paytm widened its losses to Rs 571 crore, compared to a net loss of Rs 472.90 crore in the same period last year. Its revenue from operations for the second quarter of FY23 jumped 76% to Rs 1,914 crore on a year-on-year basis.  Share article on",https://www.vccircle.com//paytmcan-hit-ebitda-profitability-by-march-2023-goldman-sachs,Finance,"“Paytm’s MTU (monthly transacting users), loan disbursals and devices deployed continue to surprise us positively, and we have further raised our estimates for these metrics,” Goldman’s analysts said in the report.The upgrade comes on the back of stronger lending volumes and payment margins, coupled with UPI reimbursement from the government.In the second quarter of FY23, Paytm widened its losses to Rs 571 crore, compared to a net loss of Rs 472.90 crore in the same period last year.","['Goldman', 'UPI']","['$150 million', 'One 97 Communications']"

Lighthouse Canton marks 1st close of debt fund at ₹155 cr,16 January,"Singapore-based Lighthouse Canton (LC) has marked the first close of its maiden India-focused venture debt fund at ₹ 155.4 crore (about $19 million). The firm launched the LC Venture Debt, a category-II alternate investment fund (AIF), worth ₹550 crore in August 2022, with a green shoe option of ₹550 crore. The fund would provide debt financing to tech startups in India. A growing number of Indian startups are looking to raise debt amid a broader funding slowdown. Consequently, more venture capital (VC) firms are raising funds to invest as venture debt. Last October, Edelweiss Wealth Management launched a ₹3,000 crore venture debt fund. Chennai-based Anicut Capital is looking to mark the first close of a ₹1,500 crore fund, its third debt fund, by April. Alteria Capital marked the first close of its third fund at ₹ 1,000 crore in October. “Lighthouse Canton aims to invest in Series B and C rounds of startups through this fund, with an average ticket size of ₹10-20 crore,” Ankit Agrawal, director, venture debt, at LC said. “We’ve been seeing quite a lot of demand for debt capital in this region,” added Sanket Sinha, global head of asset management, LC. “Considering the macroeconomic environment, where founders are looking for non-dilutive sources of funding and given how under-penetrated venture debt in India generally is compared to more mature markets (in US and Europe), we felt this is the right time,” Sinha said. LC’s move to launch the venture debt fund follows the closure in August of its debut VC fund at $40 million set up in partnership with Nueva Capital. It has applied with the regulator for a ₹50 crore extension of the fund, which was oversubscribed. “As the pace of venture capital activity continues to grow, it is logical that we would see a rise in venture debt demand,” said Sinha. “Given the growth of the venture ecosystem in India, we see significant opportunity for venture debt and expect the size of this market to grow 3-4x in the next five years,” he said.   In comparison to the debt fund, LC’s VC fund is focused on investing in pre-Series A and Series A startups in India. So far, the firm via its debt fund has invested in three companies, with two more in the pipeline, the firm said. It intends to deploy the capital across 35-40 firms in the next two years across sectors. “We like companies, which are closer to being profitable, and if not, then have a clear visibility on whether profitability would be achieved,” said Sinha, adding that the fund would consider factors such as revenue, profitability, capitalization, working capital among others before investing. LC also has a venture debt fund in Singapore, where it aims to invest about Rs 200-250 crore. “Given that our venture debt strategy is regional, we can also support a startup with aspirations to expand out of the domestic market,” said Agrawal. “Our presence in other markets uniquely positions us to partner with companies with international expansion plans and help them with their financing needs,” he said. LC has offices in Singapore, Dubai, and India, and oversees over $ 3 billion worth of assets under management and advisory. Its VC firm has made more than 25 investments across companies such as Redcliffe Labs, Saveo, RevFin, and Financepeer in its portfolio. Share article on",https://www.vccircle.com//lighthousecanton-s-india-se-asia-focused-debt-fund-marks-first-close,Finance,"“Given the growth of the venture ecosystem in India, we see significant opportunity for venture debt and expect the size of this market to grow 3-4x in the next five years,” he said.In comparison to the debt fund, LC’s VC fund is focused on investing in pre-Series A and Series A startups in India.",[],"['about $19 million', '550', '550', '3,000', '1,500', '$40 million', '50', 'over $ 3 billion']"
"Sequioa backed Klub extends credit to BluSmart, Hero Electric, others",16 January,"Revenue-based financing platform Klub on Monday said it has extended credit up to Rs 50 crore (around $6 million) to six companies.These companies include vegan skincare brand Neemli Naturals, electric ride-sharing firm BluSmart Mobility, plastic-free toy store Ariro Wooden Toys, home decor brand Ecofynd, solar energy firm Freyr Energy and electric scooter company Hero Electric.   Revenue-based financing (RBF) is a model that involves getting returns based on the recurring revenue of the firm invested in. Startups that secure capital through this way pledge a percentage of their current gross revenue over periodic intervals as repayment.   The eco-friendly product market has grown geometrically over the last 7 years or so globally, and India is no exception, the company said in a statement elaborating on their investment. a research study by marketing company TerraChoice revealed a 73% growth in the eco-friendly product market over the last 5-7 years and more new companies and products are making entries.     “India is very different from the one that we knew ten years ago. Sustainable industry a decade ago was hardly spoken about, whereas today, at least 60% of Indians are ready to pay a premium price for a sustainable product,” said Anurakt Jain, Co-founder and chief executive at Klub.    “We want to support this new pendulum of change by helping sustainable brands grow in the Indian startup ecosystem, even more in 2023 and future years to come. We are aiming to have at least 40% of our portfolio with such brands,” he added. Founded by Jain and Ishita Verma, Klub provides flexible growth capital ranging from Rs 2 lakh to Rs 30 crore with zero equity dilution or personal guarantees. The company has funded more than 380 brands across sectors in India.   Last year, online furniture rental startup Furlenco, which is run by Bengaluru-based House of Kieraya (HoK), raised debt from Klub, against future recurring revenue.  Klub has secured funds for direct-to-consumer brands like SMOOR, The Label Life, Petsutra and Tjori, TagZ Foods, among others.   Since its launch in December 2021, Klub’s Aceler8 fund has disbursed capital to late-stage online companies for expansion and inventory purposes.

Investment in crypto companies drops by 42% in 2022,11 January,"Investments in cryptocurrency companies fell 42.5% to $21.26 billion year-on-year, amid bearish market conditions, a report by CoinGecko has said. However, the cumulative fund raised was still higher than the total funding raised each year from 2018 to 2020. 2021 saw a massive jump in terms of the funds pumped in the cryptocurrency industry. The industry saw a record $37 million invested over the course of the year, which is the highest cumulative amount ever invested till date.  The report noted that despite low numbers in comparison to 2021, companies fared better than all the other years i.e 2018-2020, which points to the cryptocurrency industry’s growth over the last five years which has led to more financial backing and increasing interest from institutional investors. In terms of a quarter-wise funding breakdown, the investments in crypto companies reduced in each successive quarter of 2022. In 2022, funding for cryptocurrency companies shrank from $8.72 billion, which was raised in the first quarter to progressively lesser investments, with $5.92 billion in the second quarter, $3.61 billion in the third quarter and finally, $2.99 billion in the fourth quarter.  It is imperative to compare the quarter-wise numbers of 2021 as well. In the first quarter of 2021 crypto companies raised $5.58 billion with the explosive spike partly fuelled by greater institutional interest in 2020.  Subsequently, each quarter reaffirmed the growing interest in the crypto space, with companies raising $7.43 billion in the second quarter of 2021, followed by $8.99 billion in the third quarter, and the final quarter closed the year with a peak at $15.00 billion (+66.8% QoQ). Prior to 2021, the highest amount of funding in a single quarter was $8.19 billion in 2018 Q2. The cryptocurrency industry has been having a very tough year globally as well as in India with the crash of FTX, one of the world’s largest crypto exchanges headed by its erstwhile chief executive, Sam Bankman-Fried in November 2022, which prompted global crypto exchange Binance’s chief executive officer Changpen Zhao to set up an ‘industry recovery fund’ to support ‘strong’ crypto ventures that may be under a liquidity crunch. In India as well, cryptocurrency exchange WazirX which is operated by Zanmai Labs Pvt Ltd is currently under the ED scanner in a money laundering case, in pursuance of which the ED conducted searches on one of the directors of WazirX, and froze the exchange’s bank balances worth ₹64.67 crore in August 2022.  Share article on",https://www.vccircle.com//investmentin-crypto-companies-drops-by-42-in-2022,Finance,"In 2022, funding for cryptocurrency companies shrank from $8.72 billion, which was raised in the first quarter to progressively lesser investments, with $5.92 billion in the second quarter, $3.61 billion in the third quarter and finally, $2.99 billion in the fourth quarter.Subsequently, each quarter reaffirmed the growing interest in the crypto space, with companies raising $7.43 billion in the second quarter of 2021, followed by $8.99 billion in the third quarter, and the final quarter closed the year with a peak at $15.00 billion (+66.8% QoQ).",['QoQ'],"['$21.26 billion', 'a record $37 million', '$8.72 billion', '$5.92 billion', '$3.61 billion', '$2.99 billion', '$5.58 billion', '$7.43 billion', '$8.99 billion', '$15.00 billion', '$8.19 billion']"

"Online stockbroker Zerodha's profit surges past Rs 2,000 cr",09 January,"India’s largest stock broking platform Zerodha posted a profit surged past Rs 2,000 crore in FY22, at a time when most Indian startups are struggling to attain profitability. The bootstrapped firm reported a profit of Rs 2,094.4 crore, growing 87% over previous year, according to its filings with the Registrar of Companies (RoC) accessed by data intelligence platform Tofler. The Bengaluru-based unicorn provides share broking services, financial services and portfolio management consultancy services. It was founded by Nithin and Nikhil Kamath in 2010. The company reported an operating revenue of Rs 4,963.7 crore in FY22, up 82% over last year. All of this was through sale of services, for which it charges a small fee. However, chief executive Nithin Kamath had warned of the slowdown in the industry in an update last month.“We have already seen an almost 50% fall in monthly new account openings from January this year, and this trend has been similar across the industry,”  he said. Co-founder Nikhil Kamath also said in an earlier interaction with VCCircle that investors across the board must be “circumspect” with their trades in the current market.“While we are on track to do as much revenue and profits as last year, even this year, we think we will be unable to match the current revenues and profitability from the next financial year for a few more years,” Nithin added in the note.  In FY22, the company’s expenses also grew by 72% to Rs 2,164.1 crore in line with company’s expenses, as compared to Rs 1,260.2 crore in FY21.Its employee benefit expense grew 45% to Rs 459 crore.  A large part of this was other expenses that grew 82% to Rs 1,686.5 crore during the year, which included an Information Technology expense of Rs 303.1 crore and miscellaneous expenses of Rs 1,342.4 crore. The note further highlighted that the industry has “temporarily hit a plateau in terms of the target market, customers who have sufficient savings to invest in the market” “The business will also most likely get impacted due to the changing regulatory landscape, where, among many things, the working capital requirements are going up quickly, ” the note added. The stock broking platform led by the Kamath brothers claims to process orders for over 1 crore clients daily. As per its website, transactions on the stock broking platform account for about 15% of the total retail trading volumes in India. The platform’s products are divided into investments and technology offerings.It allows retail investors to trade in various asset classes including stocks, mutual funds, future & options, fixed income products that allow investment in government-backed securities or sovereign gold bonds, and initial public offerings (IPOs). Some of its key tech offerings offer trading platforms for various use-cases, apart from allowing trading with its partner platforms like Smallcase, Streak, Sensibull, GoldenPi, and Ditto.Among other trading platforms operating in India, Groww posted over 2.5x growth in its FY22 net profit at Rs 6.8 crore from its earlier Rs 2.6 crore net profit. The online trading platform’s revenue from operations widened about 8x to Rs 348 crore in FY22, against Rs 40.5 crore in FY21.Its overall expenses in the given fiscal were 775% higher year-on-year at Rs 359.4 crore, with a significant rise seen in its IT expense, which soared to Rs 145.5 crore in FY22 from Rs 16.87 crore in FY21.Share article on",https://www.vccircle.com//onlinestockbroker-zerodha-s-profit-surges-past-rs-2-000-cr,Finance,"Co-founder Nikhil Kamath also said in an earlier interaction with VCCircle that investors across the board must be “circumspect” with their trades in the current market.“While we are on track to do as much revenue and profits as last year, even this year, we think we will be unable to match the current revenues and profitability from the next financial year for a few more years,” Nithin added in the note.The online trading platform’s revenue from operations widened about 8x to Rs 348 crore in FY22, against Rs 40.5 crore in FY21.Its overall expenses in the given fiscal were 775% higher year-on-year at Rs 359.4 crore, with a significant rise seen in its IT expense, which soared to Rs 145.5 crore in FY22 from Rs 16.87 crore in FY21.Share article on",['VCCircle'],[]
Samara Capital sells stakes in three portfolio firms,09 January,"Samara Capital has sold its stakes in medical devices firm Sahajanand Medical Technologies Ltd, staffing firm First Meridian Business Services Pvt. Ltd and biryani restaurant Paradise Food Court Pvt. Ltd to a TR Capital-led investor consortium in a $150 million secondaries deal. Samara Capital’s stakes in the three firms will be transferred to a $150 million ‘Continuation Fund’ or Samara Capital 2B where investors TR Capital, Axiom Asia, Stepstone Group and Unigestion will pool in the capital, Samara and TR Capital said in a joint statement on Monday. Some existing investors from Samara Capital Fund 2 will also be part of Samara Capital 2B, the firm’s co-founder Sumeet Narang said in an interview. “A lot of investors got liquidity in a very volatile environment,” Narang said. Samara Capital raised $210 million for its second fund, according to VCCEdge. It first invested in Paradise Food Court in June 2014, invested in vascular devices maker Sahajanand Medical Technologies in 2016 and 2017, and in First Meridian in 2018. “For Samara Fund II’s limited partners, the transaction generates immediate proceeds despite 2022’s volatile macro environment, increasing DPI (Distributed Paid-In) towards 2.0x for the 2014 vintage fund,” the statement said. The DPI indicates the amount that funds have paid back to their investors.For Samara Capital, this is its second such transaction in two years. In August 2021, it rolled its stake in Saphire Foods (which operates KFC, and Pizza Hut restaurants) into a new entity, where investors Creador, NewQuest and TR Capital cumulatively put in ₹1,150 crore. With the latest fund, Samara Capital would have exited eight of its ten investments from its second fund, which is scheduled to end in July 2024. “Of the remaining two, one portfolio we will exit next month, and the remaining one we will exit by the end of the year,” Narang said, without naming the portfolio firms. Separately, First Meridian and Sahajanand will both continue with their listing plans, with First Meridian likely to list next month, Narang said. First Meridian received approval from the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) in November 2022 for an initial public offering. Sahajanand, which received Sebi’s nod in December 2021, will need to refile its IPO papers as such approvals have a validity of 12 months from the date of issuance of observations by the market regulator.“We see strong leadership and growth potential in the three companies we are investing in, and their capabilities are reflected in their respective operating and financial metrics. The portfolio we are buying also has an excellent mix of high-growth businesses with scale and clear exit paths, which sparked our interest early in the process,” Paul Robine, founder and chief executive officer of TR Capital, said. TR Capital, which specializes in secondaries investments, invests in India, China and Southeast Asia. “We have seen an acceleration in secondaries transactions over the past five years and an even greater acceleration in the past two years,” Robine added. TR Capital raised $350 million for its fourth secondaries fund in February 2021. Secondaries funds have the mandate to buy shares of other investors in companies and do not participate in primary fundraises of companies. Robine said the main reason for the growth in the secondaries market is that it has become acceptable and astute for funds to sell stakes in companies to secondaries funds. “In India, private equity investments have been increasing every year by 30% on average. Over the past six years, unrealized value in India held by funds in the private equity segment is growing close to $100 billion,” Robine added. UBS Investment Bank advised Samara on the latest transaction. According to Robine, technology, healthcare, and consumer companies are likely to drive secondaries transactions in India.In India, TR Capital is also an investor in Lenskart, BigBasket, Arohan Financial Services, and sportswear retailer SSIPL. Mint reported last week that investors, including TR Capital, are selling partial stakes in Lenskart. The firm manages capital commitments of over $1.2 billion across funds, according to its website.Share article on",https://www.vccircle.com//samaracapital-sells-stakes-in-three-portfolio-firms,Finance,"Samara Capital’s stakes in the three firms will be transferred to a $150 million ‘Continuation Fund’ or Samara Capital 2B where investors TR Capital, Axiom Asia, Stepstone Group and Unigestion will pool in the capital, Samara and TR Capital said in a joint statement on Monday.Sahajanand, which received Sebi’s nod in December 2021, will need to refile its IPO papers as such approvals have a validity of 12 months from the date of issuance of observations by the market regulator.“We see strong leadership and growth potential in the three companies we are investing in, and their capabilities are reflected in their respective operating and financial metrics.","['Samara Capital’s', 'TR Capital', 'Stepstone Group', 'TR Capital', 'IPO']","['$150 million', '$150 million', '$210 million', '1,150', '$350 million', 'close to $100 billion', 'over $1.2 billion']"
Goldman Sachs readies biggest layoff since 2008 financial crisis,09 January,"Goldman Sachs Group will start cutting thousands of jobs across the firm from Wednesday, two sources familiar with the move said, as it prepares for a tough economic environment.Just over 3,000 employees will be let go, one of the sources said, but the final number is yet to be determined. That scale of layoffs would be the largest since the 2008 financial crisis, one of the sources said.The sources could not be named as the information was not yet disclosed publicly. Goldman Sachs declined to comment.Bloomberg News reported on Sunday that Goldman would eliminate about 3,200 positions.Goldman had 49,100 employees at the end of the third quarter, after adding significant numbers of staff during the coronavirus pandemic.The layoffs are likely to affect most of the bank's major divisions, but should centre on Goldman Sachs' investment banking arm, one of the sources said. Wall Street banks have suffered a major slowdown in corporate dealmaking activity as a result of volatile global financial markets.Hundreds of jobs are also likely to be reduced from Goldman Sachs' consumer business, Marcus, after it scaled back plans for the loss-making unit, the sources said.The bank's chief executive David Solomon sent a year-end voice memo to staff warning of a headcount reduction in the first half of January, two separate sources said. Goldman Sachs declined comment on the memo.The job cuts come ahead of the bank's annual bonus payments which are usually delivered later in January and are expected to fall about 40%.The bank restarted its annual performance review process and staff cuts in September after pausing for two years during the pandemic.The Wall Street giant typically trims about 1% to 5% of employees each year. These new cuts will come on top of the earlier layoffs.Global banks, including Morgan Stanley and Citigroup Inc, have reduced their workforces in recent months as a dealmaking boom on Wall Street fizzled out due to high interest rates, tensions between the United States and China, the war between Russia and Ukraine, and soaring inflation.Global investment banking fees nearly halved in 2022, with $77 billion earned by the banks, down from $132.3 billion one year earlier, Dealogic data showed.The total value of mergers and acquisitions (M&A) globally had slumped 37% to $3.66 trillion by Dec. 20, according to Dealogic data, after hitting an all-time high of $5.9 trillion last year.Banks had executed $517 billion worth of equity capital markets (ECM) transactions by late December 2022, the lowest level since the early 2000s and a 66% drop from 2021's bonanza, according to Dealogic data.Despite the slowdown, Goldman's top dealmakers told Reuters in recent interviews that they are bullish on an M&A recovery in the second half of 2023.Share article on",https://www.vccircle.com//goldmansachs-readies-biggest-layoff-since-2008-financial-crisis,Finance,"Goldman Sachs declined to comment.Bloomberg News reported on Sunday that Goldman would eliminate about 3,200 positions.Goldman had 49,100 employees at the end of the third quarter, after adding significant numbers of staff during the coronavirus pandemic.The layoffs are likely to affect most of the bank's major divisions, but should centre on Goldman Sachs' investment banking arm, one of the sources said.These new cuts will come on top of the earlier layoffs.Global banks, including Morgan Stanley and Citigroup Inc, have reduced their workforces in recent months as a dealmaking boom on Wall Street fizzled out due to high interest rates, tensions between the United States and China, the war between Russia and Ukraine, and soaring inflation.Global investment banking fees nearly halved in 2022, with $77 billion earned by the banks, down from $132.3 billion one year earlier, Dealogic data showed.The total value of mergers and acquisitions (M&A) globally had slumped 37% to $3.66 trillion by Dec. 20, according to Dealogic data, after hitting an all-time high of $5.9 trillion last year.Banks had executed $517 billion worth of equity capital markets (ECM) transactions by late December 2022, the lowest level since the early 2000s and a 66% drop from 2021's bonanza, according to Dealogic data.Despite the slowdown, Goldman's top dealmakers told Reuters in recent interviews that they are bullish on an M&A recovery in the second half of 2023.Share article on","['Goldman Sachs', 'Bloomberg News', 'Goldman', 'Goldman', ""Goldman Sachs'"", 'Morgan Stanley', 'Citigroup Inc', 'Dealogic', 'Dealogic', 'ECM', 'Dealogic', 'Goldman', 'Reuters']","['$77 billion', '$132.3 billion', '$3.66 trillion', '$5.9 trillion', '$517 billion']"

HDFC Capital raises $376 mn in latest affordable housing fund,09 January,"HDFC Capital Advisors Ltd, a wholly-owned unit of HDFC Ltd, has marked the initial close for Scheme 2 of its HDFC Capital Affordable Real Estate Fund–3 (H-CARE 3) at $376 million (around Rs 3,000 crore). This is the fourth fund raised by HDFC Capital for investments in affordable housing.A year ago, it had closed $1.88 billion of H-CARE 3, taking the Schemes 1 and 2 combined total estimated fund corpus to about $2.2 billion (including potential reinvestments). This has made H-CARE 3 one of the largest funds raised to invest in the residential real estate sector in India, the company said in a statement.The latest fundraise has taken HDFC-3’s Scheme 1 and 2 funds combined and H - CARE 1 and 2, raised in 2016 and 2017 respectively, to create a $3.1 billion funding platform, HDFC Capital said.The first two funds together have a corpus of over $1.1 billion targeting affordable and mid-income residential projects in India’s top 20 cities. H-CARE 3 will provide long-term, flexible equity and debt funding across the life cycle of affordable and mid-income housing projects including early-stage funding.

US private equity acquires taste for drug development,09 January,"North American private equity firms that deemed drug development too risky for their liking in the past are increasingly investing in the sector, raising dedicated funds and coming up with deals that compensate them for the uncertainty involved.These firms are seeking to capitalize on the growing gap between the supply of capital for clinical research and the number of drugs competing for it, eight buyout executives and investors interviewed by Reuters said.Annual spending on pharmaceutical research and development globally is projected to rise to $254 billion by 2026 from around $200 billion in 2020, according to Evaluate Pharma, a research firm focused on healthcare.These deals are not structured as the leveraged buyouts that private equity firms are mostly known for. Instead, the buyout firms invest in the development of the drugs, typically when they are in so-called Phase 3 clinical trials, one step away from regulatory clearance. They negotiate with pharmaceutical companies the returns they will receive in advance.In most cases, the drug makers start paying the money back to the private equity firms when the drug is being developed, either by issuing equity, tapping cash on hand or borrowing. They also share a slice of the newly developed drug's revenue with the private equity firms once it's approved.Blackstone Inc has been leading the charge, having made ten investments out of a $4.6 billion of a dedicated life sciences fund it launched in 2020.""Over the last ten years there have been many more products that have emerged that are really important to fund but less funding available by the pharma companies,"" said Blackstone's global head of life sciences Nick Galakatos.Among Blackstone's deals are a 300 million euro ($320 million) commitment to the development of Sanofi SA's immunotherapy drug Sarclisa, a $150 million investment in the advancement of Autolus Therapeutics Plc's pipeline of cancer treatments, and a check of up to $1.15 billion to back Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Inc's drugs for diseases including for tackling cholesterol. Some of these deals came with investments in the stock of the drug developers and loans to them.As its risk appetite for drug development grows, Blackstone has also been mulling the acquisition of companies with drugs still in clinical trials, as long as these companies also have some medicines that have hit the market, according to people familiar with the deliberations.Blackstone established a major presence in the sector in 2018 after acquiring Clarus, an investment firm specializing in clinical trial deals with $2.6 billion in assets. The strategy was emulated last year by Carlyle Group Inc when it acquired Abingworth, a peer of Clarus with $2 billion in assets.Carlyle is now preparing to raise a dedicated life sciences fund, using the Abingworth team, that could amass several billions of dollars, according to people familiar with the fundraising plans. Carlyle made its first clinical-trial investment last August, committing up to $170 million to back an Opthea Ltd eye drug under development.""We are big believers in what we've called the biopharma revolution and in the explosion of discovery and science,"" said Carlyle's global head of halthcare Steve Wise.Blackstone has been presenting its bets as relatively safe investments. It told high net-worth investors in 2021 that the drugs in Phase 3 it invested in had an 86% approval rate.Still, Blackstone's three-year-old life sciences fund has been off to a slow start when it comes to generating returns. It reported a net internal rate of return of just 2% as of the end of September, according to Blackstone's most recent quarterly earnings. By comparison, the predecessor fund that Clarus raised in 2018, before Blackstone took over, was delivering a 15% net internal rate of return as of the end of September.Carlyle has not disclosed Abingworth's returns and a spokesperson did not respond to a request for information on them.Other private equity firms racing to get a piece of the action include Apollo Global Management Inc, which last year acquired a minority stake in life sciences investment firm Sofinnova Partners and committed up to 1 billion euros in its funds, and EQT AB, which acquired Life Sciences Partners (LSP), a life sciences-focused venture capital firm, in 2021.VENTURE CAPITAL-STYLE BETSTo be sure, many private equity firms participate in the sector by just making venture capital-type investments in entire drug companies and allowing them to use the proceeds for their clinical trials. For example, KKR & Co Inc invested in gene-therapy company BridgeBio Pharma Inc in an early-stage funding round in 2016, funded the company through its initial public offering in 2019, and continues to be its largest shareholder.Private equity firms also provide capital to spin out drugs into new companies. Bain Capital, for example, created Cerevel Therapeutics by transferring Pfizer Inc's neurology drugs under development to a newly created company in a $350 million deal in 2018.""That is an example of taking an unloved asset out of a big company, providing funding and a big slug of capital, and creating a company that's got some diversity to it,"" said Tom Davidson, a partner focusing on the life sciences sector at investment bank PJT Partners Inc.Share article on",https://www.vccircle.com//usprivate-equity-acquires-taste-for-drug-development,Finance,"North American private equity firms that deemed drug development too risky for their liking in the past are increasingly investing in the sector, raising dedicated funds and coming up with deals that compensate them for the uncertainty involved.These firms are seeking to capitalize on the growing gap between the supply of capital for clinical research and the number of drugs competing for it, eight buyout executives and investors interviewed by Reuters said.Annual spending on pharmaceutical research and development globally is projected to rise to $254 billion by 2026 from around $200 billion in 2020, according to Evaluate Pharma, a research firm focused on healthcare.These deals are not structured as the leveraged buyouts that private equity firms are mostly known for.By comparison, the predecessor fund that Clarus raised in 2018, before Blackstone took over, was delivering a 15% net internal rate of return as of the end of September.Carlyle has not disclosed Abingworth's returns and a spokesperson did not respond to a request for information on them.Other private equity firms racing to get a piece of the action include Apollo Global Management Inc, which last year acquired a minority stake in life sciences investment firm Sofinnova Partners and committed up to 1 billion euros in its funds, and EQT AB, which acquired Life Sciences Partners (LSP), a life sciences-focused venture capital firm, in 2021.VENTURE CAPITAL-STYLE BETSTo be sure, many private equity firms participate in the sector by just making venture capital-type investments in entire drug companies and allowing them to use the proceeds for their clinical trials.","['Reuters', 'Clarus', 'Blackstone', 'Apollo Global Management Inc', 'Sofinnova Partners', 'EQT AB', 'Life Sciences Partners']","['$254 billion', 'around $200 billion', '$4.6 billion', '300 million euro', '$320 million', '$150 million', 'up to $1.15 billion', '$2.6 billion', '$2 billion', 'several billions of dollars', 'up to $170 million', '$350 million']"

"Nifty ends below 18,000 as Bajaj Finance weighs",05 January,"The Nifty 50 index ended below the 18,000 mark for the first time in nearly two weeks on Thursday as Bajaj Finance's disappointing quarterly update sparked a selloff in the high-flying financials sector.The Nifty 50 index finished 0.28% lower at 17,992.15, closing under the key 18,000-mark for the first time since Dec. 23.

‘Now Indian startups only take five years to hit $100 mn',05 January,"With India’s startup ecosystem maturing since the last decade, the time taken by new-age tech companies to reach $100 million revenue has reduced significantly, says a new study. The findings by consultancy firm Redseer Strategy Consultants underlined that the average time taken by startups to scale to $100 million has now come down to just five years in 2017 from 18 years in 2000. There are about 100 unicorns (startups with a valuation of $1 billion or more) and 170 soonicorns (a company with the potential to become a unicorn) in India. Of these 270 companies, more than 40 operating in fintech, ecommerce and logistics have crossed $100 million in revenue in the financial year 2022, the report said.  At present, India has close to 480 startups clocking more than $10 million in revenue while less than 60 new-age tech firms have an annual income in the range of $100 million to $1 billion. The study also pointed out the role of investors, particularly venture capitalists, in helping startups scale from zero to $100 million in revenue.  “Venture capital has played a central role in helping startups scale to the $100 million revenue milestone. Besides the capital, investors add tremendous value to the companies they fund. In addition, the knowledge of governance, financial prudence, and networks brought by VCs are invaluable for startups,” it said.  In total, VCs have invested about $143 billion over the last 15 years in the startup ecosystem, which is currently valued at $804 billion, as per the study’s estimates. At current valuations, it translates to approx. 4.5x return for VCs on their investments. Pointing out the challenges faced by most startups in their growth journeys, the study said those in niche industries restrict their total addressable market, while others need help with product-market fit and unsustainable growth. Startups in the red ocean market - the industries with well-defined market space and industry boundaries – operate in a highly competitive environment and need a unique competitive advantage to stay afloat, it added.  Challenges like poor profitability and bottlenecks with organization, governance, and operations are the reasons that even lead to the shutting down of startups, the study said.   Last year, 2,404 new-age tech companies winded up their operations, more than double the 1,012 that had shut shop in the previous year, according to data from Traxcn. Close to 266 startups that shut down this year were funded by venture capital, angel investors, family offices or institutional investors. The companies had raised close to $290 million, the data showed.Share article on",https://www.vccircle.com//nowindian-startups-only-take-five-years-to-hit-100-mn,Finance,"The findings by consultancy firm Redseer Strategy Consultants underlined that the average time taken by startups to scale to $100 million has now come down to just five years in 2017 from 18 years in 2000.At present, India has close to 480 startups clocking more than $10 million in revenue while less than 60 new-age tech firms have an annual income in the range of $100 million to $1 billion.",['Redseer Strategy Consultants'],"['$100 million', '$100 million', '$1 billion', '$100 million', 'more than $10 million', '$100 million to $1 billion', 'zero to $100 million', '$100 million', 'about $143 billion', '$804 billion', 'close to $290 million']"

Ltd, which runs automobile marketplace CarDekho, narrowed its loss to Rs 246.5 crore in the financial year 2022, down 28.1% from Rs 342.9 crore loss in the fiscal before, thanks to a sharp rise in its operational revenue. The Jaipur-headquartered company’s operating income grew 80.7% to Rs 1597.5 crore from Rs 884.3 crore in FY21. The growth in revenue, however, comes at the cost of a rise in expenses, which surged to Rs 2,170 crore in FY22 from Rs 1277.6 crore in the year-ago period. CarDekho is eyeing to achieve break even by FY24. “CarDekho expects to post Ebitda (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization)-level profitability by the third quarter of FY24. By then, “we are hoping for green shoots at a group level,” cofounder and chief executive Amit Jain told VCCircle last month in an interview. In FY22, the company’s employee benefits expense grew 32% to Rs 573.2 crore, compared to Rs 434.7 crore in FY21. The majority was spent on salaries and wages. It also spent Rs 408.2 crore in advertising and promotions in FY22, about 2.3x of Rs 177.6 crore in FY21. Founded in 2008 by siblings Amit Jain and Anurag Jain, CarDekho started as a car discovery platform for both new and old four-wheelers. It ventured into the pre-owned car retail market under the ‘Gaadi’ brand name in 2019, and more recently launched its lending vertical Rupyy.However, the company has scaled down its asset-heavy used car marketplace to pursue an auction model. It closed many retail stores in India since last year due to thin margins in the used marketplace business. “Globally, most of the used car marketplace models have collapsed. We also evaluated our own models on where it’s going to generate a profit pool. So, we’re now pursuing auction business where we buy cars from customers and auction them to the dealers,” Jain had said.The Sequoia-backed company also operates several automobile discovery platforms such as BikeDekho, Zigwheels, Gaadi, and Oto as well as university discovery platform CollegeDekho and price comparison portal PriceDekho. Besides India, it has a presence in Singapore, Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines.CarDekho is expecting an annual revenue rate of up to $26 million from Southeast Asia. “That market size is large because the average car value is higher, and the loan attachment rate is higher. This makes it a lucrative market,” Amit had said. CarDekho Group claims to have over 50 million visitors, more than 5,000 used-car loan agent partners, over 50,000 insurance partners in across 1,300 cities, and more than 3,500 used-car dealers as of March 2022. It also claims to have a war chest of over Rs 1,000 crore net cash.  ""On the public listing front, the company is aligning its activities across three workstreams – maintaining highest corporate governance standards, focusing on sustainability and charting out clear path to profitability with long-term value creation for all our stakeholders,"" said Mayank Gupta, group chief financial officer, CarDekho Group. The company last raised $250 million as part of its latest Series E round at a valuation of about $1.2 billion in October 2021. The round turned the company into a unicorn. The startup counts LeapFrog Investments, Mirae Asset Group, HDFC Bank, Hillhouse Capital, CapitalG and Ping An Global Voyager Fund as its investors.Share article on",https://www.vccircle.com//cardekhonarrows-loss-to-rs-247-crore-in-fy22,Finance,"Ltd, which runs automobile marketplace CarDekho, narrowed its loss to Rs 246.5 crore in the financial year 2022, down 28.1% from Rs 342.9 crore loss in the fiscal before, thanks to a sharp rise in its operational revenue.The growth in revenue, however, comes at the cost of a rise in expenses, which surged to Rs 2,170 crore in FY22 from Rs 1277.6 crore in the year-ago period.",['CarDekho'],"['up to $26 million', '$250 million', 'about $1.2 billion']"

Indian companies likely to raise funds via public issues in 2023 as cash tightens,29 December,"Fundraising through public issues could see an uptick in 2023 as retail investors bet on attractive

Uni Cards posts Rs 139.5 cr loss in FY22,29 December,"Uniorbit Technologies Pvt. Ltd, which operates buy-now-pay-later platform Uni, posted a net loss of Rs 139.5 crore in its first fully functional fiscal in FY22, as a result of a sharp rise in promotional and employee costs.Uni, which was incorporated in August 2020, started offering its services in May 2021. In FY21, it reported a loss of Rs 4.06 crore with no operational revenue. Its revenue from operations stood at Rs 13.7 crore in FY22, as per the company's annual financial statement with the Registrar of Companies (RoC). Mails sent to Uni remained unanswered till the time of publishing.Uni was founded by Nitin Gupta, who was previously the co-founder of PayU India and served in leadership positions at Bajaj Finserv and Ola Financial Services. The company raised $18.7 million in one of the largest seed funding rounds led by Lightspeed and Accel in October 2020, months before it launched its first product.The company also bagged $70 million as a part of its Series A round led by General Catalyst in December 2021 at a valuation of $350 million. It also counts Eight Roads Ventures, Elevation Capital, and Arbor Ventures as its backers.In FY22, the company’s total expenses ballooned to Rs 161.7 crore against Rs 6.51 crore in the previous fiscal. Its employee benefit cost grew more than eight times to Rs 33.2 crore from Rs 4.05 crore, as it expanded its team from just a handful of people to close to 250.At Rs 66.6 crore, Uni also spent a large proportion of its expenses on promotions in the last financial year. The cost was comparatively negligible in FY21 at just Rs 8.5 lakh, as the company was just starting out in the fiscal.Uni provided prepaid card products to its customers in partnerships with non-banking financial corporations (NBFCs) and banks. It started by offering Pay 1/3rd, which allowed customers to pay for goods in three EMIs over three months, with no extra charges. It came with Uni Pay 1/2 early this year, which allowed users to pay within two months at zero charges.Uni pitted against the likes of Slice and PayU-owned LazyPay in the BNPL segment.

Markets log best day in over three weeks in post sell-off jump,19 December,"Shares recorded their best day in over three weeks on Monday, led by gains in consumer and automotive stocks, after a sharp two-day selloff at the end of last week on fears of a global recession.The Nifty 50 index closed 0.83% higher at 18,420.45, and the S&P BSE Sensex rose 0.76% to 61,806.19. Both the benchmarks posted their biggest one-day gain since Nov. 24.The gains come after the two indexes fell a little more than 2% last Thursday and Friday on mounting fears that the U.S. Federal Reserve's mid-week announcement to keep raising interest rates would tilt the economy into a recession.

Markets end flat in volatile session ahead of inflation data,12 December,"Shares ended flat after struggling for direction for much of a volatile session on Monday, as investors braced for local retail inflation data and the U.S. Federal Reserve's monetary policy decision.The Nifty 50 index closed flat at 18,497.15, and the S&P BSE Sensex dipped 0.08% to end at 62,130.57.Both benchmarks fell 0.8% at the open before erasing losses later, though they struggled to move firmly in one direction, as they have since last week after the Reserve Bank of India hiked interest rates and took a hawkish stance.""The consolidation and intraday volatility, like in today's session, will continue ... as investors eye key events in the U.S. and domestic retail inflation data"", said Ajit Mishra, Vice President - Technical Research at Religare Broking.If the Nifty falls ""below 18,300, the resistance level, the tone would turn slightly bearish,"" he added.India's domestic consumer price inflation (CPI) likely cooled to a nine-month low of 6.40% in November, but stayed above the RBI's 2%-6% tolerance range for the tenth straight month, data at 5:30 p.m. IST is expected to show.US inflation data is due on Tuesday. While investors have largely priced in the 50 basis point (bps) rate hike from the Fed on Wednesday, the focus is on its economic projections, especially after some relatively strong data points last week.The US inflation scenario is also key for Indian IT companies as they get a big chunk of their revenue from that country. The Fed's rate hikes have led to fears of a U.S. recession and, as a result, an outsized hit to IT companies' results.HCL Technologies' revenue growth warning on Friday gave credence to those fears and sparked a tumble in IT stocks. IT was the top loser among the major sectoral indexes for the second consecutive session, shedding 0.40% on the day.Adding to the pressure, foreign institutional investors have remained net sellers for five sessions in a row through Friday — the longest since an eight-day streak that ended on Oct. 19.Financial stocks, the most heavily weighted among major sectors, rose 0.12% and helped steady the market.However, the midcap and small cap stocks closed 0.36% and 0.55% higher, respectively.Share article on",https://www.vccircle.com//marketsend-flat-in-volatile-session-ahead-of-inflation-data,Finance,"""The consolidation and intraday volatility, like in today's session, will continue ... as investors eye key events in the U.S. and domestic retail inflation data"", said Ajit Mishra, Vice President - Technical Research at Religare Broking.If the Nifty falls ""below 18,300, the resistance level, the tone would turn slightly bearish,"" he added.India's domestic consumer price inflation (CPI) likely cooled to a nine-month low of 6.40% in November, but stayed above the RBI's 2%-6% tolerance range for the tenth straight month, data at 5:30 p.m. IST is expected to show.US inflation data is due on Tuesday.IT was the top loser among the major sectoral indexes for the second consecutive session, shedding 0.40% on the day.Adding to the pressure, foreign institutional investors have remained net sellers for five sessions in a row through Friday — the longest since an eight-day streak that ended on Oct. 19.Financial stocks, the most heavily weighted among major sectors, rose 0.12% and helped steady the market.However, the midcap and small cap stocks closed 0.36% and 0.55% higher, respectively.Share article on","['Nifty', 'RBI']",[]

"Markets end at over 2-month low, IT stocks drag",09 December,"Global recession fear was back to haunt investors and IT stocks toppled sharply, extending their losses which took a heavy toll on Indian markets on Friday. Both Sensex and Nifty 50 dropped a little over 1% each. Smallcap stocks witnessed heavy selling pressure in the broader market. A broad-based selloff was recorded across sectoral indices with IT stocks emerging as the biggest underperformer. On the other hand, the rupee gained against the US dollar as the focus shifted toward Fed's next meeting where a softer tone in rate hike is on the cards.Sensex shed 389.01 points or 0.62% to end at 62,181.67, while Nifty 50 tumbled by 112.75 points or 0.61% to close at 18,496.60. The gains in FMCG stocks could not offset the sharp selloff in IT stocks. India's volatility index rose by nearly 0.6%.Stocks like HCL Tech, Tech Mahindra, Infosys, Wipro, and TCS were top 5 bears by falling in the range of 2-7%. Also, the downside in heavyweight Reliance Industries dragged the performance. Other stocks that witnessed a steep drop are -- Ultratech Cement, Tata Steel, Bajaj Finserv, and Bajaj Finance. On the other hand, top gainers were Nestle, Titan, Sun Pharma, and Dr. Reddy's Lab surging by over 1-2%.In the broader market, on BSE, the SmallCap index slipped by 1%. On the sectoral indices, the IT index dipped by 901.26 points or 2.98%. While some significant downfall was also recorded in capital goods and metal stocks which further added to woes.Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial said, ""Today's downfall in the domestic market was sparked by IT stocks extending their losses after warning of a potential slowdown in business on global recession fears. This was further aggravated by banks losing their grip as PSBs suffered heavy sell-offs. However, global bourses were largely positive, although the Fed is expected to raise interest rates by 50 basis points next week.""The domestic equities tumbled despite Asian peers rising with Hong Kong's Hang Seng emerging as the best performer as investors took comfort from China easing their strict COVID-19 restrictions. Also, the focus shifted toward US inflation data scheduled next week which is expected to provide some clarity on Fed's stance in the forthcoming policy.At the interbank forex market, after gaining to a session of 82.0950, the rupee ended at 82.27 against the US dollar on Friday compared to the previous day's closing of 82.42 per dollar. However, overall in the week, the rupee finished lower by at least 1.2% as the dollar sustained due to demand from corporates. Although the dollar has corrected substantially ahead of Fed's next policy meet where a 50 basis point is expected by the street, however, lower crude oil prices have pushed oil companies to bet on the greenback throughout the current week.This week, markets have been on a volatile note broadly even after RBI reduced the size of the hike in repo rate to 35 basis points. Currently, the repo rate is at its highest level since August 2018 at 6.25%. The softer 35 bps rate hike could not lift the market as RBI continued to stay on the 'withdrawal of accommodation' stance -- indicating that the battle for taming inflation is not over yet.Overall, in the current week, Sensex contracted by 1.09%, while Nifty 50 plummeted by 1.07% --- making it their biggest one-week fall since the week that ended 30 September.On Nifty 50, going forward, Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities said, ""On the daily chart, the index slipped below the recent consolidation, suggesting a rise in pessimism.

Uolo raises $22.5 million in Series A,09 December,"Edtech platform Uolo has raised $22.5 million in its Series A funding round led by UAE-headquartered venture capital fund Winter Capital. The funding round saw participation from existing investors Blume Ventures and the new Dubai-based fund Morphosis Venture Capital. Prior to this round, the company had previously raised seed funding of Rs 20 crore led by Blume Ventures in November 2020.Founded in 2013, Uolo partners with private schools and helps them develop online capabilities. It provides affordable programs aligned with school curriculums. The Gurugram-based company provides an open architecture platform which allows third-party education publishers and content creators to develop physical learning programs for K-12 schools and students. These programs usually come with a book, which the teacher uses during classes, as well as digital activities for students to complete at home, the company said in a statement. “The truth is that, after a few hours of play, rest and mandatory school homework, K-12 students do not have much time left. The edtech solutions need to build on top of the six hours spent in school daily and magnify the outcomes by leveraging the smartphones available at home. The lack of alignment with school, together with exorbitant pricing is causing edtech companies to falter”, said Pallav Pandey, co-founder and chief executive of Uolo. The company claims that it has partnered with more than 8,500 schools across India and currently reaches over 3.7 million students. It offers learning programmes in coding and English speaking. It plans to introduce more programs across STEAM subjects in the coming months.“The first wave of edtech companies in India have proven consumer interest in online education. However, they lacked a cost-effective distribution. We believe that there will be a new generation of edtech companies capable of building organic, low-cost distribution, allowing students to study at $10 per year rather than $10 per hour. Our investment in Uolo is based on our confidence in this type of company,” said Anton Farlenkov, managing director of Winter Capital.Winter Capital’s asset under management stands nearly at $1.4 billion across three funds. It focuses on growth equity investments across four select verticals: financial, healthcare, education, and consumer services. In 2022, India’s edtech sector witnessed an upheaval with the re-opening of schools and colleges. However, companies in the B2B edtech space were able to get decent interest from investors. For instance, in July, B2B edtech startup AntWalk raised $7.5 Mn in its Series A funding round led by GSV Ventures. Also, in March, Classplus, which provides a platform for educators to launch their online courses, raised $70 million.Share article on",https://www.vccircle.com//uoloraises-22-5-million-in-series-a,Finance,The edtech solutions need to build on top of the six hours spent in school daily and magnify the outcomes by leveraging the smartphones available at home.It plans to introduce more programs across STEAM subjects in the coming months.“The first wave of edtech companies in India have proven consumer interest in online education.,[],"['$22.5 million', '10', '$1.4 billion', '7.5', '$70 million']"

Expert view: RBI raises key policy rate by 35 basis points,07 December,"The Reserve Bank of India's key repo rate was raised by 35 basis points (bps) on Wednesday as widely expected, the fifth straight increase as inflation remains elevated, and the central bank says that there will be no let-up in flight to tame inflation.The monetary policy committee (MPC), comprising three members from the RBI and three external members, raised the key lending rate or the repo rate to 6.25% in a majority decision. Five of the six members voted in favour of the decision.The standing deposit facility rate and the marginal standing facility rate were also increased by the same quantum to 6.00% and 6.50%, respectively.COMMENTARYMARZBAN IRANI, CIO (DEBT), LIC MUTUAL FUND, MUMBAI""On initial thoughts is that today's MPC sounds hawkish – rate hiked by 35 bps, no change in stance and 5:1 voting are hawkish news. However, the pace of rate hikes is reducing from 50 bps to 35 bps, in line with expected global hikes.""""Yields are range bound between 7.25% to 7.35%. This calls for an investment opportunity in long-duration fixed income funds depending on risk appetite. Going ahead, we are expecting a 25 bps hike by April. The market needs to keep a close watch on global rate hikes and sticky core inflation.""DIPANWITA MAZUMDAR, ECONOMIST, BANK OF BARODA, MUMBAI""We expect that going forward, demand pressure to continue and this would indeed escalate price pressure. Even the pass-through of firms to consumers is yet to materialize as highlighted in the Q2 corporate results. In Nov '22 as well, price pressure in cereals, milk, pulses and spices persist, so considerable risk to headline CPI print cannot be ruled out completely.""""We expect RBI to go for another 25 bps hike in its next policy, with the terminal rate at 6.5%. Our CPI forecast stands at 6.8% and growth also at 6.8% for FY23.""LAKSHMI IYER, CEO-INVESTMENT ADVISORY, KOTAK INVESTMENT ADVISORS LIMITED, MUMBAI""The RBI MPC raised the repo rate by 35 basis points to 6.25% with a 5-1 vote. The stance remained focused on the withdrawal of accommodation. While this was ours as well as market consensus, it seems like we may not be fully done with the rate hiking cycle. The inflation guard continues to remain.""The U.S. Federal Reserve's FOMC outcome in the coming week remains key, Iyer said. ""Expect bond markets to give up some gains and trade rangebound as global growth concerns dominate.""SAKSHI GUPTA, PRINCIPAL ECONOMIST, HDFC BANK, NEW DELHI""The statement was slightly more hawkish than perhaps expected by markets, with no indication that the central bank is coming to the end of its rate hiking cycle for now.""""The reiteration of the fact that growth continues to be resilient while there are upside risks to inflation suggests the central bank's resolve to not let up its fight against inflation continues. This, at the margin, could provide soft support for the rupee — especially ahead of the U.S. Federal Reserve meeting next week. We continue to expect another rate hike in the Feb policy of 25 bps.""ANUJ PURI, CHAIRMAN, ANAROCK GROUP, MUMBAI""The 35 bps rate hike by the RBI - the fifth consecutive rate hike this year - comes as no surprise. With repo rates now at 6.25%, there may be some repercussions on housing uptake. This hike will undoubtedly push up home loan interest rates, which had already crept up after four consecutive rate hikes this year.""""However, as long as interest rates remain in single digits (mainly within 9.5%) the impact on housing will at best be moderate. If they breach this point, we will see some real pressure on residential sales volumes in the months to come, especially in the affordable and lower mid-range housing segments. The impact of the last four consecutive rate hikes early this year was minimal.""MADHAVI ARORA, LEAD ECONOMIST, EMKAY GLOBAL FINANCIAL SERVICES, MUMBAI""The MPC expectedly delivered a 35 bps hike, with a 5-1 vote, and kept its stance unchanged at 'withdrawal of accommodation'. The tone was still cautious and data-dependent, and with the governor emphasizing the need to calibrate the policy.""""At this point, we still think that the RBI would not turn too restrictive. However, the extent of global disruption will remain key. We are closely watching the global pace of inflation deceleration and how the impending recession will shape DM central bank policies, which could influence the RBI's reaction. The still-fluid global situation might require frequent adjustments in macro and policy assessments ahead as far as terminal rates are concerned.""UPASNA BHARDWAJ, CHIEF ECONOMIST, KOTAK MAHINDRA BANK, MUMBAI""The MPC delivered the 35 bps hike as expected while retaining the stance as 'withdrawal of accommodation.' We continue to expect the focus of MPC to remain in a watchful mode as uncertainties on inflation settle down.

Shriram Finance looking at rating upgrade post merger,05 December,"Shriram Finance Ltd, the merged non-bank financer of the Shriram group, expects a credit rating upgrade to AAA due to diversification of its merged portfolio, ultimately allowing it finer pricing on borrowings, said the lender’s executive vice-chairman Umesh Revankar.Shriram Transport Finance Company Ltd., Shriram City Union Finance Ltd., and Shriram Capital Ltd. were merged to form Shriram Finance Ltd.Before the merger, Shriram City Union Finance had a credit rating of AA, while Shriram Transport Finance was rated AA+.“Shriram City Union was one notch lower (than Shriram Transport) and following the merger, the portfolio will get upgraded from AA to AA+. To that extent, we get an advantage. As a diversified portfolio, you have a better chance of getting upgraded and we are working on that,"" Revankar said.A credit upgrade would allow the financier to get a 40-50 basis points (bps) advantage on its cost of borrowing, Revankar said. At present, its average cost of borrowing stands at 8.6%.“We are aiming at becoming a AAA-company. One of the observations that rating agencies have had in the past was of the company being a monoline and subject to cyclicality. Once that is addressed with a diversified portfolio, we believe it is possible,"" he said.The diversification, as a result of the merger, will be more in term o geographies, instead of products, he said.“We are still south-based and feel that the central, the western and the eastern regions of India are less penetrated.

Markets snap 8-day rally; Here's what is triggering the shade of red,02 December,"Taking a breather after hitting record highs in previous sessions, Indian stock market declined on Friday, snapping their eight-session rally, amid weak global cues, as investors secured profits ahead of US payrolls data that could provide more cues on a shift in the US Federal Reserve's rate-hike plans. Sensex fell to 62,715 while the Nifty 50 index shed to 18,650 in afternoon deals. “The key reasons for the fall in market is the correction in the US market, and we are falling because of that.

Therefore, the market is likely to consolidate around the present levels,"" he added.Technical view“From a short-term perspective, the momentum readings on the lower time frame chart have reached the overbought zone, which needs to cool-off. Such overbought situations generally lead to either a time-wise correction or a price-wise corrective phase in the short term. Hence, the risk reward to chase the index at current levels is not very favourable. But the broader markets have recently witnessed buying interest and are now showing some catch up move.

Aye Finance bags $10 mn from responsAbility,01 December,"Lending startup Aye Finance, on Thursday announced that it has raised $10 million via external commercial borrowings (ECBs) from its existing Swiss-based investor responsAbility Investments AG.Zurich-headquartered responsAbility, an asset manager for impact investments in emerging economies, has backed Aye since 2017, with the latest deal being the fifth debt investment for the fintech lender. Aye will be utilizing the additional funds to offer business loans to the excluded microenterprise sector to support their growth and enable their inclusion into the formal economy, the company said in a release. Founded in 2014, Aye provides business loans to small and micro enterprises across India, leveraging its artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) solutions in most of its critical business processes. The lender claims to be using its proprietary cluster-based credit assessment methodology coupled with AI algorithms for risk selection even in the absence of traditional business documentation. In the past few months, Aye appears to be on a fundraising spree. Early this month, the company raised about Rs 87 crore (about $10.7 million) in debt from Swiss impact investor BlueOrchard. In the last three months, the company has raised Rs 550 crore in debt, with Rs 65 crore coming from Symbiotics, which is a market access platform for impact investing. In the past, the lender has also raised capital from CapitalG, Elevation Capital, Light Rock, Alpha Wave, A91 Partners and MAJ Invest.“We are currently witnessing a surge in credit applications from the microenterprise sector as businesses are being rebuilt post the disruptions caused by the pandemic. The support we are receiving from global impact leaders like responsAbility allows us to continue in our mission of transforming microenterprise lending in India by providing entrepreneurs customized business loans at affordable prices,” said Sanjay Sharma, managing director and founder of Aye Finance.   Aye Finance posted a profit before tax of Rs 27.8 crore in the fiscal first half ended September, Sharma said in a recent interaction with VCCircle. He said the company also recorded a net profit during the period. In FY22, the company posted a net loss of Rs 67.4 crore as it chose to clean up bad loans accumulated due to the widespread business disruptions caused by the pandemic.“Aye has fully expensed out all the covid-related impairments in FY22. Thus, we have commenced FY23 on a clean slate and every quarter this year has shown high profitability,” Sharma said. Share article on",https://www.vccircle.com//ayefinance-bags-10-mn-from-responsability,Finance,"In the past, the lender has also raised capital from CapitalG, Elevation Capital, Light Rock, Alpha Wave, A91 Partners and MAJ Invest.“We are currently witnessing a surge in credit applications from the microenterprise sector as businesses are being rebuilt post the disruptions caused by the pandemic.In FY22, the company posted a net loss of Rs 67.4 crore as it chose to clean up bad loans accumulated due to the widespread business disruptions caused by the pandemic.“Aye has fully expensed out all the covid-related impairments in FY22.","['Elevation Capital', 'MAJ Invest', '“Aye']","['$10 million', 'about $10.7 million']"

India's Q2 GDP comes in at  6.3%,30 November,"The Indian economy has grown by 6.3% in the July to September quarter, down from explosive growth of 13.5% in the previous quarter, as distortions caused by Covid lockdowns faded, but the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) raised repo rates to combat inflationary pressure, official data revealed on Wednesday.Last year, the GDP growth rate was 8.4% in the July-September quarter.The National Statistical Office (NSO), under the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation, released the data on the quarterly estimates of the July-September period of the current financial year.The growth rate was above the 6.2% forecast by economists for the quarter, the second of India's 2022/23 financial year, in a poll.The data elaborated on the expansion of different sectors such as agriculture and manufacturing in the first quarter of this financial year.The Central government's capital spending increased over 40% as the federal government stepped up expenditure on infrastructure from roads to railways.Among key sectors, agricultural output rose 4.6% while manufacturing fell 4.3% and the employment-generating construction sector saw a 6.6% annual increase in activity.Nominal GDP or GDP at current prices in Q2 FY23 is estimated at ₹65.31 lakh crore, as against ₹56.20 lakh crore in Q2 FY22, showing a growth of 16.2% as compared to 19.0% in Q2 FY22.Views""The Q2 FY2023 GDP growth of 6.3% came in similar to our estimate of 6.5%, even as the GVA rise of 5.6% trailed our forecast (6.3%) by a wide margin, led by an unexpected contraction in manufacturing that seems to reflect the impact of high input prices on margins in certain sectors"" Aditi Nayar, Chief Economist at ICRA has said.""At the same time, GVA growth in agriculture, forestry and fishing has been estimated at above 4.0% for the third consecutive quarter, which seems somewhat optimistic based on the decidedly mixed first advance estimates of the kharif crop, that were followed by unseasonally heavy rainfall towards the end of the monsoon season,"" Nayar said.The ICRA Chief Economist also said, “GDP growth was boosted by the performance of private consumption expenditure and gross fixed capital formation, whereas government expenditure displayed a discouraging contraction in Q2 FY2023, on account of the modest de-growth in the Centre's non-interest revenue expenditure.""“With the Q2 FY2023 GDP growth only mildly below our forecast, we are retaining our estimate of the real GDP growth for FY2023 at 7.2%, although a deepening of the external slowdown poses a risk,"" Nayar added.Nish Bhatt, Millwood Kane International, said, “The Q2 growth at 6.3% vs 8.5% YoY is largely in line with the consensus estimates. The stable growth rate is largely on account of robust GST collection witnessed in the past few months, and the fact that we witnessed lower imports. The GVA growth correctly reflects the slowdown in activities like manufacturing, mining, and construction.""Investors await GDP dataShares closed at record highs for a fifth straight day today, extending their daily rally to seven days and logging a second straight month of gains, as investors cautiously awaited gross domestic product data.Many analysts believed that the Indian economy will expand at a single-digit rate mainly due to the waning base effect.Rating agency ICRA expected the GDP to grow at 6.5%, while the State Bank of India in its report pegged the growth rate at 5.8%.The RBI in its bulletin pegged the GDP growth at 6.1 to 6.3% in the second quarter of this fiscal year.The various GDP growth projections for the second quarter are either half or less than half of the 13.5% recorded in the April-June quarter this fiscal.The country's gross domestic product or GDP is derived from the sum of the gross value added (GVA) at basic prices, plus all taxes on products, less all subsidies on products.

"Chaayos' FY22 loss widens as focus towards hiring, Esop raises expenses",30 November,"Tiger Global-backed beverage chain Chaayos has reported a widening loss of Rs 71 crore for FY22 against Rs 52 crore in FY21, owing to multiple factors such as rise in hiring, employee benefits and higher marketing expenses.The company, however, has reported a 1.5x growth in its revenue for the period under review, to Rs 135 crore versus Rs 54.9 crore in FY21, according to filings with the Ministry of Corporate Affairs. This can be mainly attributed to the company's performance in its packaged product business.To capitalize on the work from home (WFH) and immunity boosting trend, Chaayos, in 2020, launched a series of instant & herbal chai products. It was also planning to launch 20 more products fundamentally around the vision `Meri Wali Chai’ under the packaged product portfolio. The cost of materials, however, accounted for the bulk of the expenses for Chaayos at Rs 53 crore in FY22, a 38% increase from the previous fiscal year.Chaayos has also increased its hiring as a consequence of which the cost centre saw a sharp rise. The employee benefit cost rose to Rs 51 crore in the current fiscal year as against Rs 31 crore in FY21, a 64% increase. The employee benefit costs also included Esop (Employee Stock Option Plan) which amounted to Rs 6.2 crore.  The rent for its outlets across Delhi-NCR, Mumbai and Bengaluru (during FY22) also increased to Rs 28 crore in FY22 as compared to Rs 20 crore in FY21.Lastly, advertising costs and commissions paid to selling agents grew to Rs 20 crore and 17 crore respectively in FY22.Chaayos competes with Bengaluru-based Mountain Trail Foods Pvt.

Chai Point has raised funding from Eight Roads, Paragon, Saama, and DSG Consumer. Founded in November 2012 by IIT Bombay alumnus Nitin Saluja and IIT Delhi alumnus Raghav Verma, Chaayos raised $53 million in a Series C funding round led by Alpha Wave Ventures in May this year.The company had also raised Rs 81 crore in a Series B round from SAIF Partners (now Elevation Capital), Hong Kong-based Integrated Capital and growth-stage Pactolus in September 2018.

"Oaktree, Hinduja and others bid for Reliance Cap; Advent stays away",29 November,"US private equity major Oaktree Capital, Hinduja Group and Ahmedabad-based Torrent - a consortium of Piramal and Cosmea Financial - have submitted their resolution plans for debt laden Reliance Capital (RCap). “The option 1 bidders are Hinduja, Torrent, Oaktree, Cosmea Financial and Piramal consortium, and UV ARC (asset reconstruction company) Ltd, who have submitted their resolution plans for Reliance Capital as a company,” said a person aware of the development.Piramal Enterprises Ltd has submitted a bid for Reliance General Insurance Company and Reliance Health Insurance under the corporate insolvency resolution process of RCap, along with a separate bid by Cosmea’s for RCap, on a several basis under limited liability terms, another person confirmed.Out of these five bidders, UV ARC has bid on a fee basis, which means that it has not submitted any resolution plan for RCap. It will further sell Rcap assets and make payments to lenders, as and when the sale happens, the person added. The deadline for submitting bids closed on Monday. Meanwhile, Zurich Insurance and US-based private equity investor Advent International, which had earlier submitted non-binding bids for Reliance General Insurance Company (RGIC) in the initial round, have stayed away in this final round. No separate bids were made for Reliance General Insurance Company and Reliance Nippon Life Insurance Company (Reliance Nippon Life). Advent had submitted a non-binding bid of Rs 7,000 crore for RGIC during the first round of the bidding. Other two players had placed 50% lower bids with Piramal quoting about Rs 3,600 crore, while Zurich’s offer stood at Rs 3,700 crore. Moreover, both Aditya Birla Sun Life Insurance and Nippon Life Insurance of Japan, who were fighting for RCap's 51% stake in the life insurance business, have also not submitted any bid for Reliance Nippon Life.  Nippon Life Japan has also not submitted a bid to increase its stake in the firm from 49% to 74%, as earlier planned. In the absence of separate bids for RGIC and Reliance Nippon Life, the Committee of Creditors (COC) design to stitch an Option -1 plan by combining the different bids of RCap clusters fails, the person quoted above said. The RCap lenders had given two options to the bidders. Under option 1, bidders were to bid for Reliance Capital as a company, and under option 2, multiple businesses of RCap including General Insurance, Life Insurance, Commercial Finance, Home Finance, Securities business, Reliance ARC and others were divided into eight different clusters. The objective of the cluster bidding was to first get separate bids for RGIC and Reliance Nippon Life, which account for over 90% of the total RCap value and then stitch them together to make the option 1 bidders compete against them. On 2 November, the RCap bidders had sought settlement of the Anil Ambani group company’s multiple legal issues totalling Rs 20,000 crore before the completion of the resolution plan. The bidders – including a consortium led by Piramal Enterprises, Hinduja Group and Zurich Insurance – took both the lenders and the administrator to the bankruptcy process, seeking to address the issue “immediately”.Last year in December, Reliance Capital, the financial services holding company of Anil Ambani-promoted Reliance Group, became the fourth financial services firm to be admitted for insolvency by a Mumbai bench of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT). Previously, Dewan Housing Finance Corporation Ltd (DHFL) in November 2019 and in October, two Srei Group firms were taken up for insolvency process.  Earlier this year, several large private investors including the likes of Brookfield, Ares SSG Capital, Edelweiss, Blackstone’s asset reconstruction arm, Multiples private equity, JC Flowers and Co, True North and TPG were among the 55 prospective resolution applications (PRAs) to have submitted expressions of interest (EOIs) to acquire RCap and its assets. Reliance Capital has over Rs 90,000 crore worth of assets under management (AUM) with more than one crore customers and 18,000 workforce.The deadline to complete the entire process ends on 31 January.Share article on",https://www.vccircle.com//oaktreehinduja-and-others-bid-for-reliance-cap-advent-stays-away,Finance,"“The option 1 bidders are Hinduja, Torrent, Oaktree, Cosmea Financial and Piramal consortium, and UV ARC (asset reconstruction company) Ltd, who have submitted their resolution plans for Reliance Capital as a company,” said a person aware of the development.Piramal Enterprises Ltd has submitted a bid for Reliance General Insurance Company and Reliance Health Insurance under the corporate insolvency resolution process of RCap, along with a separate bid by Cosmea’s for RCap, on a several basis under limited liability terms, another person confirmed.Out of these five bidders, UV ARC has bid on a fee basis, which means that it has not submitted any resolution plan for RCap.The bidders – including a consortium led by Piramal Enterprises, Hinduja Group and Zurich Insurance – took both the lenders and the administrator to the bankruptcy process, seeking to address the issue “immediately”.Last year in December, Reliance Capital, the financial services holding company of Anil Ambani-promoted Reliance Group, became the fourth financial services firm to be admitted for insolvency by a Mumbai bench of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT).","['Hinduja', 'Cosmea Financial', 'Piramal', 'Reliance Capital', 'Piramal Enterprises Ltd', 'Reliance General Insurance Company and Reliance Health Insurance', 'RCap', 'Cosmea', 'RCap', 'UV ARC', 'RCap', 'Piramal Enterprises', 'Hinduja Group', 'Zurich Insurance', 'Reliance Capital', 'Reliance Group', 'the National Company Law Tribunal']",[]
"Crypto lender BlockFi files for bankruptcy, cites FTX exposure",29 November,"Cryptocurrency lender BlockFi has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, it said on Monday, the latest industry casualty after the firm was hurt by exposure to the spectacular collapse of the FTX exchange earlier this month.The filing in a New Jersey court comes as crypto prices have plummeted. The price of bitcoin, the most popular digital currency by far, is down more than 70% from a 2021 peak.""BlockFi's Chapter 11 restructuring underscores significant asset contagion risks associated with the crypto ecosystem,"" said Monsur Hussain, senior director at Fitch Ratings.New Jersey-based BlockFi, founded by fintech executive-turned-crypto entrepreneur Zac Prince, said in a bankruptcy filing that its substantial exposure to FTX created a liquidity crisis. FTX, founded by Sam Bankman-Fried, filed for protection in the United States this month after traders pulled $6 billion from the platform in three days and rival exchange Binance abandoned a rescue deal.""Although the debtors' exposure to FTX is a major cause of this bankruptcy filing, the debtors do not face the myriad issues apparently facing FTX,"" said the bankruptcy filing by Mark Renzi, managing director at Berkeley Research Group, the proposed financial advisor for BlockFi. ""Quite the opposite.""BlockFi said the liquidity crisis was due to its exposure to FTX via loans to Alameda, a crypto trading firm affiliated with FTX, as well as cryptocurrencies held on FTX's platform that became trapped there. BlockFi listed its assets and liabilities as being between $1 billion and $10 billion.BlockFi on Monday also sued a holding company for Bankman-Fried, seeking to recover shares in Robinhood Markets Inc pledged as collateral three weeks ago, before BlockFi and FTX filed for bankruptcy protection.Renzi said BlockFi had sold a portion of its crypto assets earlier in November to fund its bankruptcy. Those sales raised $238.6 million in cash, and BlockFi now has $256.5 million in cash on hand.In a court filing on Monday, BlockFi listed FTX as its second-largest creditor, with $275 million owed on a loan extended earlier this year. It said it owes money to more than 100,000 creditors. The company also said in a separate filing it plans to lay off two-thirds of its 292 employees.Under a deal signed with FTX in July BlockFi was to receive a $400 million revolving credit facility while FTX got an option to buy it for up to $240 million.BlockFi's bankruptcy filing also comes after two of BlockFi's largest competitors, Celsius Network and Voyager Digital, filed for bankruptcy in July, citing extreme market conditions that had led to losses at both companies.Crypto lenders, the de facto banks of the crypto world, boomed during the pandemic, attracting retail customers with double-digit rates in return for their cryptocurrency deposits.Crypto lenders are not required to hold capital or liquidity buffers like traditional lenders and some found themselves exposed when a shortage of collateral forced them - and their customers - to shoulder large losses.BlockFi's first bankruptcy hearing is scheduled to take place on Tuesday. FTX did not respond to a request for comment.CREDITOR LISTBlockFi's largest creditor is Ankura Trust, which represents creditors in stressed situations and is owed $729 million. Valar Ventures, a Peter Thiel-linked venture capital fund, owns 19% of BlockFi equity shares.BlockFi also listed the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission as one of its largest creditors, with a $30 million claim. In February, a BlockFi subsidiary agreed to pay $100 million to the SEC and 32 states to settle charges in connection with a retail crypto lending product the company offered to nearly 600,000 investors.Bain Capital Ventures and Tiger Global co-led BlockFi's March 2021 funding round, BlockFi said in a press release issued at the time. Both firms did not immediately respond to a request for comment.In a blog post, BlockFi said its Chapter 11 cases will enable the company to stabilize its business and maximize value for all stakeholders.""Acting in the best interest of our clients is our top priority and continues to guide our path forward,"" BlockFi said.In its bankruptcy filing, BlockFi said it had hired Kirkland & Ellis and Haynes & Boone as bankruptcy counsel.BlockFi had earlier paused withdrawals from its platform.In a filing, Renzi said Blockfi intends to seek authority to honor client withdrawal requests from its customer wallet accounts, in which crypto assets are held in custody. However, the company did not disclose plans for how it might treat withdrawal requests from its other products, including interest-bearing accounts.""BlockFi clients may ultimately recover a substantial portion of their investments,"" Renzi said in the filing.ORIGINSBlockFi was founded in 2017 by Prince, currently the company's chief executive officer, and Flori Marquez. Though headquartered in Jersey City, BlockFi also has offices in New York, Singapore, Poland and Argentina, according to its website.In July, Prince had tweeted that ""it's time to stop puttingBlockFi in the same bucket / sentence as Voyager and Celsius.""""Two months ago we looked the 'same.' They shut down and have impending losses for their clients,"" he said.According to a profile of BlockFi published earlier this year by Inc, Prince was raised in San Antonio, Texas, and financed his college education at the University of Oklahoma and Texas State University with winnings from online poker tournaments. Before starting BlockFi with Marquez, he held jobs at Orchard Platform, a broker dealer, and at Zibby, a lease-to-own lender now called Katapult.Marquez previously worked at Bond Street, a small business lending outfit that was folded into Goldman Sachs in 2017, according to Inc.Share article on",https://www.vccircle.com//cryptolender-blockfi-files-for-bankruptcy-cites-ftx-exposure,Finance,"The company also said in a separate filing it plans to lay off two-thirds of its 292 employees.Under a deal signed with FTX in July BlockFi was to receive a $400 million revolving credit facility while FTX got an option to buy it for up to $240 million.BlockFi's bankruptcy filing also comes after two of BlockFi's largest competitors, Celsius Network and Voyager Digital, filed for bankruptcy in July, citing extreme market conditions that had led to losses at both companies.Crypto lenders, the de facto banks of the crypto world, boomed during the pandemic, attracting retail customers with double-digit rates in return for their cryptocurrency deposits.Crypto lenders are not required to hold capital or liquidity buffers like traditional lenders and some found themselves exposed when a shortage of collateral forced them - and their customers - to shoulder large losses.BlockFi's first bankruptcy hearing is scheduled to take place on Tuesday.In February, a BlockFi subsidiary agreed to pay $100 million to the SEC and 32 states to settle charges in connection with a retail crypto lending product the company offered to nearly 600,000 investors.Bain Capital Ventures and Tiger Global co-led BlockFi's March 2021 funding round, BlockFi said in a press release issued at the time.","['FTX', 'FTX', 'BlockFi', 'BlockFi', 'BlockFi', 'BlockFi', 'SEC', 'Bain Capital Ventures', 'BlockFi', 'BlockFi']","['$6 billion', 'between $1 billion and $10 billion', '$238.6 million', '$256.5 million', '$275 million', '$400 million', 'up to $240 million', '$729 million', '$30 million', '$100 million']"
Digital disbursements up 3x in Q2: Report,29 November,"Disbursements by digital lending platforms more than tripled during Q2FY23 to Rs 14,016 crore, compared to Q2FY22, according to a report by Fintech Association for Consumer Empowerment (FACE), an industry association and self-regulatory body for fintech lenders. FACE, a non-profit organization, represents more than 50% of the digital lending businesses in the country. The growth comes on a low base after business took a hit during the second wave of pandemic. Volume of disbursements for Q2FY23 also doubled, growing to 1.62 crore from 65.56 lakh previously. “The credit expansion witnessed this quarter demonstrates that the fintech industry is seizing opportunities to contribute to financial inclusion and an inclusive economy. The fintech lending industry is accelerating customers’ access to credit with more loans,” said Sugandh Saxena, chief executive, FACE, in a statement. The report showed that the average ticket size (excluding outliers at extreme ends of low- and high-ticket sizes) was around Rs 12,368 with marginal increase of about 5% over last year. However, this varies amongst lenders due to the widely different focus on products and customer segments. “A number of factors, including the cost of funds, operations and risk profile of customers, influence the pricing for the customers,” the report noted. The processing fee ranged between 1.1% to 5.3% and the interest rate the lender charged was between 14.5% to 38.3%. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is now actively working to protect consumers interest, asking fintech lenders to follow guidelines and regulations around lending including the digital lending guidelines. “Implementation of the RBI’s digital lending brings tailwinds for the industry as it sets clear rules and standards, boosting the confidence of the customers, fintech lenders and other market participants. Proactive efforts by multiple stakeholders to crack down on dubious lending apps are improving the ecosystem with greater customer trust and expanding the market for legitimate players,” she said. Share article on",https://www.vccircle.com//digitaldisbursements-up-3x-in-q2-report,Finance,"“A number of factors, including the cost of funds, operations and risk profile of customers, influence the pricing for the customers,” the report noted.“Implementation of the RBI’s digital lending brings tailwinds for the industry as it sets clear rules and standards, boosting the confidence of the customers, fintech lenders and other market participants.",['RBI'],[]

BharatPe sees multiple CXO exits,28 November,"Three senior executives have resigned from BharatPe, two people aware of the matter told Mint. Vijay Aggarwal, chief technology officer; Nehul Malhotra, head, PostPe and Rajat Jain, chief product officer for lending and consumer products, have tendered their resignations.Aggarwal, who has been with BharatPe since March 2020, has quit “to start his own venture,"" the people quoted above said. Former Paytm executives Jain and Malhotra are ""also moving out to pursue their own entrepreneurial journey,"" the persons added.Some two to three exits have also happened at the mid-managerial level, including those of Geetanshu Singla, VP-technology, and Manas Poddar, who was programme manager at BharatPe.“We confirm that Vijay, Rajat, Nehul and Geetanshu are moving on from BharatPe to pursue their entrepreneurial passions. They will continue to ensure smooth transition of their role to the designated leaders. While it is difficult to part ways with these fantastic leaders, we are also proud of them for having taken the entrepreneurial plunge. We wish them all the best and would continue to cheer for them as they build their next ventures. BharatPe has an incredible leadership bench, and has continued to strengthen and build it over the last 12 months, with key senior hires in product, technology, data science, finance and HR,"" a BharatPe spokesperson said responding to Mint's query on this.Since the beginning of 2022, BharatPe has been mired in controversies and seen quite a few top-level exits. First it was Ashneer Grover, who was ousted over allegations of financial irregularities.In June, the company’s chief revenue officer Nishit Sharma left. The same month, BharatPe’s founding member Satyam Nathani, who was one of the most important members of the tech team, also resigned to pursue his entrepreneurial ambitions.The biggest setback was the exit of Bhavik Koladiya. He ran the tech and product of the fintech giant and ended his association with the company in the last week of June. Koladiya, who is just a high-school graduate, had been running BharatPe’s tech from the start. He led a 60-member tech and product team. Apart from managing BharatPe’s tech, an agreement was put in place where Koladiya would have offered tech consulting to the Unity Small Finance Bank – a joint venture between Centrum and BharatPe.Over last few months, most exits have been from BharatPe’s tech and product team, and as such would likely have an impact on the Unity Bank venture which is dependent on BharatPe for its technology expertise.In fact, Koladiya, Nathani and Vijay Aggarwal were set to play an important role in Unity SFB, for which BharatPe is expected to contribute as a technology service provider.These exits come at a time when the fintech company is transitioning itself into a professionally-run entity. BharatPe, which is currently focused on achieving profitability, is also preparing for an IPO in 18-24 months.BharatPe was started in July 2017 and was incorporated in March 2018 by Koladiya and Shashvat Nakrani, who was then studying at IIT-Delhi, as co-founders with each owning 50% stake. Three months later in June 2018, Grover joined as the third co-founder. In August 2021, the company entered the unicorn club after raising $370 million led by Tiger Global.

Udaan bags fresh debt from EvolutionX after recent fundraise,24 November,"Business-to-business marketplace Udaan has raised $40 million in fresh debt funding from early-stage financier EvolutionX Debt Capital, a person aware of the development told VCCircle. The investment follows the $120 million fundraise by the company a fortnight ago.“With this, the total funds raised by Udaan in the last four quarters have reached $400 million,” the individual cited above further said. The latest investment, alongside Udaan’s recent capital raise, will improve the company’s financial strength as well as continue to drive its operational efficiencies with an enhanced focus on achieving profitable growth, EvolutionX said in a release. In early November 2022, EvolutionX announced its maiden debt investment in API Holdings, the parent company of PharmEasy. In January, Udaan raised $250 million, comprising $200 million worth of convertible notes or short-term debt that can subsequently be converted to equity and $50 million of debt. M&G Prudential, Kaiser Permanente, Nomura, TOR, Arena Investors, Samena Capital and Ishana Capital backed the firm in the round which saw Microsoft Corporation’s participation in April. Founded in 2016 by former Flipkart employees Amod Malviya, Sujeet Kumar, and Vaibhav Gupta, Udaan is a B2B trade platform catering to small and medium businesses in India.Traders, wholesalers, retailers, and manufacturers can connect on Udaan's platform, where they can look for customers, suppliers, and products across categories and communicate with one another directly for the lowest price. The platform has over 3 million retailers registered across various categories including lifestyle, electronics, home and kitchen, staples, fruits and vegetables, FMCG, pharma and general merchandise.The company is backed by the likes of Octahedron Capital, Moonstone Capital, Lightspeed Venture Partners, DST Global, GGV Capital, Altimeter Capital and Tencent, among others. Udaan is aiming to go public over the next 12-18 months, the company's chief financial officer Aditya Pande told employees in an internal email sent last month.“We believe in efficiency as a driver of profitable growth and will continue to refine our cost structures and models. In this direction, we have taken numerous steps, with enhanced digital capabilities, to achieve efficiency and scale, become more agile and remain competitive in the marketplace,” it said.  The company’s unit economics improved by around 1,000 basis points with equally strong improvements in gross margins and operating cost, Pande pointed out in the email reviewed by VCCircle. “The journey of right business design and unit economics has translated into more than 60% reduction in the burn,” the mail read. Earlier this month, Udaan said that it is firing up to 350 employees in the second round of layoffs since June, as the startup aimed to further improve its efficiency and achieve profitability.“As we move forward in our journey towards making Udaan a profitable company, the efficiency enhancement drive and the evolution in business model has created some redundancies in the system, with some roles no longer required,” the company had said. Share article on",https://www.vccircle.com//udaanbags-fresh-debt-from-evolutionx-after-recent-fundraise,Finance,"The investment follows the $120 million fundraise by the company a fortnight ago.“With this, the total funds raised by Udaan in the last four quarters have reached $400 million,” the individual cited above further said.Earlier this month, Udaan said that it is firing up to 350 employees in the second round of layoffs since June, as the startup aimed to further improve its efficiency and achieve profitability.“As we move forward in our journey towards making Udaan a profitable company, the efficiency enhancement drive and the evolution in business model has created some redundancies in the system, with some roles no longer required,” the company had said.",['Udaan'],"['$40 million', '$120 million', '$400 million', '$250 million', '$200 million', '$50 million']"

Prosus turns conservative on Byju's as stake falls below 10%,23 November,"South African technology investor Prosus NV has taken a conservative accounting stance for its stake in Byju’s parent Think & Learn Pvt. Ltd, valuing the Indian edtech firm at almost the same cost as its initial investment of about $578 million.Prosus, however, reported high growth metrics across its other investments in the edtech sector, as well as Swiggy, InstaMart and PayU, its other portfolio companies in India.“In September 2022, the group lost significant influence in Byju’s as it no longer exerts significant influence over the financial and operating policies of the entity,” Prosus said in its financial statement for the six months ended 30 September, issued on Wednesday.The loss of “influence” is attributed to the investor stake falling below 10%, said a person familiar with the matter.“In case of Prosus, since its shareholding fell below 10% in Think & Learn (the parent of Byju’s), it lost certain rights and resultant influence on the company. In such cases, the accounting changes and the fund then values the stake at cost (the price at which it bought the stake),” the person cited above said.Prosus said the fair value of Byju’s was done by a third-party firm, wherein it has valued its 9.67% stake in Byju’s at $578 million, which assigns a conservative valuation of  $5.97 billion to Byju’s.“The group accounts for its retained interest in the Byju’s investment at fair value through other comprehensive income. This change from accounting for Byju’s as an associate is because the provision of Byju’s audited financials did not align with the timing of the close of our financial reporting periods, so we did not have sufficient information to make fair assumptions for our Group’s financial statements,” a Prosus spokesperson said in a statement.Byju’s was valued at over $22 billion by investors earlier this year.Prosus’ stake in Byju’s stood at 10.57% as of April 2021, before falling to 9.81% as of April 2022, and 9.67% as of September. The investor’s stake in Byju’s diluted as the edtech firm made fresh fundraising including from founder Byju Raveendran.Prosus also noted that barring its trading losses of $178 million, “reflecting one-off adjustments to its edtech associates (investments) Byju’s and Udemy”, the overall edtech portfolio performed strongly this year, with revenue growing 38% to $334 million.Prosus also lost significant influence in US edtech firm Udemy as it lost its board representation, accounting its 12.16% stake at fair value of $207 million.“We have stopped equity accounting for Byju’s and Udemy from September 2022,” Prosus said.In India, Prosus is also an investor in Swiggy, Meesho, PharmEasy, Eruditus, Elastic Run and Urban Company, among others. The investor reported high growth in Swiggy and PayU.“Our share of Swiggy’s revenue grew faster at 72% to US$150m, reflecting higher average order values and increased revenue from delivery fees and advertising sales,” it said.Similarly, Prosus said consolidated revenue of India-focused PayU grew revenue 33% (H122 57%) to $412m, led by growth in payments in India and Turkey, and a scaling credit business in India.At Swiggy, the core restaurant food delivery business delivered order growth and GMV (Gross Merchandise Value) growth of 38% and 40% respectively for the first six months of the year. Total quick commerce and GMV grew 20 times and 15 times respectively during the first six months of the year, Prosus said.“Our share of Swiggy’s trading loss increased to US$105m (compared to H1 FY22: US$34m), driven by investment in both the core restaurant food delivery business to increase growth and in Instamart to expand its footprint,” Prosus said.At PayU, Prosus said trading losses expanded to $80m from $27m in H1FY21 as it invested in credit and new payment products.Overall, consolidated revenue at PayU grew 57% to $412 million on the back of growth in payments in India, Turkey and Poland, as well as scaling of the credit business in India.“In India, our largest payments market, TPV (Total Payment Volume) grew 59% to US$28bn, and revenue increased 48% to $183 million, following increased digitalisation in ecommerce, financial services and bill payments, and a rebound in post pandemic travel,” Prosus said.Last month, Prosus terminated its $4.7 billion agreement to acquire payments provider BillDesk.The group said it focuses on “meaningful businesses in the online classifieds, food delivery, payments and fintech, and education technology sectors in markets including India and Brazil”.Share article on",https://www.vccircle.com//prosusturns-conservative-on-byju-s-as-stake-falls-below-10-,Finance,"Ltd, valuing the Indian edtech firm at almost the same cost as its initial investment of about $578 million.Prosus, however, reported high growth metrics across its other investments in the edtech sector, as well as Swiggy, InstaMart and PayU, its other portfolio companies in India.“In September 2022, the group lost significant influence in Byju’s as it no longer exerts significant influence over the financial and operating policies of the entity,” Prosus said in its financial statement for the six months ended 30 September, issued on Wednesday.The loss of “influence” is attributed to the investor stake falling below 10%, said a person familiar with the matter.“In case of Prosus, since its shareholding fell below 10% in Think & Learn (the parent of Byju’s), it lost certain rights and resultant influence on the company.Total quick commerce and GMV grew 20 times and 15 times respectively during the first six months of the year, Prosus said.“Our share of Swiggy’s trading loss increased to US$105m (compared to H1 FY22: US$34m), driven by investment in both the core restaurant food delivery business to increase growth and in Instamart to expand its footprint,” Prosus said.At PayU, Prosus said trading losses expanded to $80m from $27m in H1FY21 as it invested in credit and new payment products.Overall, consolidated revenue at PayU grew 57% to $412 million on the back of growth in payments in India, Turkey and Poland, as well as scaling of the credit business in India.“In India, our largest payments market, TPV (Total Payment Volume) grew 59% to US$28bn, and revenue increased 48% to $183 million, following increased digitalisation in ecommerce, financial services and bill payments, and a rebound in post pandemic travel,” Prosus said.Last month, Prosus terminated its $4.7 billion agreement to acquire payments provider BillDesk.The group said it focuses on “meaningful businesses in the online classifieds, food delivery, payments and fintech, and education technology sectors in markets including India and Brazil”.Share article on","['Swiggy', 'InstaMart', 'Prosus', 'Think & Learn', 'Byju’s', 'GMV', 'Swiggy', 'H1FY21', 'TPV', 'Prosus']","['about $578 million', '$578 million', '$5.97 billion', 'over $22 billion', '$178 million', '$334 million', '$207 million', '150', '412', '105', 'US$34', '80', '27', '$412 million', '$183 million', '$4.7 billion']"
SEBI halts fresh commitments into funds with priority distributions,23 November,"Securities Exchange Board of India (Sebi) has put a halt to Alternative Investment Funds (AIFs) with a priority distribution model from accepting fresh commitments, the markets regulator said on Wednesday evening.    A priority distribution model allows some investors to exit ahead of others, which is currently not against the law as it is not explicitly restricted in AIF Regulations mandated by the regulator.  However, this is likely to change. On Wednesday, Sebi noted that some schemes of AIFs have been allowing a waterfall distribution in such a way that a set of investors “share loss more than pro rata to their holding” in comparison to other investors as the latter is allowed to exit the AIF earlier than the former.   While this is not a violation of the Sebi AIF regulations according to the current regime,  the “regulator believes it is unfair and unethical,” a person familiar with regulator’s thinking said. This allowed losses to be passed on to others in a disproportionate manner, ifsome other investors within the AIF have been allowed to exit on priority""We have seen that sometimes one class of investors have a better bargaining power than the another and hence they are able to procure better rights or protection mechanism, through better waterfall mechanisms. This is generally not asked for by the former class in order to provide undue advantage to the latter class, but to ensure that their investments are protected. However, eventually, it may become disadvantageous to one class,"" said Dipti Lavya Swain, founder and managing partner, DLS Law Offices. “The aforesaid matter is being examined by Sebi in consultation with Alternative Investment Policy Advisory Committee, AIF industry associations and other stakeholders. Meanwhile, it has been decided that schemes of AIFs which have adopted aforesaid priority distribution model, shall not accept any fresh commitment or make investment,"" Sebi said in its circular. Sebi’s adverse stance on “priority payouts” was first reported by Mint on 14 September.“Why should priority payouts happen? Don’t you want AIFs to be as safe as other equity investments?” Ashwani Bhatia, a whole-time director, Sebi, said in an interview with Mint on the sidelines of an event organized by the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry on 14 September.At the time Mint had also reported that the regulator is probing as many as 20 AIFs for a series of violations which included dividend stripping, inadequate diversification, abrupt change in control at AIFs, non-adherence to stated investment mandate, conflicts of interest, valuation policies, priority payouts, and outsourcing management (of investments) to other entities.  Share article on",https://www.vccircle.com//sebihalts-fresh-commitments-into-funds-with-priority-distributions,Finance,"On Wednesday, Sebi noted that some schemes of AIFs have been allowing a waterfall distribution in such a way that a set of investors “share loss more than pro rata to their holding” in comparison to other investors as the latter is allowed to exit the AIF earlier than the former.Don’t you want AIFs to be as safe as other equity investments?” Ashwani Bhatia, a whole-time director, Sebi, said in an interview with Mint on the sidelines of an event organized by the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry on 14 September.At the time Mint had also reported that the regulator is probing as many as 20 AIFs for a series of violations which included dividend stripping, inadequate diversification, abrupt change in control at AIFs, non-adherence to stated investment mandate, conflicts of interest, valuation policies, priority payouts, and outsourcing management (of investments) to other entities.","['AIFs', 'AIF', 'Mint', 'the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry', 'Mint', 'AIFs']",[]

Climate Angels invests in Clean Electric,21 November,"Angel investment syndication platform for pollution reduction and climate tech startups Climate Angels has invested in Clean Electric, an energy storage solutions startup, and helped it raise $2.2 million in a seed round led by Kalaari Capital.The round also saw participation from LV Fund, 7Square Ventures, and CIIE Regional Innovation Foundation.Clean Electric’s proprietary battery technology seeks to address pressing safety and performance issues for EVs like battery fires, long charging times and frequent battery replacement. With the funding received, Clean Electric plans to set up a manufacturing facility in Pune to produce 5,000 battery packs per month.Founded in 2020, Clean Electric manufactures, designs, develops, markets, supplies and provides after-sales of advance energy storage solutions for mobility & stationary storage applications as well as related energy infrastructure & services. The company has built liquid-cooled battery solutions for 2 Wheelers, 3 Wheelers, and Battery Swapping applications.The company’s products have been in pilot testing with multiple vehicle OEMs across the country, having undergone more than 30,000 Kms of on-road testing. Compliant with AIS-156 Phase 2 guidelines (to be implemented from March 2023), the products are expected to be ready for certification tests before year-end.Clean Electric also plans to use the funds towards expanding its R&D, sales, & operations teams, as well as for developing new products around faster charging, renewable energy storage, and battery swapping.Overall, EV penetration is less than 2%. In order to transition to an all-electric future, India needs robust electric vehicles and charging infrastructure. Current EVs take 3-4 hours to charge making it inconvenient for users, while unpredictable battery life makes it difficult for the NBFCs & Banks to finance these vehicles. On top of this, multiple reputed EV OEMs vehicles’ catching fire & resulting casualties have eroded the confidence of customers and created safety concerns in their mind.“Our aim is to enable Mankind’s shift from Fossil Fuels, and batteries have been the hardest part of this transformation.

"SEBI asks AIFs to segregate, ring-fence assets of each scheme",17 November,"The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) has made it mandatory for alternative investment funds, which includes private equity (PE) and venture capital (VC) firms, to segregate and ring-fence assets and liabilities of each scheme from others. “The manager and either the trustee or the trustee company or the board of directors or designated partners of the AIF, as the case may be, shall ensure that the assets and liabilities of each scheme of an AIF are segregated and ring-fenced from other schemes of the AIF; and bank accounts and securities accounts of each scheme are segregated and ring-fenced,” Sebi said in an official gazette dated 15 November. The capital market regulator has notified the amendment in SCRA (AIFs) Regulations, 2012.The latest order is similar to what the market regulator did in December 2020 after Franklin Templeton wound up six of its mutual fund schemes without obtaining the consent of its investors by a simple majority. “All assets and liabilities of each scheme shall be segregated and ring-fenced from other schemes of the MF,” Sebi had ordered.With the latest decision, Sebi has ensured that investors of one AIF scheme won’t get impacted when the other scheme operated by the same AIF goes bust or faces tremendous losses. Put simply, ring-fencing will prevent AIFs from using the funds or assets of a scheme to settle their debts and offset them against losses in the corresponding schemes.The move will provide more confidence to limited partners (LPs) to invest in schemes operated by a PE or VC fund. LPs in such schemes are high-net-worth individuals, pension funds, family offices, sovereign funds and insurance companies. Meanwhile, in its latest order, Sebi has also made it mandatory for AIFs to submit a fresh application for a scheme launch if it fails to declare the first close of the scheme in the manner prescribed. Share article on",https://www.vccircle.com//sebiasks-aifs-to-segregate-ring-fence-assets-of-each-scheme,Finance,"“The manager and either the trustee or the trustee company or the board of directors or designated partners of the AIF, as the case may be, shall ensure that the assets and liabilities of each scheme of an AIF are segregated and ring-fenced from other schemes of the AIF; and bank accounts and securities accounts of each scheme are segregated and ring-fenced,” Sebi said in an official gazette dated 15 November.“All assets and liabilities of each scheme shall be segregated and ring-fenced from other schemes of the MF,” Sebi had ordered.With the latest decision, Sebi has ensured that investors of one AIF scheme won’t get impacted when the other scheme operated by the same AIF goes bust or faces tremendous losses.","['AIF', 'AIF', 'AIF', 'AIF', 'AIF']",[]

According to a company spokesperson, the number is expected to be north of Rs 19 crore but it did not specify by how much.  The company reported an 88.5% jump in its consolidated revenue from operations in FY22, at Rs 1,904.4 crore against nearly Rs 1,010.2 crore in FY21, according to its latest filing with the Ministry of Corporate Affairs.  “Our strong FY22 performance is a result of growth coming from new business lines, continued expansion as well growth from the e-commerce market. The result reflects our constant and continuing efforts to remain focused on creating value for our stakeholders, through continued operational efficiency, profitability, and being resilient for our customers, people and partners,” Saha added. In February, the logistics player bagged a Series F funding of $300 million led by Blackstone Growth, TPG Growth and ChrysCapital at $1.2 billion valuation, VCCircle had reported.  In August, VCCircle reported that late-stage investor Avendus Future Leaders Fund acquired a stake in the recently turned unicorn from existing investor Elevation Capital, via a secondary transaction for Rs 195 crore.    The logistics unicorn’s total expenses in FY22 shot up nearly 80% at Rs 1,957 crore while it spent over Rs 1,088 crore in the last fiscal, its filing showed.  The company incurred about 88% higher miscellaneous expenses in FY22 at Rs 1,506.2 crore versus Rs 828.6 crore in FY21.  The logistics player spent about 41% more on advertising and promotion expenses in FY22 at Rs 8.8 crore against Rs 6.2 crore in the year ended March 2021.

Its expenditure on Esops (employee stock ownership plan) jumped to Rs 7.7 crore during the period ended March 2022, against Rs 18.9 lakh in FY21.   Set up in 2015 by Saha and Supam Maheshwari, the platform claims that currently it is spread across 3,000 cities and caters to sectors such as e-commerce, pharmaceuticals, fast-moving consumer goods, retail, manufacturing, electronics and consumer durables. The company also claims to be delivering over 1.5 million packages per day, in over 20,000 pin codes.  The company started as the logistics arm of Pune-based baby products retailer FirstCry about 10 years ago. The business was spun out from FirstCry and the platform commenced independent operations in September 2015.        It raised its first round of funding the same year, from venture capital investors such as SAIF Partners and Chiratae Ventures.  In the logistics segment, the company competes against the likes of Shiprocket and listed Delhivery.

"October retail inflation eases, spurs smaller rate hike views",15 November,"India's retail inflation eased to a three-month low of 6.77% in October, helped by a slower rise in food prices and a higher base effect, strengthening bets of smaller rate hikes by the country's central bank at its meeting next month.The October reading was higher than the 6.73% forecast by economists in a Reuters poll and above the central bank's tolerance limit, data released by the National Statistics Office on Monday showed.

Masterkey Capital was the investment banker for the deal. The Pune-headquartered firm plans to use the capital to improve product and enhance its offerings. It also plans to expand internationally, starting with Southeast Asian markets, convinced by the credit-worthy population in these areas. It will be operational in Indonesia, the Philippines, and Vietnam by the beginning of next quarter and in two more economies going forward. The company also plans to expand to the US. To complement its capabilities, Lentra is also looking to acquire companies in data solutions, robotics process automation and payments solutions. The company is looking to stock deals rather than a cash deal, Venkatesh said. “We believe we will be able to assimilate one or two based on size or promise disparity,” he added. Founded in 2019 by Venkatesh and Ankur Handa, Lentra allows banks to embrace digital processes through its software-as-a-service offering. Its Lentra Lending Cloud offers ready-to-use third-party API (application programming interface) connectors to various data sources that banks use for underwriting purposes. It has more than 50 clients in India and will be using the funding to expand overseas. “We see a massive opportunity for ourselves in the retail assets and business banking areas worldwide. Our clients see us as a source of competitive advantage for their business. Some of the biggest retail banks as our clients now, act as markers of our solution architecture,” said Venkatesh. Lentra claims that more than 40 banks and processes use its lending cloud services for over 3 million applications monthly. It also claims to have processed more than 13 billion transactions and $21 billion worth of loans on its platform so far.Currently a team of about 500 people, Lentra would be a 700-member team in a year. “Lentra is our first fintech investment in India. As a global bank, we look forward to Lentra scaling their products and platform internationally,” said Everett Leonidas, director and Asia-Pacific lead investor for Citi Ventures. In the financial year 2022, the company posted a revenue of Rs 78 crore, up from Rs 48 crore in the previous fiscal. Venkatesh said that the company was profitable in FY22, without sharing the exact earnings. In FY23, Lentra is aiming for a revenue of Rs 180 crore. Prior to this round, the company had raised more than $11 million from BVP, SIG and HDFC Bank in 2019. In June 2022, Lentra acquired Chennai and Singapore-based AI company TheDataTeam for an undisclosed amount to help banks and financial institutions make better data-driven decisions on customers' loan repayment history.Share article on",https://www.vccircle.com//lentraraises-60-million-in-series-b-round,Finance,"It will be operational in Indonesia, the Philippines, and Vietnam by the beginning of next quarter and in two more economies going forward.In the financial year 2022, the company posted a revenue of Rs 78 crore, up from Rs 48 crore in the previous fiscal.",[],"['$60 million', '$400 million', 'more than 13 billion', '$21 billion', 'more than $11 million']"

SoftBank returns to quarterly profit but unveils more Vision Fund pain,11 November,"Japan's SoftBank Group Corp reported its first quarterly profit in three quarters, buoyed by the sale of some of its stake in China's Alibaba even as its massive Vision Fund posted another heavy quarterly loss.The sprawling Vision Fund, which upended the world of technology with its big bets on startups, will also write down its investments in troubled crypto exchange FTX to zero, a source close to SoftBank said, adding that those were less than $100 million.The complications at FTX mark the latest difficulty for Vision Fund, which has been hammered in recent quarters by a global tech rout, prompting SoftBank Chief Executive Masayoshi Son to sharply scale back fresh investments.Investment losses at flagship unit Vision Fund were 1.38 trillion yen ($9.75 billion) in the three months to September 30 as the value of its portfolio continued to slide.Son told a briefing that this would be the last time he would speak at post-earnings briefing for the ""foreseeable future"", adding that he had no health issues.

Cult.fit's FY22 loss marginally higher; topline rises 34%,11 November,"Tata Digital-backed Cult.fit’s reported a loss of Rs 681 crore for FY22, compared to Rs 671 crore in the previous fiscal.  The health and wellness platform operated by CureFit Healthcare Pvt. Ltd posted a 34% growth in revenue to Rs 215.7 crore from Rs 161.4 crore in FY21, as per its annual financial statement filed with the Registrar of Companies. While Cult.fit saw a revenue gain in the last fiscal, it is yet to match its performance in FY20, in which it posted a revenue of about Rs 496 crore. The company, which primarily operates fitness centres, has been battered by the pandemic since the last two fiscals. “In the first three months of FY22, fitness centres were completely shut. However, we had costs of keeping the centres and employees. While gyms reopened in July, they were not allowed to run at 50% capacity. As a result, revenues did not rebound to the full potential,” Naresh Krishnaswamy, business head, Cult.fit, told VCCircle. “We have significantly grown over FY20, and are much bigger than what we were pre-pandemic. The fitness business and the fitness products business are driving the growth for the company. These businesses combined will help us to be operationally profitable in FY24,” Krishnaswamy said. Cult.fit became a unicorn in November last year after the company raised $50 million in cash from Zomato Ltd at a valuation of $1.5 billion. In 2020, the company raised Rs 832 crore in a funding round led by the Singapore government backed Temasek and other investors such as GableHorn Investments and Ascent Capital. In the financial year under review, the company acquired a majority stake in F2 Fun & Fitness to become the master franchise partner for Gold’s Gym in India. At that time, Gold's Gym was the second-largest fitness chain in India operating over 140 centres in 90 plus cities.Prior to this, the company acquired multiple fitness firms, including sports discovery platform Fitso, gym aggregator Fitternity, San Francisco-based fitness company Onyx, and Bengaluru-based a1000yoga and integrated mental wellness platform Seraniti.Founded in 2016 by Mukesh Bansal and Ankit Nagori, Cult.fit also provides healthcare services via Care.fit as well as the mental wellness unit Mind.fit. It also sells healthy food, fitness products, and branded merchandise.  Cult.fit hived off its food business Eat.fit as Curefoods in October 2020, with Nagori heading the new venture. Nagori had swapped his equity in Cure Fit for larger ownership in CureFoods. In FY22, the Bengaluru-headquartered company saw its expense grow one-third to nearly Rs 1000 crore from Rs 756 crore in the last fiscal. Employee benefits expense contributed about 30% of the overall cost at Rs 292 crore in FY22, up from Rs 211 crore in the year-ago period. In FY22, the company spent close to Rs 89 crore on marketing while its cost for purchasing raw materials stood at Rs 37 crore. It also spent Rs 88.4 crore on finished goods in FY22. Finance costs and legal professional charges stood at Rs 72 crore and Rs 86 crore, respectively, in the last financial year.

Average monthly transacting users increased to 17.5 million from 15.5 million in the same period last fiscal.Zomato’s food delivery business turned adjusted Ebitda positive for the first time in the September quarter. “On the profitability front, contribution margin as a percentage of gross order value improved meaningfully from 2.8% in Q1 FY23 to 4.5% in Q2FY23. As a result, the food delivery adjusted Ebitda hit break-even in Q2FY23,” Goyal said.“The increase in contribution margin is driven by improvements on both cost and revenue side…This has been the result of scale and heightened focus on profitability over the last few quarters,” he added.However, the average number of active restaurant partners dropped marginally to 207,000 from 208,000 in the June quarter. In the year-ago September quarter, the number stood at 170,000.Zomato’s business-to-business (B2B) supplies vertical Hyperpure tripled its adjusted revenue to ₹334 crore in the quarter.

Unlike others in the K-12 space who would have started multiple initiatives, ours was a part of the strategy to become the most integrated higher education company in the world,” upGrad said. While the company is now operating in a blended online-offline space, it said over 85% of its revenues will come from the online business. As it goes through the process of consolidating the companies it acquired into one entity by June 2023, the company expects to improve its operating efficiency. “This will help in creating a stronger pipeline of career development opportunities for reducing our overall customer and marketing acquisition costs, significantly,” the company said in the report.It further added it does not have concerns or issues with profitability, considering its current revenue growth rate and margins. In a performance report the firm filed with the MCA, the company said it aims to achieve profitability in ""long business run"".Share article on",https://www.vccircle.com//upgradwidens-losses-over-rising-costs,Finance,"Upskilling edtech unicorn upGrad widened its losses nearly three times to Rs 626.6 crore in the financial year (FY) ended March 2022, compared to Rs 211.1 crore in the previous year.The company raised $210 million in a funding round in August, led by ETS Global and Bodhi Tree, pegging its valuation at $2.25 billion.Losses at the unicorn spiralled due to a significant rise in expenses during FY22.Total expenses grew 2.5x to Rs 1,300.6 crore versus Rs 513.8 crore in FY21.The biggest expense for the edtech was advertising and promotion, for which the company spent Rs 424 crore in FY22, more than double of Rs 205.1 crore it spent in FY21.",[],"['$210 million', '$2.25 billion']"

KKR to invest $400 mn in Anil Agarwal-promoted Serentica Renewables,08 November,"Global private equity giant KKR has agreed to invest $400 million (around Rs 3,300 crore) in Serentica Renewables, a decarbonization platform that seeks to enable energy transition by providing clean energy solutions. KKR makes its investment from its Asia Pacific Infrastructure strategy. The transaction in Serentica marks KKR’s latest investment in India and the renewables sector, both the companies said in a statement. Established in 2022, Serentica Renewables is 100% held by Twinstar Overseas Ltd, which is owned by Indian businessman Anil Agarwal’s Volcan Investments Cyprus Ltd. Agarwal's Twinstar Overseas Ltd also owns controlling stakes in Sterlite Power Transmission Ltd and Sterlite Technologies Ltd.Gurugram-based Serentica is focused on industrial decarbonization, by making renewables the primary source of energy for the commercial & industrial segment which consumes more than 50% of the electricity generated in India. Serentica aims to provide assured renewable energy through a combination of solar, wind, energy storage and balancing solutions.KKR’s most recent investment in the renewable space was $450 million (around Rs 3,585 crore) in Hero Future Energies (HFE), the renewable energy arm of the Hero Group. “Our investment in Serentica reflects KKR’s confidence in India’s renewables sector and our commitment to advancing the energy transition in India. Energy-intensive, heavy-industry companies play an important role in society but have traditionally faced more challenges in meeting energy needs sustainably. With Serentica, we look to support these companies in their decarbonization objectives,” said Hardik Shah, partner at KKR. Standard Chartered Bank acted as the sole financial adviser to Serentica for this transaction. Serentica recently launched Renewable Energy Platform in India to deliver round-the-clock clean energy solutions for large-scale, energy-intensive industrial customers. This includes providing renewable energy solutions through long-term power purchase agreements (PPAs) and working closely with customers to design their paths to net-zero electricity, the statement added. Currently, the company has entered into three long-term PPAs and is in the process of developing over 1,500 MW of solar and wind power projects across various states including Karnataka, Rajasthan, and Maharashtra.“This investment will allow us to leap ahead in our vision of decarbonizing large energy intensive industries and help in reversing climate change. This transaction is amongst the largest industrial decarbonization investments in India to date and carries forward the global decarbonization agenda which is centre stage at COP27 (2022 United Nations Climate Change Conference),” said Pratik Agarwal, director of Serentica Renewables. Serentica’s medium term goal is to install 5,000 MW of carbon-free generation capacity coupled with different storage technologies and supply over 16 billion units of clean energy annually and displace 20 million tonnes of CO2 emissions. The renewable firm is hopeful that the rise in energy demands alongside India’s developmental needs and prosperity, holds significant potential for renewable energy to play an important role in meeting the energy needs of the industrial sector in a sustainable manner.In Asia Pacific, KKR sees renewables as core to its infrastructure strategy and seeks to invest behind the significant opportunities across the region. In 2020, it had set up Virescent Infrastructure, a renewable energy platform to own and operate renewable assets in India.This year, KKR launched Aster Renewable Energy, a renewables platform to develop, build and operate solar, wind, and energy storage projects in Taiwan and Vietnam, with a view to expand to other markets across the region.KKR sponsors investment funds that invest in private equity, credit and real assets and has strategic partners that manage hedge funds.The private equity investor has committed over $25 billion in equity globally to climate and environmental sustainability investments as on 31 December, 2021. Last month, it agreed to buy digital solutions provider Ness Digital Engineering from The Rohatyn Group (TRG).

"Rivaara Labs snags funding from Amicus, Kotak",07 November,"Rivaara Labs Pvt. Ltd, a development-focused molecular diagnostics company, on Monday announced raising Rs 60 crore ($7.3 million) in its first institutional round, a person aware of the development told VCCircle requesting anonymity.The Rs 60 crore funding was led by Amicus Capital and Kotak Investment Advisors Limited (KIAL). Rivaara’s founder Bharat Daftary also invested in the round. The company plans to use the proceeds to accelerate development and commercialization of proprietary test kits, upgrade the manufacturing facilities, expand its lab network and scale up the scientific sales force as well as technical talent across the country.Rivaara is a vertically integrated molecular diagnostic company founded in 2019 by Daftary, who is also the erstwhile promoter of Bharat Serums & Vaccines Limited. Rivaara has developed PCR (polymerase chain reaction)-based test kits in collaboration with European research labs. The research company claims that the tests are specifically developed for detecting pathogens prevalent in India and therefore will lead to early and effective treatments to save lives. Dhiraj Rajendran, executive director, Kotak Investment Advisors, noted that advances in molecular diagnostics over the last few years have opened up possibilities for faster and more accurate ways to detect pathogens at affordable price points. “Adoption of some of these advances such as RT-PCR tests was witnessed during the response to the Covid-19 pandemic.” The tests will also reduce the misuse of antibiotics which has led to the growing problem of antibiotic-resistant strains, the company said in a release. It will provide tests for areas such as respiratory diseases, sepsis, TB (tuberculosis), anti-microbial resistance, etc., and will initially be made available via its own molecular diagnostic lab network. “The vision for Rivaara is to positively impact patient care by addressing gaps in widespread adoption of molecular diagnostics through a scientific sales force to create the right awareness, presence of local labs for faster processing of samples and international quality kits at affordable prices. Amicus and Kotak have an in-depth understanding of the healthcare sector and are aligned with our vision,” said Daftary. The Mumbai-headquartered company plans to expand its network from the existing 12 labs to around 60 labs across India in a bid to lessen the turnaround time for its patients. It also aims to provide the kits to other diagnostics players, with aspirations to tap international markets.Share article on",https://www.vccircle.com//rivaaralabs-snags-funding-from-amicus-kotak,Finance,"The company plans to use the proceeds to accelerate development and commercialization of proprietary test kits, upgrade the manufacturing facilities, expand its lab network and scale up the scientific sales force as well as technical talent across the country.Rivaara is a vertically integrated molecular diagnostic company founded in 2019 by Daftary, who is also the erstwhile promoter of Bharat Serums & Vaccines Limited.“Adoption of some of these advances such as RT-PCR tests was witnessed during the response to the Covid-19 pandemic.” The tests will also reduce the misuse of antibiotics which has led to the growing problem of antibiotic-resistant strains, the company said in a release.","['Bharat Serums & Vaccines Limited', 'RT-PCR']",['$7.3 million']

Mamaearth's parent firm remains profitable for second straight year,03 November,"Honasa Consumer Pvt. Ltd - which retails products under Mamaearth and The Derma Co brands - stayed profitable in financial year 2022 with revenue nearing the Rs 1000 crore mark. The company reported a net profit of Rs 19.8 crore in FY22, a 19.5% drop from Rs 24.6 crore reported in FY21, according to data obtained from business intelligence platform Tofler. It's operating revenue more than doubled to Rs 943 crore in FY22 against Rs 460 crore in the previous fiscal. The company earned Rs 932 crore from sale of products while it made Rs 11.5 crore from sale of services.However, it is important to note that Honasa Consumer made a few changes to its financials for FY21, which are visible in the latest FY22 filing. The company posted an expense of Rs 1,361.2 crore for FY21 due to change in fair valuation of preference shares, which is a non-cash expense.   The cost is an exceptional item (one-time expense) added into the P&L (profit and loss) statement because of a shareholders agreement’s clause which says that if the company cannot provide an exit to the investors, it will need to provide a buyout. So, when a company follows Indian Accounting Standard (Ind-As) rules, it is required to include the provision as an expense in the statement. Honasa Consumer has a portfolio of close to 140 products under the Mamaearth brand, and more than 40 items under The Derma Co.

What Fed's 75 bps hike could spell for Indian equity,03 November,"Markets were lower on Thursday, tracking a slide in Asian peers after US Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell overnight said that the US central bank would raise interest rates more than previously anticipated, sapping the risk appetite. The Fed raised rates 75 basis points for the fourth time in a row, bringing the top of its target range to 4%, the highest level since 2008. Overnight the US market also fell sharply after rising briefly after the Fed policy announcement where it signalled smaller rate increases ahead and noting that monetary policy acted with a lag. The markets took this as a dovish hint. But Chair Jerome Powell soured the mood by saying it was ""very premature"" to think about pausing and that the peak for rates would likely be higher than previously expected.""The double-sided message keeps open the possibility the Fed may raise rates in smaller increments in the future, ending its sequence of three-quarters-of-a-percentage-point hikes as soon as December in favor of more tempered increases of perhaps half a percentage point, while also leaving policymakers room to continue pushing rates higher if inflation doesn't start to come down,"" said Anand Varadarajan, director, Asit C Mehta Financial Services Ltd.The Sensex was trading moderately lower around 60,820, paring initial losses while Nifty held 18,050 levels, in mid-day trade.“The Fed commentary after the expected 75bp rate hike, particularly Jay Powell’s remark that the terminal rate is likely to be higher than thought earlier, disappointed markets which resulted in a selloff in US markets. But it is important to note that when asked about moderating rate hikes he said, “that time is coming and it may come as soon as the next meeting or the one after that."" So, it is possible that the markets can again bounce back since the economy continues to be strong and unemployment is at record lows indicating that a US recession is not imminent,"" said V K Vijayakumar,chief investment strategist at Geojit Financial Services.“India’s outperformance is likely to continue since leading indicators like credit growth, capital expenditure and auto sales point to robust economic recovery,"" he added. Institutional buying could also support Indian markets. “FPI buying of ₹12610 crores during the last 5 trading sessions can provide support to the market at lower levels. Large-cap banks, capital goods and the premium auto segment can be bought on declines,"" Vijayakumar of Geojit Financial Services said. Girish Sodani, Head Equity Market at Swastika Investmart, said that the RBI is also expected to hike interest rates at its December meet but its impact could be also limited on stocks. “RBI is also going for rate hike but we seem impact on very shorter term, Market still stand on stronger phase and need to focus on stock specifics,"" he added. Anand James, chief market strategist at Geojit Financial Services, said some distribution pattern was seen in Wednesday's trade at 18070/50 levels for Nifty. Nifty has support at 17960/17900 zone while next support levels stand 17760/17720.On the Rupee The rupee today edged lower to 82.85 against the US dollar as compared to previous close of 82.80. “On the domestic front, the overnight global rout in financial markets is likely to haunt the rupee. So far its trading tad bit stronger from its all time low, helped by resumption in the FII inflows which brought about 11000 crores in merely two sessions of Nov, as the sentiments accross had improved. Well, the continuation of the same will depend on how RBI holds on to policy amid aggressive Fed. Today RBI will have its unscheduled MPC meeting, which is majorly expected to be a non-event and RBI Governor Das said a letter that will be sent to the government will not be made public after the Nov 3 special meeting because the bank does not have the authority to release it,"" said Amit Pabari, MD of CR Forex Advisors.“Today we could see the RBI could intervene in the spot market to control volatility. Overall, we expect the USD-INR pair to trade higher in a range of 82.00 to 83.20 levels and a breakout on either side will determine further course,"" he added. Share article on",https://www.vccircle.com//whatfed-s-75-bps-hike-could-spell-for-indian-equity,Finance,"""The double-sided message keeps open the possibility the Fed may raise rates in smaller increments in the future, ending its sequence of three-quarters-of-a-percentage-point hikes as soon as December in favor of more tempered increases of perhaps half a percentage point, while also leaving policymakers room to continue pushing rates higher if inflation doesn't start to come down,"" said Anand Varadarajan, director, Asit C Mehta Financial Services Ltd.The Sensex was trading moderately lower around 60,820, paring initial losses while Nifty held 18,050 levels, in mid-day trade.“The Fed commentary after the expected 75bp rate hike, particularly Jay Powell’s remark that the terminal rate is likely to be higher than thought earlier, disappointed markets which resulted in a selloff in US markets.Today RBI will have its unscheduled MPC meeting, which is majorly expected to be a non-event and RBI Governor Das said a letter that will be sent to the government will not be made public after the Nov 3 special meeting because the bank does not have the authority to release it,"" said Amit Pabari, MD of CR Forex Advisors.“Today we could see the RBI could intervene in the spot market to control volatility.","['Fed', 'Asit C Mehta Financial Services Ltd.', 'Sensex', 'Nifty', 'Fed', 'RBI', 'MPC', 'RBI', 'Das', 'CR Forex Advisors', 'RBI']",[]
8i ventures marks the first close of its Fund II,03 November,"Early-stage venture capital (VC) firm 8i ventures on Thursday said it is marking the first close of its second fund with a targeted corpus of $50 million, a top executive told VCCircle.The VC firm expects to mark the final close by March 2023, which it is reserving majorly for institutional investors, co-founder Vikram Chachra said in an interaction. The firm has raised $25 million in its first close, largely anchored by high networth individuals (HNIs) and family offices like Salgaocars and Kothari (DSP), who had also invested in the first fund. The early-stage VC firm had launched its second fund in December last year. 8i ventures, founded in 2019 by Chachra and Vishwanath V, has companies like fintech unicorn Slice, M2P Fintech, Blue Tokai in its portfolio. Through the fund, 8i ventures will invest in business-to-business fintech entities and e-commerce enablers. It will sign average cheques of $1.5-2 million, mostly in early stages. However, this could go up to $10 million across subsequent rounds, the company said. “We believe fintech is the single largest venture opportunity in India. Our key insight when we launched Fund I, was that consumer payments and commerce are a trillion-dollar opportunity. With Fund II, we have an added focus on B2B fintech and commerce - which we believe to be the next trillion-dollar market in India,” Chachra said. The firm is looking to make about 15-20 investments with the current fund, about 5-6 every year. So far, it has closed one investment from this fund, and two more are in the pipeline. “We are actively investing. We are not seeing competition in the deals that we do. We see this as a great environment for seed investing,” said Chachra. The firm had launched its first fund in 2019, which had a total corpus of $15.5 million. It is up 270% with a 100% internal rate of return (IRR) in 3 years. It has already returned 27% of its capital back to investors.“We wrote the first cheque into several outliers that at inception, were unobvious winners. That’s because we partnered with founders targeting under-served categories, ignored by incumbents/industry players. Collectively, our Fund I portfolio winners already process $18 billion of payments annually, while generating $100 million in gross profits, between them,” said Vishwanath V, general partner, 8i Ventures.Earlier this year, the company had partially exited from M2P Solutions Pvt Ltd (M2P) with a 36x multiple over 2 years.

The Walmart-owned company, however, saw its net loss widen 51% to Rs 4,362 crore during the fiscal on the back of rising transportation, marketing and legal charges.Flipkart’s operating revenue soared to Rs 10,477 crore in FY22 against Rs 7,804 crore in FY22, according to the data accessed by business intelligence platform Tofler. In comparison, Flipkart’s key rival Amazon India posted a 32.5% annual growth in its revenue to Rs 21,462 crore for its marketplace vertical, Amazon Seller Services. The company also narrowed its losses by 23% to Rs 3,649 crore in FY22. Also, Flipkart Group’s fashion-focused marketplace Myntra saw its operating revenue increase by 45% to Rs 3501.2 crore in FY22. The firm reported a loss of Rs 597.6 crore, widening from Rs 429 crore in the year before. Flipkart’s revenue is primarily generated from the e-commerce marketplace, advertisement services, collection services and related support services including corporate agent services for insurance companies.Flipkart earned Rs 3,848.2 crore and Rs 2,083.5 crore from logistics and advertising services, respectively. Collections from the marketplace services remained flat at Rs 2,823 crore against Rs 2,794.6 crore in FY21. In comparison, Amazon made Rs 18,703 crore from its marketplace services. Revenue from collection services, which includes payment gateway and cash collection charges, stood at Rs 1.178.3 crore, up from Rs 8,360 crore in the previous fiscal. The total expense of the marketplace arm of Flipkart for the fiscal was reported as Rs 15,020 crore against Rs 10,996 crore in the previous fiscal. The company’s operating loss or Ebitda (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) loss jumped to Rs 3,925 crore, up from Rs 2,267 crore in FY21.In FY22, Flipkart forayed into video streaming, distribution and hosting services by developing original content or using the content of other service providers. The company also ran advertising, promotional activities and loyalty programs, which added to the expenses. Flipkart is currently considering raising $2-3 billion at a valuation of more than $40 billion to expand its product range in India and challenge rivals, Mint reported on Wednesday. The company last raised around $3.6 billion in July 2021, and has deployed most of the capital, with only $700-800 million left, the report said.

Transportation costs swelled to Rs 5,045 crore from Rs 3,444 crore in FY21.

With consumer demand back and SMEs looking to grow their businesses, demand is not a challenge for us. And with automation of our business, we aim to grow faster and plan to double from March this year to Rs 2,400-2,500 crore by March end 2023. We have moved from traditional underwriting to fully automated AI/ML based underwriting and decision making across branches. This has helped us reduce our turnaround time (TAT) from around 5 - 8 days five years ago to now 28-48 hours,” Shah added. Established in 1948 as CDC, which was rebranded as British International Investment beginning April 2022, the investment company has an existing portfolio of over $2 billion in India. Globally, in the last five years it has invested close to £7 billion (around Rs 69,620 crore).   Last year, BII announced the intention to invest up to $1 billion in climate funding in India over the next five years. Over the last four years, CDC has invested over $1 billion in climate finance across Africa and South Asia.   “BII seeks to invest in companies that demonstrate strong development impact capacity and offer tech-enabled innovative solutions with high potential for scalability and Kinara Capital meets these criteria…,” said Manav Bansal, Managing Director and Head of India, BII. Kinara, founded by Shah more than a decade ago, is a non-banking financial company (NBFC) operated by Visage Holdings and Finance Pvt. Ltd. It has 125 branches with presence in six states and plans to enter one more state either Madhya Pradesh or Rajasthan in the coming year.  Shah further said that Kinara had reported profit at Rs 14 crore for March this year and expects this to grow 2.5-3 times by March 2023.In October last year, Kinara Capital had raised debt financing Rs 70 crore from Invest in Visions GmbH (IIV).Kinara Capital’s other equity investors include Gaja Capital, GAWA Capital, Michael & Susan Dell Foundation and Patamar Capital. Share article on",https://www.vccircle.com//britishinternational-investment-leads-rs-200-cr-round-in-kinara-capital,Finance,"This takes the Bengaluru-based fintech firm’s total equity fundraise to $90 million since inception in 2011, Hardika Shah, Founder and CEO at Kinara Capital, told VCCircle.In April this year, the MSME-focused lender had last raised an equity round of Rs 380 crore (around $50 million) from two new global investors led by Nuveen Global Impact Fund, along with Dutch investor Triple Jump.“We have already crossed Rs 1,700 crore AUM as on September.Shah further said that Kinara had reported profit at Rs 14 crore for March this year and expects this to grow 2.5-3 times by March 2023.In October last year, Kinara Capital had raised debt financing Rs 70 crore from Invest in Visions GmbH (IIV).Kinara Capital’s other equity investors include Gaja Capital, GAWA Capital, Michael & Susan Dell Foundation and Patamar Capital.","['Kinara Capital', 'VCCircle', 'Nuveen Global Impact Fund', 'AUM', 'Kinara Capital', 'Invest', 'IIV).Kinara Capital’s', 'Gaja Capital', 'GAWA Capital', 'Michael & Susan Dell Foundation', 'Patamar Capital']","['around $25 million', '$90 million', 'around $50 million', 'over $2 billion', 'close to £7 billion', 'up to $1 billion', 'over $1 billion']"
Byju's secures Rs 300 cr loan from Aakash,27 October,"Think and Learn Pvt. Ltd, which runs edtech unicorn Byju’s, has raised Rs 300 crore via a collateral-free loan from its wholly-owned subsidiary Aakash Educational Services at a time when the company is restructuring its operations to attain group-level profitability by March 2023. Byju’s said in a statement that the Rs 300 crore loan from Aakash Educational Services is in effect an advance against the marketing activities and campaigns the edtech unicorn has been running for Aakash.  “In order to benefit from the economies of scale, Byju’s buys media spots in bulk for all its group companies. This is a strategy that has yielded really positive results for both the group and Aakash…..it is only for principal business activities that a subsidiary and the parent company can give or receive loans. In this case, the principal business activity is marketing for the core business of Byju’s Aakash on which the group has already spent and is now being reimbursed,” the company said in its statement.  However, Byju’s didn’t clarify why the company took a loan, instead of receiving a direct payment for facilitating the ‘marketing activities and campaigns’ for the offline coaching centre chain.  Byju’s acquired Aakash in a cash-and-stock deal for close to $1 billion in April last year. The deal stands as one of the biggest acquisitions by the company so far.  Online news portal The Morning Context reported the development first. Byju’s received the unsecured loan from Aakash a few weeks after it announced raising $250 million in a rights issue from its existing investors, including Qatar Investment Authority (QIA).  The loan from the subsidiary also comes at a time when Byju’s is streamlining its operations, shifting its focus from on-ground sales to inside sales to have more efficient and effective consumer-centric lead conversions.   The firm is taking several measures, including laying off 2500 employees or 5% of its workforce as part of cost-cutting measures. The layoffs are planned across the sales, content, media, and technology divisions.  Other plans include integrating the companies it acquired over the past three years, reworking its sales machinery and hiring a total of 10,000 more teachers in the coming year.  Byju’s has already completed the integration Toppr, Meritnation, TutorVista, Scholar and HashLearn into its core K-10 business. Aakash and Great Learning will continue to function as separate organizations. The Tiger Global-backed company is also retargeting its marketing budget towards its overseas markets  The company had said that the cost reductions will improve unit economics and provide the groundwork for its initial public offering (IPO).Share article on",https://www.vccircle.com//byjus-secures-rs-300-cr-loan-from-aakash,Finance,"Byju’s said in a statement that the Rs 300 crore loan from Aakash Educational Services is in effect an advance against the marketing activities and campaigns the edtech unicorn has been running for Aakash.In this case, the principal business activity is marketing for the core business of Byju’s Aakash on which the group has already spent and is now being reimbursed,” the company said in its statement.","['Byju’s', 'Aakash Educational Services', 'edtech', 'Aakash', 'Byju’s Aakash']","['close to $1 billion', '$250 million']"

Ruparel said the fund is looking at larger cheque sizes as a long list of captive investors may not be “the best use of management time,” thus, focusing on a similar number of investee companies as Fund I, however, with a larger quantum of investment. According to IAN’s Srivastava, Alpha Fund will focus on founders proposing to solve “real problems” relevant to the Indian market, however, remaining sector-agnostic.  This will include sectors across but not limited to cleantech, healthtech, agritech, edutech, fintech, and emerging sectors.The Alpha Fund is aligned with IAN’s plans to invest in 500 startups with a Rs 5000-crore corpus, and will be aimed at creating nearly 50,000 jobs. The fund will also focus on governance and compliance by startup founders, with IAN’s Sunil Munjal, Kris Gopalakrishnan and CP Gurnani spearheading the agenda.The IAN Fund I, launched in 2017, invested in about 72 companies. While the fund’s investments have been completed, it is yet to exit from all the firms, Srivastava said. “The exits are still happening. 67% of the capital deployed has seen value creation with next rounds happening,” Ruparel said. The first fund’s internal rate of return is roughly at 50%, she said, adding the investment has leveraged about Rs 2,800 crores.  Some of IAN’s portfolio investments include Coolberg, FarmersFZ, SmartVizX, Druva Software, Uniphore, among others.Share article on",https://www.vccircle.com//ianlaunches-second-early-stage-fund-with-a-rs-1000-crore-corpus,Finance,"Early stage investing platform Indian Angel Network (IAN) on Thursday launched its second fund, IAN Alpha Fund, with a fund corpus of Rs 1000 (about $120 million) crore, more than double the size of its first fund of Rs 375 crore  that it closed in 2019.With the cheque sizes earmarked for their investee companies, Ruparel said IAN’s Alpha Fund expects investments in about 100 companies– about 70 companies in the first bucket, and about 25 to 30 in the other two.","['IAN', 'IAN Alpha Fund', 'Ruparel', 'IAN', 'Alpha Fund']","['about $120 million', 'about $78 million', 'about $42 million', '$0.14 million', '$1- 5 million']"

The issue was oversubscribed by subscribed 1.63 times. It is listed on National Stock Exchange with a premium of 2% with a price of Rs 495.2.  The company’s shares have since fallen 11.8% since then. It said it remains watchful of the market sentiment.  Other tech stocks- including Paytm, Zomato, Nykaa, PB Fintech–which went public last year, have also had a tough week so far on the stock market. The shares of most of these companies have fallen even as benchmark indices Nifty and Sensex gained. While shares of Paytm, Zomato and PB Fintech have already fallen below issue price, Nykaa is trading dangerously closer to the issue price.  The share price of FSN E-Commerce Ventures Ltd., which operates beauty and fashion marketplace Nykaa, hit the lowest point of Rs 1130.85 since it started trading in November. Its shares traded slightly higher than the issue price of Rs 1,125, ahead of the November 10 expiry of the one-year lock-in period for its pre-IPO shareholders.  However, on Thursday the stock moved up by 0.85% to end the day at Rs 1,162.10 a piece, offering a sigh of relief to investors.  Overall, Nykaa’s stock price has fallen by more than 36% in the last six months, and 4.8% in the last five days of trading. The stock is down 54.8% from its all-time high of Rs 2,573.70.  Nykaa made a strong market debut last year in October when the company’s stock was listed with a 79% premium on the issue price at Rs. 2,001 per share on the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE).  For the first quarter of financial year 2023, Nykaa reported a net profit of Rs 4.5 crore, up 32.4% over the corresponding period last year. On the other hand, the company’s revenue grew 40.6% year-on-year to Rs 1,148.4 crore.  “...we believe success will not be easy as Nykaa is not the cheapest place for beauty and personal care products and neither does Nykaa solve authenticity issue here,” ICICI Securities had said in its August 2022 note.  It also put “chasing growth at elevated levels can be dilutive of gross margin and success in fashion business can be difficult given higher competition in the category,” as potential risks.  Share article on",https://www.vccircle.com//delhiveryshares-plunge-below-ipo-issue-price,Finance,"The company’s stock price breached its initial public offering (IPO) issue price of Rs 487 per share for the second time since the Gurugram-based startup debuted on the stock exchange.Its shares traded slightly higher than the issue price of Rs 1,125, ahead of the November 10 expiry of the one-year lock-in period for its pre-IPO shareholders.","['IPO', 'Gurugram', 'IPO']",[]

MS Dhoni picks up stake in plant protein startup,11 October,"Liberate Foods Pvt. Ltd, which runs plant protein startup Shaka Harry, on Tuesday announced that former former cricketer Mahendra Singh Dhoni has invested an undisclosed amount in the company. The investment comes on the back of Shaka Harry, in July, raising $2 million in its seed funding round led by Better Bite Ventures, Blue Horizon and Panthera Peak Ventures. Dexler Holdings, celebrity Chef Manu Chandra and a group of domestic family offices and angel investors also participated in the round. Founded by Anand Nagarajan, Sandeep Devgan, Hemalatha Srinivasan, Ruth Renita and Anoop Haridasan, Shaka Harry is a plant-based meat brand retailing a slew of meal and snack products. The startup says that its products are curated around Indian cuisine and palate. “We are serving over 30,000 customers across 10 cities monthly and expect to triple this number in the next few months. Shaka Harry will also be available on global shelves by the end of this year,” said Anand Nagarajan, co-founder and chief executive of Liberate Foods. Shaka Harry retails its products online via Swiggy Instamart, BigBasket, SPAR and Zepto. The startup has also partnered with supermarts such as Metro and Godrej’s Nature's Basket to sell products offline. The products are available in Mumbai, Delhi, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Chennai, Pune, Ahmedabad and Gurgaon.“For a growing population, current protein sources aren’t sustainably as scalable. We now have a choice to shift to smarter protein alternatives without compromising on taste and texture. The plant protein segment is an exciting consumer space,” said Dhoni. The right investments in talent, R&D, manufacturing and distribution could drive the Indian smart protein sector to a market size of nearly Rs 19,000 crore by 2030, including a sizeable export market, as per GFI research with Deloitte, quoted in the release.  In the recent past, the plant protein segment has seen a lot of backing globally as such diets are claimed to be more sustainable.

Byd to launch first passenger EV in India amid global push,11 October,"Warren Buffet-backed Chinese electric carmaker Byd will launch its first passenger car in India on Tuesday, an electric sport-utility vehicle (SUV), marking its entry into the mainstream market amid a broader global expansion.BYD, which already sells electric buses and electric vehicles (EVs) for corporate fleets in India, will launch its Atto 3 electric SUV in the world's fourth-largest car market where domestic carmaker Tata Motors dominates electric car sales.The move comes amid a wider global push by the Chinese carmaker which has already started selling electric cars and plug-in electric hybrids in markets around the world, including Norway, New Zealand, Singapore, Brazil, Costa Rica and Colombia.Earlier this year, Byd said it would start selling its passenger EVs in Japan from 2023 and also has plans to set up a facility in Thailand - its latest among 30 others in the United States, Brazil and India - to produce 150,000 cars a year from 2024. It launched the Atto 3 electric SUV in Thailand on Monday.Byd's push into India also comes at a time when the South Asian country continues to maintain tight scrutiny of investments coming from bordering nations, including China.Strict controls on such incoming investments forced Chinese carmaker Great Wall Motor to shelve plans to invest $1 billion in India earlier this year, after it failed to obtain regulatory approvals.Byd, however, already has a manufacturing plant in the country and would not need to bring in new investments to assemble and sell the Atto 3, a source familiar with the company's plans said.The Shenzhen-based auto and battery producer, which includes Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway as an investor, entered India in 2007 producing batteries and components for mobile phone makers from its plant near the southern city of Chennai.In 2013 it started building buses in the country with a local Indian partner and in 2021 it launched its e6 EV for sale to corporate fleet operators and owners.Byd has capacity to produce 10,000 units a year at its southern India plant where it will assemble the Atto 3.Share article on",https://www.vccircle.com//bydto-launch-first-passenger-ev-in-india-amid-global-push,Finance,"Warren Buffet-backed Chinese electric carmaker Byd will launch its first passenger car in India on Tuesday, an electric sport-utility vehicle (SUV), marking its entry into the mainstream market amid a broader global expansion.BYD, which already sells electric buses and electric vehicles (EVs) for corporate fleets in India, will launch its Atto 3 electric SUV in the world's fourth-largest car market where domestic carmaker Tata Motors dominates electric car sales.The move comes amid a wider global push by the Chinese carmaker which has already started selling electric cars and plug-in electric hybrids in markets around the world, including Norway, New Zealand, Singapore, Brazil, Costa Rica and Colombia.Earlier this year, Byd said it would start selling its passenger EVs in Japan from 2023 and also has plans to set up a facility in Thailand - its latest among 30 others in the United States, Brazil and India - to produce 150,000 cars a year from 2024.It launched the Atto 3 electric SUV in Thailand on Monday.Byd's push into India also comes at a time when the South Asian country continues to maintain tight scrutiny of investments coming from bordering nations, including China.Strict controls on such incoming investments forced Chinese carmaker Great Wall Motor to shelve plans to invest $1 billion in India earlier this year, after it failed to obtain regulatory approvals.Byd, however, already has a manufacturing plant in the country and would not need to bring in new investments to assemble and sell the Atto 3, a source familiar with the company's plans said.The Shenzhen-based auto and battery producer, which includes Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway as an investor, entered India in 2007 producing batteries and components for mobile phone makers from its plant near the southern city of Chennai.In 2013 it started building buses in the country with a local Indian partner and in 2021 it launched its e6 EV for sale to corporate fleet operators and owners.Byd has capacity to produce 10,000 units a year at its southern India plant where it will assemble the Atto 3.Share article on","['BYD', 'Tata Motors', 'Byd', 'Great Wall Motor', ""Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway"", 'Chennai']",['$1 billion']

Credit guarantee for startups: Should taxpayers be involved? ,11 October,"At first glance, the government’s move to extend collateral-free debt funding of up to ₹10 crore to startups under the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade’s (DPIIT) Credit Guarantee Scheme for Startups appears to be a masterstroke, addressing the biggest challenge faced by start-ups, particularly in the growth and mid-stages of their development, while at the same time ensuring that India continues to retain its leadership position as one of the most vibrant markets for startups in the world, with more than 80,000 registered startups putting it in the third place in global rankings.The scheme, notified last week, is pretty straightforward. The scheme would underwrite – guarantee, in other words – up to 80% of the credit facility up to ₹3 crore, 75% of the credit facility between ₹3 and 5 crore, and 65% of the credit facility between ₹5 and 10 crore extended to startups by banks and non-banking financial corporations (NBFCs).In addition to transaction-based cover for single borrowers, there is also an umbrella cover for a group of eligible borrowers, which will provide a guarantee to venture debt funds registered under alternate investment fund (AIF) regulations of Sebi. “The extent of umbrella-based cover will be the actual losses or up to a maximum of 5% of pooled investment on which cover is being taken from the fund in eligible startups, whichever is lower. It is subject to a maximum of ₹10 crore per borrower,"" DPIIT said in a statement.There is no mention of the corpus which will be used to underwrite these guarantees, although an earlier plan by the DPIIT proposed a corpus of ₹500 crore per year for four years as budgetary support to the National Credit Guarantee Trust Company, which will operate the guarantee scheme.Credit guarantee schemes are of course a well-used tool by governments around the world, particularly to help micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs), which usually face the greatest difficulty in finding funding support, particularly for working capital. Practically, every major economy launched such a scheme in the wake of the Covid pandemic – according to a World Bank Tracker, as many as 57 new credit guarantee schemes were launched in 2020 alone around the world, while many existing ones were tweaked to address the special circumstances of the pandemic.There is also a strong economic rationale for publicly-funded credit guarantee schemes for MSMEs (most startups fall under this bracket), since they account for almost a third of the gross domestic product (GDP) and a bulk of employment (estimated at around 100 million) in India. Typically, such businesses have high growth potential, contribute disproportionately to local economies where they are located and are high employment generators. At the same time, they tend to be highly risky, and are constrained by lack of a prior – or adequate – financial track record given their age and hence either miss out on traditional funding or have to pay much higher interest rates. But, as an OECD study (Financing SMEs and Entrepreneurs 2018) pointed out, the benefits have to be viewed against the costs – not just of operating the scheme, but of the opportunity cost of deploying public funds in this area vis-à-vis the returns if they were deployed in other areas like physical and social infrastructure creation, healthcare, education, etc.This is where using taxpayer monies to fund risky startups becomes problematic. For startups are not traditional MSMEs as we know them. Take the eligibility criteria to be recognized as a startup by the DPIIT, the starting point for the scheme. They include an age criterion (less than 10 years in existence after incorporation), a turnover limit (an annual turnover not exceeding Rs 100 crore for any of the financial years since incorporation), should be an ‘original entity’ and not have been formed by splitting up or reconstructing an already existing business and most importantly, “Should work towards development or improvement of a product, process or service and/or have scalable business model with high potential for creation of wealth & employment.""The trouble is that there are no milestones/measures suggested to measure the actual creation of “wealth and employment"" as far as startups are concerned. It therefore becomes practically impossible to evaluate how well a startup has performed in this context. Without this, it is impossible to estimate the opportunity costs of using public funds to back startups. So far, venture capitalists and funders have taken on the downsides of backing startups  – potential failures and loss of value (Softbank’s Vision Fund alone lost $21.68 billion in value just in the first quarter of the current fiscal) and are therefore justified in taking the upsides (venture funders made over $14.3 billion in exits in 2021 according to Bain).The government’s guarantee scheme, though, leaves the upsides still in private hand while passing on the downside risks to the taxpayers.Share article on",https://www.vccircle.com//creditguarantee-for-startups-should-taxpayers-be-involved-,Finance,"At first glance, the government’s move to extend collateral-free debt funding of up to ₹10 crore to startups under the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade’s (DPIIT) Credit Guarantee Scheme for Startups appears to be a masterstroke, addressing the biggest challenge faced by start-ups, particularly in the growth and mid-stages of their development, while at the same time ensuring that India continues to retain its leadership position as one of the most vibrant markets for startups in the world, with more than 80,000 registered startups putting it in the third place in global rankings.The scheme, notified last week, is pretty straightforward.It is subject to a maximum of ₹10 crore per borrower,"" DPIIT said in a statement.There is no mention of the corpus which will be used to underwrite these guarantees, although an earlier plan by the DPIIT proposed a corpus of ₹500 crore per year for four years as budgetary support to the National Credit Guarantee Trust Company, which will operate the guarantee scheme.Credit guarantee schemes are of course a well-used tool by governments around the world, particularly to help micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs), which usually face the greatest difficulty in finding funding support, particularly for working capital.","['the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade’s', 'DPIIT', 'DPIIT', 'the National Credit Guarantee Trust Company']","['between ₹3 and 5', 'between ₹5', '10', '500', '$21.68 billion', '$14.3 billion']"

Livspace to launch $100 mn ‘house of brands' fund,10 October,"Livspace, an omni-channel home interior and renovation paltform, has allocated $100 million to invest in and incubate brands and content destinations across markets in the home decor, interior, renovation and ancillary segments, said a senior company official.Backed by investors such as KKR, Venturi Partners and Jungle Ventures, the company plans to create its own ‘house of brands’ business and expand it to markets such as India, Singapore, Malaysia and the Middle East, said Anuj Srivastava, co-founder and chief executive, Livspace.The company had acquired a majority stake in Qanvast, a Singapore-based home design platform last December.“Currently, we are looking at deal sizes in the $15-50 million range, and it also varies depending on the final synergies and conversations,” he added.Livspace is looking to invest in content destinations, direct-to-consumer interior brands, private labels and to further  bolster its home space consolidation plans. It will also focus on investing in sectors such as omni-channel retail solutions across logistics, supply chains, merchandising and demand aggregation.According to Srivastava, as the company continues to scale and enter new markets, it is looking for successful business models that will help it scale faster.“We are looking at ideas, technologies and people that bring in additional functional expertise to drive better outcomes for all our stakeholders. In line with this, we plan to invest across all stages in brands’ lifecycle to help them disrupt the industry further,” he added.The fund will be headed by Ankit Shah, chief strategy officer, Livspace.“Today’s disruptive market combined with the macro-economic environment is driving innovation at every level. This has resulted in exploring new pathways by adding technology and capabilities that will drive profitability. This will help our business across all our markets scale faster, grow our margin stack further and create strong defensible moats,” said Shah in a statement.Earlier this year, the company raised a $180 million funding round led by KKR, valuing it $1.2 billion and making it a part of the coveted unicorn club of startups that are valued at $1 billion or more. In all, Livspace has raised around $450 million from investors.Founded in 2014 by Ramakant Sharma and Anuj Srivastava, Livspace claims to have delivered more than 125,000 rooms and is selling over 7.5 million items through its platform.Based in Singapore, Livspace currently has operations in over 45 cities across Southeast Asia, India, and the Gulf region.In the house of brands segment, Livspace is likely to compete with other brand aggregators such as Mensa Brands and Globalbees, the firm backed by FirstCry.On the increasing competition in the space, Srivastava said, “Over the years, we have built a technology platform and a business model that enables us to launch any home-related offering in any geography and then scale it quickly.”“We are on a high growth trajectory, and we have more than doubled our business in the last 12 months. Livspace is building and creating a high growth and sustainable business with strong profitability. We are the largest and fastest growing company in the interiors and renovation industry and are very well funded to achieve our growth and profitability plans. Over the next 18-24 months, we will further expand our footprint - both through geographical expansion and potential inorganic growth,” he added.Share article on",https://www.vccircle.com//livspaceto-launch-100-mn-house-of-brands-fund,Finance,"Livspace, an omni-channel home interior and renovation paltform, has allocated $100 million to invest in and incubate brands and content destinations across markets in the home decor, interior, renovation and ancillary segments, said a senior company official.Backed by investors such as KKR, Venturi Partners and Jungle Ventures, the company plans to create its own ‘house of brands’ business and expand it to markets such as India, Singapore, Malaysia and the Middle East, said Anuj Srivastava, co-founder and chief executive, Livspace.The company had acquired a majority stake in Qanvast, a Singapore-based home design platform last December.“Currently, we are looking at deal sizes in the $15-50 million range, and it also varies depending on the final synergies and conversations,” he added.Livspace is looking to invest in content destinations, direct-to-consumer interior brands, private labels and to further  bolster its home space consolidation plans.In all, Livspace has raised around $450 million from investors.Founded in 2014 by Ramakant Sharma and Anuj Srivastava, Livspace claims to have delivered more than 125,000 rooms and is selling over 7.5 million items through its platform.Based in Singapore, Livspace currently has operations in over 45 cities across Southeast Asia, India, and the Gulf region.In the house of brands segment, Livspace is likely to compete with other brand aggregators such as Mensa Brands and Globalbees, the firm backed by FirstCry.On the increasing competition in the space, Srivastava said, “Over the years, we have built a technology platform and a business model that enables us to launch any home-related offering in any geography and then scale it quickly.”“We are on a high growth trajectory, and we have more than doubled our business in the last 12 months.","['KKR', 'Venturi Partners', 'Jungle Ventures', 'Livspace', 'Qanvast', 'Livspace', 'Livspace', 'Livspace', 'Mensa Brands', 'Globalbees', 'FirstCry', 'Srivastava']","['$100 million', '$15-50 million', '$180 million', '$1.2 billion', '$1 billion', 'around $450 million']"

Grip launches Securitized Debt Instruments offering,07 October,"Alternative investment platform Grip has forayed into securitized debt instrument (SDIs) offerings, which will be launched on the National Stock Exchange (NSE) on Friday.  The offering is the first of its kind by a fintech company in India and also to launch on NSE. Grip is expanding its range of offerings and opening up pathways for individual investors to invest, chief executive officer Nikhil Aggarwal said in a telephonic interaction with VCCircle.The product is a rated and listed fixed income instrument offering 18% internal rate of return (IRR) to individual investors, Aggarwal noted.  SDIs are a fixed-return investment instrument introduced by SEBI in 2008. Companies, non-banking financial companies (NBFCs), and banks often enter into business transactions in which they earn regular monthly income under long-term contracts. This could be interest income for an NBFC or lease rental for a company or subscription rental for a SaaS (Software as a Service) company. An SDI is a mechanism to convert these contracted streams of income into a financial investment. An investor holding an SDI effectively purchases the rights to those future receivables at a discounted rate. This allows them to generate attractive returns with monthly fixed payouts.The SDI offering aims at investors looking to diversify their portfolio and includes companies like Furlenco, Zypp Electric, BigSpoon, and Battery Smart. The minimum investment starts at Rs 10 lakh, Aggarwal said.  The alternative investment product is a Crisil-rated financial instrument and has been executed in-line with the Securities and Exchanges Board of India's (SEBI) regulations.    “The listing of securitized debt on NSE marks a milestone for the debt segment. NSE is committed to the development of the debt market in India. This issuance shall pave the way for the listing of more securitized debt instruments. NSE has been playing a pivotal role in developing the Indian capital markets and has introduced several new products and services such as derivatives, ETFs, SLB, EBP, and REITS/InvITs,” said Ashish Kumar Chauhan, managing director and CEO, NSE.   Grip, founded by Aggarwal, Vivek Gulati and Aashish Jindal in 2020, acts as a link between companies and retail investors to fulfill the capital needs of firms.  Grip raised a total funding amount of $4.8 million and $3 million in a Series A round led by Venture Highway and Endiya Partners in August last year.Share article on",https://www.vccircle.com//griplaunches-securitized-debt-instruments-offering,Finance,"Grip is expanding its range of offerings and opening up pathways for individual investors to invest, chief executive officer Nikhil Aggarwal said in a telephonic interaction with VCCircle.The product is a rated and listed fixed income instrument offering 18% internal rate of return (IRR) to individual investors, Aggarwal noted.NSE has been playing a pivotal role in developing the Indian capital markets and has introduced several new products and services such as derivatives, ETFs, SLB, EBP, and REITS/InvITs,” said Ashish Kumar Chauhan, managing director and CEO, NSE.","['VCCircle', 'IRR', 'Aggarwal', 'NSE', 'SLB', 'EBP', 'NSE']","['$4.8 million', '$3 million']"

Shell-backed Orb Energy raises $20 mn,06 October,"Shell Plc-backed integrated solar energy solutions provider Orb Energy Pvt. Ltd on Thursday, announced raising about $20 million in a follow-on funding round from the US International Development Finance Corporation (DFC). The company has received the first tranche of the loan, amounting $10 million, on Thursday. Orb Energy plans to deploy these funds to strengthen its in-house financing facility for rooftop and ground-mounted solar customers in India.  “DFC’s second loan to Orb Energy will further expand renewable energy use by SMEs across India. With DFC’s loan, Orb Energy's work will create additional jobs and cut energy costs for businesses, boosting economic growth in a sector that is key to India’s development goals,” said Jake Levine, DFC’s chief climate officer. Apart from global energy sector giant Shell, the Bengaluru-based solar energy firm is backed by Bamboo Capital Partners, Rianta Capital, Pamiga Finance SA, and Dutch development bank FMO, which proposed an additional equity investment of €1 million in 2019.  It also raised about Rs 95 crore through a combination of equity and debt investments, in 2018, in a bid to bolster its finance platform. Key investors in the fundraising included FMO and US government agency Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC).  Founded in 2006 by NP Ramesh and Damian Miller, the solar energy firm largely operates in India where it employs about 250 people. Its key international markets include Malaysia, Indonesia, Ghana and Kenya, where it has a subsidiary catering to other African countries. Its portfolio includes solar electricity and water heating solutions, targeting residential, commercial and industrial customers, with a particular focus on small and medium-sized enterprises.

"UPI payments double in June quarter, set new record in September",04 October,"National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI)’s unified payments interface (UPI) accounted for over 83% of all digitally made payments in India as of the June quarter, according to a report by digital payments service provider Worldline, published Tuesday. As per NPCI’s UPI product stats tracker and Worldline, UPI transactions grossed ₹30.4 lakh crore in value in the June quarter, rising 98% year-on-year (YoY).In terms of volume, while 20.6 billion digital payments were made in this period, 84% — or 17.4 billion — of transactions were via UPI.The payment instrument also set a new record at the onset of India’s festive period sales, amounting to ₹11.2 lakh crore in September itself — up by 70.6% YoY. While UPI payments to businesses outpaced transfers between individuals in September by number of transactions, the latter accounted for 77.2% of the total value of these transactions.This makes UPI the primary factor for the growth of digital payments in India, which industry experts and stakeholders say is likely to continue for at least the next decade. Ranadurjay Talukdar, partner and payments advisory leader at consultancy firm EY LLP India, said that digital payments presently account for approximately 25% of all payments, which leaves the payments industry with a large addressable market to cater to.“Add to that UPI’s international projects under the NPCI International Payments Limited (NIPL), and there should not be any threat to UPI adoption slowing down due to market saturation any time soon — at least not in the next eight or 10 years,” Talukdar said.Talukdar added that one of the biggest drivers behind the adoption of UPI is the shortened clearance cycle of payments, which adds to the availability of cash in hand for businesses across the country. While card-based payments required at least one day for payments to be settled and for businesses to have cash in hand, UPI’s near-instant payments clearance cycle has prompted the service’s adoption.The margin of transactions in digital payments have also been a key factor. “Until around 2015, India had about 40 million digital points of sales, which also imposed a 2% fee on card-based digital transactions. For any small business operating at margins of anywhere between 6-8%, they couldn’t afford to pay a quarter of their profit margins simply for transactions,” he said.Since 2015-16, Talukdar said that the points of sale in digital transactions have grown to over 300 million businesses across India, buoyed by payment service providers such as Razorpay, and the adoption of third party, QR-based merchant payment services such as PhonePe, Google Pay and Paytm.Razorpay, for instance, sees UPI account for most of the transactions on its platform. On September 22, Harshil Mathur, chief executive of Razorpay, told Mint that UPI payments account for “more than 65%” of all payments on the platform.To be sure, P2P UPI transactions, which include UPI-based money transfers between two individuals not registered as businesses, still account for most UPI transactions. According to Worldline’s report, 59% of all UPI transactions by volume were between individuals, while the rest were made to merchants. The disparity is even larger when the value of UPI transactions are taken into account — 79.7% of the ₹30.4 lakh crore in UPI transactions were made between individuals.This reflects in the per-transaction ticket size as well. Worldline’s report stated that while individual UPI payments were valued at ₹2,425 per transaction, those made to businesses stood at ₹820 per transaction.Share article on",https://www.vccircle.com//upipayments-double-in-june-quarter-set-new-record-in-september,Finance,"While UPI payments to businesses outpaced transfers between individuals in September by number of transactions, the latter accounted for 77.2% of the total value of these transactions.This makes UPI the primary factor for the growth of digital payments in India, which industry experts and stakeholders say is likely to continue for at least the next decade.Ranadurjay Talukdar, partner and payments advisory leader at consultancy firm EY LLP India, said that digital payments presently account for approximately 25% of all payments, which leaves the payments industry with a large addressable market to cater to.“Add to that UPI’s international projects under the NPCI International Payments Limited (NIPL), and there should not be any threat to UPI adoption slowing down due to market saturation any time soon — at least not in the next eight or 10 years,” Talukdar said.Talukdar added that one of the biggest drivers behind the adoption of UPI is the shortened clearance cycle of payments, which adds to the availability of cash in hand for businesses across the country.","['UPI', 'UPI', 'EY LLP India', 'UPI', 'the NPCI International Payments Limited', 'NIPL', 'UPI', 'Talukdar', 'Talukdar', 'UPI']","['30.4', '11.2', '30.4', '2,425', '820']"

Another 43 companies, who are looking to secure about Rs 70,000 crore, are also awaiting approval from the capital markets regulator, the findings added.   However, IPO activity will be impacted by the volatility in the secondary market, mainly because of recessionary fears and rising interest rates, according to Pranav Haldea, Managing Director, PRIME Database Group.  Between April and September 2022, 14 companies debuted on the stock market, compared to 25 in the corresponding period last year. The average deal size grew to a high of Rs 2,533 crore in the last six months.  “The overall response from the public was moderate,” PRIME Database said in a statement.   Of the 14, four IPOs were oversubscribed by more than 10 times, and three were oversubscribed by more than 3 times. The remaining were oversubscribed between 1-3 times.   While the response from high net-worth individuals' segment (Rs 2-10 lakh) was encouraging, retail investors saw a moderate response.   The average number of applications from retail dropped to 7.57 lakh, in comparison to 15.56 lakh in 2021-22 and 12.49 lakh in 2020-21, the company said.   Life Insurance Corporation of India, which got listed in May in the country’s largest IPO in its history, raised about 58% (or Rs 20,557 crore) of the total capital in the first half.   This was followed by logistics company Delhivery, which raised Rs 5,235 crore, and Rainbow Children's Medicare, which raised Rs 1,581 crore.   “Only 1 out of the 14 IPOs (Delhivery) was from a new age technology company (NATC) pointing towards the slowdown in IPOs from this sector,” the firm said.   In the second half, only 10 of the 114 companies that are expected to debut on the public exchanges in the second half are NATCs. They are looking to raise roughly Rs 35,000 crore.  “IPO is a once in a lifetime event for a company and, as seen several times in the past, companies would prefer to let their approval lapse rather than launching their IPO in a volatile market,” the firm said.  Share article on",https://www.vccircle.com//ipofundraising-drops-by-32-to-rs-35-456-cr-in-first-half-of-fy23,Finance,"Life Insurance Corporation of India, which got listed in May in the country’s largest IPO in its history, raised about 58% (or Rs 20,557 crore) of the total capital in the first half.In the second half, only 10 of the 114 companies that are expected to debut on the public exchanges in the second half are NATCs.","['Life Insurance Corporation of India', 'IPO']",[]

Hawkish Fed may prompt RBI to deliver a 50 bps hike,28 September,"Interest rate hikes in the United States and the resultant pressure on the rupee is likely to give the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) reason to deliver a 50-basis-point rate hike on Friday even as it tries to protect a recovery in growth.The RBI's monetary policy committee (MPC) has already hiked the key policy rate by 140 bps since May to 5.4%. Since the last policy meet, retail inflation has risen above 7% again and the rupee has weakened 9.5% on year, with pressure on the currency accelerating after the U.S. Federal Reserve's meeting last week.""Shifts in the global policy environment have weakened sentiment considerably, which has been negative for currencies, complicating the policymakers' inflation fight,"" said Radhika Rao, senior economist at DBS Bank.""While rate sensitive flows are a small part of overall bond ownership, authorities will be keen to defend against spill over risks from global developments,"" she added.The spread between Indian and U.S. 10-year bond yields touched a low of 360 basis points last week, its lowest since Sept 2009.With the Fed Funds rate seen rising to 4.6% by the end of 2023 according to its dot plot, the gap between the policy rate in the United States and India will also narrow.The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is currently seen pausing rate hikes at 6%, according to the latest RBI poll, but the overnight indexed swaps (OIS) market predicts the rate could rise to 6.5%.This would mean an interest rate differential in the range of 150-200 bps, far lower than the long-term average of 500 bps seen during the 2002 to 2022 period.""Interest differentials also matter and cannot be ignored, particularly when the Fed remains in the midst of an aggressive rate hike cycle,"" Deutsche Bank said in a recent note.""The breach of rupee above 80 levels, despite RBI's proactive FX intervention, opens up room for further depreciation in the coming months. This is likely to be inflationary on the margin and would merit a 50 bps rate hike at this juncture,"" the bank added.ONE-TO-ONE ACTION UNLIKELYWhile the MPC could weigh a bigger rate hike at its September meet, rates in India may not rise as sharply as in developed markets over the current cycle, said Vivek Kumar, senior economist with QuantEco Research.""Interest rate differentials do matter for emerging market economies.

'Bankrupt companies selling in parts better than sale to single bidder',27 September,"A mix of investors buying different parts of a bankrupt company is better than a single investor picking up the company as a whole as different investors may find individual units more strategically fitting, Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (IBBI) has said in an explanation to the rule changes issued earlier this month.As per the changes that are now effective, administrators of bankrupt firms are required to re-invite bids for individual units of the company if there was no bidder for the whole company the first time.IBBI explained in a presentation posted on its website that corporate debtors have functional and non-functional assets in different businesses and locations. Potential investors are interested in functional asset or an asset in one location or business alone. Acquiring the stressed business as a whole may not be in line with the capacity and strategic objective of the potential investor, IBBI explained. Besides, the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Finance too had highlighted the fact that bidders may be interested in select business units or assets rather than the entire business. “A combination of bidders taking different business units or assets may be far superior to one bidder acquiring the entire assets,"" the presentation pointed out.The amendments to the regulations issued earlier this month-- Insolvency Resolution Process for Corporate Persons (Fourth Amendment) Regulations—enabled the re-issue of the request for resolution plan for sale of part of the assets of the corporate debtor as well where no resolution plan has been received for the company as a whole, IBBI explained.The bankruptcy resolution plan may contain measures for sale of part of the assets of the corporate debtor to one or more successful resolution applicants, IBBI said.The amendments also provided for formulating a strategy for marketing of assets of the bankrupt business to a wider and targeted audience of potential bidders.The amendment enabled a longer time for the asset to be in the market as the invitation for expression of interest has been advanced to 60th day from insolvency commencement date. Changes have also been introduced to provide more relevant information to persons for expressing interest.With the aim to reduce delays in the process and to enhance efficiency of available time, the amendment enabled creditors to examine whether they want to explore the option of ‘compromise or arrangement’—a restructure option under the Companies Act--and seek the same from the tribunal while applying for a liquidation order.Share article on",https://www.vccircle.com//bankruptcompanies-selling-in-parts-better-than-sale-to-single-bidder,Finance,"A mix of investors buying different parts of a bankrupt company is better than a single investor picking up the company as a whole as different investors may find individual units more strategically fitting, Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (IBBI) has said in an explanation to the rule changes issued earlier this month.As per the changes that are now effective, administrators of bankrupt firms are required to re-invite bids for individual units of the company if there was no bidder for the whole company the first time.IBBI explained in a presentation posted on its website that corporate debtors have functional and non-functional assets in different businesses and locations.“A combination of bidders taking different business units or assets may be far superior to one bidder acquiring the entire assets,"" the presentation pointed out.The amendments to the regulations issued earlier this month-- Insolvency Resolution Process for Corporate Persons (Fourth Amendment) Regulations—enabled the re-issue of the request for resolution plan for sale of part of the assets of the corporate debtor as well where no resolution plan has been received for the company as a whole, IBBI explained.The bankruptcy resolution plan may contain measures for sale of part of the assets of the corporate debtor to one or more successful resolution applicants, IBBI said.The amendments also provided for formulating a strategy for marketing of assets of the bankrupt business to a wider and targeted audience of potential bidders.The amendment enabled a longer time for the asset to be in the market as the invitation for expression of interest has been advanced to 60th day from insolvency commencement date.","['Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India', 'IBBI', 'month-- Insolvency Resolution Process for Corporate Persons', 'IBBI', 'IBBI']",[]

"Analysis: After feverish week, global investors lick wounds and brace for more chaos",26 September,"Global investors are preparing for more market mayhem after a monumental week that whipsawed asset prices around the world, as central banks and governments ramped up their fight against inflation.Signs of extraordinary times were everywhere. The Federal Reserve delivered its third straight seventy-five basis point rate hike while Japan intervened to shore up the yen for the first time since 1998. The British pound slid to a fresh 37-year trough against the dollar after the country's new finance minister unleashed historic tax cuts and huge increases in borrowing.""It's hard to know what will break where, and when,"" said Mike Kelly, head of multi-asset at PineBridge Investments (US). ""Before, the thinking had been that a recession would be short and shallow. Now we're throwing that away and thinking about the unintended consequences of much tighter monetary policy.""Stocks plunged everywhere. The Dow Jones Industrial Average nearly joined the S&P 500 and Nasdaq in a bear market while bonds tumbled to their lowest level in years as investors recalibrated their portfolios to a world of persistent inflation and rising interest rates.Towering above it all was the U.S. dollar, which has rocketed to its highest level in 20 years against a basket of currencies, lifted in part by investors seeking shelter from the wild swings in markets.""Currency exchange rates ... are now violent in their moves,"" said David Kotok, chairman and chief investment officer at Cumberland Advisors. ""When governments and central banks are in the business of setting the interest rates, they are shifting the volatility to the currency markets.""For now, the selloffs across asset classes have drawn few bargain hunters. In fact, many believe things are bound to get worse as tighter monetary policy across the globe raises the risks of a worldwide recession.""We remain cautious,"" said Russ Koesterich, who oversees the Global Allocation Fund for Blackrock, the world's largest asset manager, noting his allocation to equities is ""well below benchmark"" and he is also cautious on bonds.""I think there's a lot of uncertainty on how quickly inflation will come down, there's a lot of uncertainty about whether or not the Fed will go through with as an aggressive tightening campaign as they signaled this week.""Kotok said he is positioned conservatively with high cash levels. ""I'd like to see enough of a selloff to make entry attractive in the U.S. stock market,"" Kotok said.The fallout from the hectic week exacerbated trends for stocks and bonds that have been in place all year, pushing down prices for both asset classes. But the murky outlook meant that they were still not cheap enough for some investors.""We think the time to go long in equities is still ahead of us until we see signs that the market has bottomed,"" said Jake Jolly, senior investment strategist at BNY Mellon, who has been increasing his allocation to short duration sovereign bonds.""The market is getting closer and closer to pricing in this recession that is widely expected but it is not yet fully priced in.""Goldman Sachs strategists on Friday lowered their year-end target for the benchmark U.S. stock index, the S&P 500, to 3,600 from 4,300. The index was last at 3,693.23.Bond yields, which move inversely to prices, surged across the world. Yields on the benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury hit their highest level in more than 12 years, while Germany's two-year bond yield rose above 2% for the first time since late 2008. In the UK, five-year gilts leapt 50 bps -- their biggest one-day jump since at least late 1991, according to Refinitiv data.""At some point, the fears will shift from inflation to growth,"" said Matthew Nest, global head of active fixed income at State Street Global Advisors, who thinks bond yields have moved so high they are starting to look ""pretty attractive.""Investors fear things will get worse before they get better.""The question is now not whether we are going into a recession, it is how deep will the recession be, and might we have some form of financial crisis and major global liquidity shock,"" said Mike Riddell, a senior fixed income portfolio manager at Allianz Global Investors in London.Because monetary policy tends to work with a lag, Riddell estimates the renewed hawkishness from central banks means the global economy will be even weaker by the middle of next year.""We are of the view that markets are still massively underestimating the global economic growth hit that is coming,"" he said.Share article on",https://www.vccircle.com//analysisafter-feverish-week-global-investors-lick-wounds-and-brace-for-more-chaos,Finance,"The Dow Jones Industrial Average nearly joined the S&P 500 and Nasdaq in a bear market while bonds tumbled to their lowest level in years as investors recalibrated their portfolios to a world of persistent inflation and rising interest rates.Towering above it all was the U.S. dollar, which has rocketed to its highest level in 20 years against a basket of currencies, lifted in part by investors seeking shelter from the wild swings in markets.""The question is now not whether we are going into a recession, it is how deep will the recession be, and might we have some form of financial crisis and major global liquidity shock,"" said Mike Riddell, a senior fixed income portfolio manager at Allianz Global Investors in London.Because monetary policy tends to work with a lag, Riddell estimates the renewed hawkishness from central banks means the global economy will be even weaker by the middle of next year.","['Nasdaq', 'Allianz Global Investors', 'Riddell']",[]

Rupee plumbs fresh low at close amid risk-off mood,26 September,"The Indian rupee marked its record low close for a fourth straight session on Monday as the British pound's weakness propped up the dollar index further in a risk averse environment. The partially convertible rupee slid 0.8% to 81.6225 per dollar, having touched an all-time low of 81.6526 during the day, as stocks and currencies tumbled across Asia on global growth concerns. The dollar index traded above 113-levels for the first time since 2002 as deep tax cuts in the UK sent the sterling to a record low. The greenback has surged since the Federal Reserve sent hawkish signals last week, which forced the rupee to notch its worst weekly performance in one and a half years. During the day, the Reserve Bank of India is suspected to have sold dollars via state-run banks around the 81.50-81.55 level to avert a larger decline in the rupee, four traders told Reuters. The rupee, after opening at around 81.55, traded in a 21-paisa range. ""We expect the RBI to continue with significant intervention to stall rupee depreciation pressures, especially as the USD/INR pair moves towards 82 levels,"" HDFC economists wrote in a note. However, if risk-off continues on worries over recession and the Ukraine-Russia war, it could keep the dollar stronger for longer and ""rupee could then see a sustained depreciation trend over the next six-eight months, despite RBI intervention,"" they added. The central bank's foreign exchange reserves fell for a seventh straight week, down by $5.7 billion to $545.652 billion in the week to Sept. 16, RBI data on Friday showed. Some analysts raised concerns about the pace of decline in reserves. ""We are nowhere near a crisis situation, but the pace of reserves usage is unsustainable,"" said Alvin Tan, head of Asia forex strategy at RBC Capital Markets. Another key event at the end of this week is the RBI monetary policy committee's decision on interest rates.

RBI may raise repo by 50 bps this week: Economists,26 September,"The Reserve Bank of India’s rate-setting panel is likely to raise policy rates by 50 basis points at its meeting this week, economists said, as the dollar’s strength derived from the US Federal Reserve’s aggressive rate action has complicated the Indian central bank’s efforts to ease rate hikes after raising them by 1.4% since May.All 10 economists surveyed by Mint unanimously expect RBI’s monetary policy committee (MPC) to hike the repo rate by 50 basis points to 5.9%, with the majority expecting a change in stance from “withdrawal of accommodation” to “neutral”. The unanimous expectation of a 50 bps hike is a departure from expectations of a 25-35 bps hike just weeks back by many economists. They had then expected the panel to ease the pace of rate hikes on slower-than-expected economic growth in the June quarter.RBI’s effort to ensure economic growth isn’t derailed is also complicated by the surprise acceleration in August inflation to 7% after easing for three consecutive months until July.“Inflation remains high at around 7%, and is unlikely to come down soon. This means that a rate hike is a given. However, the quantum is what the market would be interested in. While a hike of 25-35 bps would have signalled that RBI is confident that the worst of inflation is over, recent developments in the forex market could prompt a higher quantum of 50 bps to stay on track with other markets so as to retain investor interest,” said Madan Sabnavis, chief economist, Bank of Baroda.Central banks from Switzerland to South Africa have joined a stampede towards higher interest rates following the Fed’s decision last week to rein in inflation and stabilize forex markets. While India is relatively more buffered from global headwinds, including a possible recession in the US, rising interest rates in the world’s largest economy can lead to a sustained outflow of investments from Indian bonds and stocks to dollar assets. The impact of the Fed’s actions and hawkish commentary led to the rupee hitting a new low against the dollar, breaching the 81 level. A weakening rupee makes imports costlier for a country that gets more than 85% of its oil requirements from abroad.Depleting dollar reserves and deficit liquidity in the banking system have also limited the ability of the central bank to intervene in the forex market to shore up the rupee. In the eight months to mid-September, the nation’s forex reserves have depleted by almost $90 billion to $545.65 billion in the week ended 16 September.After nearly 40 months, the banking system’s liquidity slipped into deficit on 21 September on advance tax outflows for the second quarter and payments for government bonds.All this will weigh on the MPC members’ agenda when the committee meets from 28 to 30 September. While RBI’s inflation forecast for FY23 is likely to remain at 6.7%, economists expect a revision in the growth forecast to 7% from the current projection of 7.2%. Markets will, however, closely watch for RBI’s guidance on liquidity. From a liquidity surplus of ₹7 trillion at the beginning of the year, RBI had to infuse liquidity worth ₹21,873 crore into the banking system last week. “We think liquidity will remain tight as we head into the festival season with the increase in currency leakage, continued selling of dollars and buoyant credit growth. RBI is likely to continue conducting repo auctions so that the MIBOR and call money rate settle at the repo rate and do not stay permanently at the MSF rate (MSF rate is 25 bps higher than the repo rate),” said Kaushik Das, chief economist, Deutsche Bank India. Economists are now expecting another 35 bps hike in December, subject to inflation trajectory and rate hikes by global central banks.Share article on",https://www.vccircle.com//rbimay-raise-repo-by-50-bps-this-week-economists,Finance,"The Reserve Bank of India’s rate-setting panel is likely to raise policy rates by 50 basis points at its meeting this week, economists said, as the dollar’s strength derived from the US Federal Reserve’s aggressive rate action has complicated the Indian central bank’s efforts to ease rate hikes after raising them by 1.4% since May.All 10 economists surveyed by Mint unanimously expect RBI’s monetary policy committee (MPC) to hike the repo rate by 50 basis points to 5.9%, with the majority expecting a change in stance from “withdrawal of accommodation” to “neutral”.In the eight months to mid-September, the nation’s forex reserves have depleted by almost $90 billion to $545.65 billion in the week ended 16 September.After nearly 40 months, the banking system’s liquidity slipped into deficit on 21 September on advance tax outflows for the second quarter and payments for government bonds.All this will weigh on the MPC members’ agenda when the committee meets from 28 to 30 September.","['The Reserve Bank of India’s', 'the US Federal Reserve’s', 'Mint', 'RBI', 'MPC', 'MPC']","['almost $90 billion to $545.65 billion', '₹7 trillion', '21,873']"

Zetwerk's FY22 revenue and GMV jump six-fold,22 September,"Business-to-business (B2B) manufacturing services unicorn Zetwerk, on Thursday announced a six-fold rise in its revenue and gross merchandise value (GMV) for financial year-ended March 2022. According to an earnings statement, the company’s operating revenue rose sharply to Rs 4,961 crore compared to Rs 835 crore in FY21, while GMV came in at Rs 5,718 crore versus Rs 951 crore during the previous year. Zetwerk has also claimed to have turned operationally profitable for the first time in FY22, reporting its Ebitda (earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortization) at Rs 57 crore, excluding Esop (employee stock option) expenses.

US Fed set for big rate hike as waters get choppy for world's central banks,21 September,"US Federal Reserve is expected on Wednesday to lift interest rates by three-quarters of a percentage point for a third straight time and signal how much further and how fast borrowing costs may need to rise to tame a potentially corrosive outbreak of inflation.The policy decision, due to be announced at 2 p.m. EDT (1800 GMT), will mark the latest move in a synchronized policy shift by global central banks that is testing the resilience of the world's economy and the ability of countries to manage exchange rate shocks as the value of the dollar soars.While investors largely expect the Fed to lift its policy rate by 75 basis points to the 3.00%-3.25% range, markets could be unsettled by the updated quarterly economic projections that will be released along with the policy statement.Those projections will show where Fed policymakers think interest rates are heading, how long it will take inflation to fall, and how much ""pain"" is likely to be inflicted on U.S. employment and economic growth along the way.If the past few months are any prologue, that rewritten economic script will point to a tougher-than-expected fight ahead, with a federal funds rate that may top 4% by the end of 2022, versus the 3.4% that was expected when the last set of projections were issued in June, and rising unemployment.""With little evidence in hand that inflation pressures are abating, (Chair Jerome Powell) is likely to re-emphasize the Fed's commitment to do what is necessary to bring inflation to target, even if that means risking a recession,"" Deutsche Bank economists wrote late last week. ""They will ... foresee tighter monetary policy and greater pain in the labor market.""Deutsche Bank expects the U.S. central bank to eventually need to raise its policy rate to around 5.00%, a level approaching the peak of 5.25% seen from mid-2006 to 2007 when Fed policymakers were concerned about a bubble in the U.S. housing market, and one that could amplify stress across the global financial system.Powell is scheduled to hold a news conference at 2:30 p.m. to elaborate on the latest policy decision, and his tone will shape whether it is interpreted as a hawkish next step with more of the same ahead, or as a final bit of rate-hike ""front-loading"" before the Fed reverts to more conventional rate increases of 50 or 25 basis points as it feel its way to a stopping point.Powell has had to correct himself in real time about the Fed's likely path twice this year. In June, after he largely ruled out hiking rates by three-quarters of a percentage point, a surprise jump in inflation unnerved the policymaking Federal Open Market Committee and pushed its members towards the larger increase. In July, Powell's comment that the Fed might move to smaller incremental rate increases was read as indicating an imminent policy pivot.The Fed chief's tone since then has become ardently hawkish, and, with the central bank's preferred measure of inflation running more than three times its 2% target, another dose of tough talk is anticipated.""Risks still skew toward higher terminal policy rates and we expect a relatively hawkish FOMC meeting,"" Citi economists wrote on Tuesday.'PRESENT DANGER'The hawkish stance has become the norm globally as central bankers dial up interest rate moves not seen since the 1990s, at the tail end of a fight in the developed world against inflation that had become entrenched in the 1970s.The European Central Bank, following the Fed, earlier this month raised its key interest rate by three-quarters of a percentage point for the first time ever; Sweden's central bank this week approved its first full-percentage-point increase in 30 years.The Bank of England and the central banks of Switzerland and Norway will meet this week, with markets expecting them to announce large rate hikes.Such increases in borrowing costs can feed off each other, changing currency, price and trade dynamics in ways that prompt other central banks to react, particularly in emerging markets where exchange rate fluctuations and rising dollar interest rates can cause unexpected financial shocks.Led by the Fed's intensifying focus on fighting inflation, the tightening has become so pronounced that some have begun worrying about overkill.""Central banks nearly everywhere feel accused of being on the back foot,"" in failing to anticipate to prevent the jump of inflation in 2021, Maurice Obstfeld, the former chief economist of the International Monetary Fund, wrote in an essay last week published by the Peterson Institute for International Economics. ""The present danger, however, is not so much that current and planned moves will fail eventually to quell inflation. It is that they collectively go too far and drive the world economy into an unnecessarily harsh contraction.""Between the aftershocks from the COVID-19 pandemic and the Russian invasion of Ukraine, World Bank President David Malpass warned last week that the global economy could be approaching ""a protracted period of feeble growth and elevated inflation.""Share article on",https://www.vccircle.com//usfed-set-for-big-rate-hike-as-waters-get-choppy-for-world-s-central-banks,Finance,"US Federal Reserve is expected on Wednesday to lift interest rates by three-quarters of a percentage point for a third straight time and signal how much further and how fast borrowing costs may need to rise to tame a potentially corrosive outbreak of inflation.The policy decision, due to be announced at 2 p.m. EDT (1800 GMT), will mark the latest move in a synchronized policy shift by global central banks that is testing the resilience of the world's economy and the ability of countries to manage exchange rate shocks as the value of the dollar soars.While investors largely expect the Fed to lift its policy rate by 75 basis points to the 3.00%-3.25% range, markets could be unsettled by the updated quarterly economic projections that will be released along with the policy statement.Those projections will show where Fed policymakers think interest rates are heading, how long it will take inflation to fall, and how much ""pain"" is likely to be inflicted on U.S. employment and economic growth along the way.If the past few months are any prologue, that rewritten economic script will point to a tougher-than-expected fight ahead, with a federal funds rate that may top 4% by the end of 2022, versus the 3.4% that was expected when the last set of projections were issued in June, and rising unemployment.'PRESENT DANGER'The hawkish stance has become the norm globally as central bankers dial up interest rate moves not seen since the 1990s, at the tail end of a fight in the developed world against inflation that had become entrenched in the 1970s.The European Central Bank, following the Fed, earlier this month raised its key interest rate by three-quarters of a percentage point for the first time ever; Sweden's central bank this week approved its first full-percentage-point increase in 30 years.The Bank of England and the central banks of Switzerland and Norway will meet this week, with markets expecting them to announce large rate hikes.Such increases in borrowing costs can feed off each other, changing currency, price and trade dynamics in ways that prompt other central banks to react, particularly in emerging markets where exchange rate fluctuations and rising dollar interest rates can cause unexpected financial shocks.Led by the Fed's intensifying focus on fighting inflation, the tightening has become so pronounced that some have begun worrying about overkill.","['US Federal Reserve', 'GMT', 'Fed', 'Fed', 'The European Central Bank', 'Fed', 'The Bank of England', 'Fed']",[]

Hotel owners can self-enroll, and manage bookings and services on its app. The startup is now focusing on four main regions: India, Malaysia, Indonesia and Europe, where it manages vacation homes and has cut down operations in markets it previously considered crucial, such as the US and China, where its employees now measure in the single digits.In October last year, Oyo had filed its Drhp to raise ₹8,430 crore through initial public offering (IPO).

Alchemy Capital launches new category III fund AIF,20 September,"Mumbai-based portfolio and asset management company, Alchemy Capital Management Pvt. Ltd, on Tuesday announced the launch of its new category-III alternative investment fund (AIF) aiming to raise upwards of Rs 500 crore over a tenure of four years.    The Alchemy Emerging Leaders Of Tomorrow fund will include a sector-agnostic portfolio of 20-25 stocks, that will largely focus on small and midcap companies with minimum 65% allocation, a statement said. The portfolio will also include investments in large cap and 10% allocation will be for IPO opportunities, it added. The final close of the fund will be in December 2022, the company said without disclosing information on the quantum of the first close.The firm aims to raise capital from resident and non-resident Indians, high net worth individuals (HNIs), Hindu undivided Family (HUF), banks, accredited investors and trusts, and will be managed by co-founder and chief executive officer, Hiren Ved and colleague Mythili Balakrishnan.  Balakrishnan has over 19 years of experience in finance and markets, especially in equity analysis and fund management. “India is at the cusp of a solid economic recovery led by manufacturing and digital-led businesses. While investors have already played the consolidation story of backing current leaders, our aim is to bet on entrepreneurs with more agile and innovative business models,” Hiren Ved said in the statement.  Back in January 2022, Ved had told Mint in an interaction, “We are not buying small and midcaps that will become large caps.

"Oyo updates Q1 financials with Sebi, pushes for IPO this year",19 September,"Hospitality unicorn Oyo, operated by Oravel Stays Limited, reported a loss of Rs 413.9 crore for Q1FY23, as it prepares internally for a public listing this year. The company said it is has turned operationally profitable for the first time in the quarter-ended June before accounting for costs related to its employee stock option grants. The company is now looking for an IPO in the third quarter of FY23 -- or before December 2022 --  provided market conditions remain conducive, people familiar with the matter said.  Oyo reported an adjusted Ebitda (earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation and ammortization) of Rs 7 crore before 'share based expenses'. Share based expenses are related to Esop (employee stock option) grants. This was driven by growth in monthly gross bookings value per hotel, according to the people cited above.  According to documents filed with markets regulator Sebi, Oyo's loss for FY22 came in at Rs 2,139.9 crore versus Rs 4,103.3 crore in the previous fiscal.  The SoftBank-backed firm reported its FY22 Ebitda loss at Rs 471.7 crore in FY22 versus a loss of Rs 1,744.7 crore in FY21. With the additional filing, OYO is seeking to revive its plans for an initial public offering (IPO) in tough economic conditions. It had filed its draft red herring prospectus (DRHP) with Sebi last year in October. Earlier in May 2022, it had sought Sebi’s permission to include restated financial statements for the six months ending September for fiscal years 2022, 2021 and 2020.  The Gurugram-based startup was founded by Ritesh Agarwal. The company delayed the public market debut initially planned for September 2022 at a lower valuation of around $7-8 billion versus the earlier planned figure of $11 billion. The Softbank-backed hospitality company said that its monthly gross bookings value per hotel saw a 47% growth in the first quarter FY23 to Rs 3.25 lakh from Rs 2.21 lakh in the financial year 2022. The recovery comes on the back of rising travel demand due to the ease in domestic movement restrictions in the market where it operates. The company is focusing on markets including India, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Europe. Moreover, in May this year, the hospitality giant acquired Direct Booker for $5.5 million to strengthen its presence in Europe. The European company manages more than 3,200 vacation homes in Croatia.

Warburg eyes 30% stake in shadow bank Vistaar for $150 million,16 September,"New York-based private equity firm Warburg Pincus LLC is in talks to invest around $150 million in Indian small-business lender Vistaar Finance, two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters, marking its latest bet in a booming lending market.Warburg's discussions with Vistaar are for a 30% stake in the shadow lender, the two sources said. Deal talks are at an advanced stage and will value Vistaar at roughly $450 million, said one of the sources.Businesses like Vistaar in India operate as non-banking financial services companies (NBFC), lending smaller amounts than traditional banks do and targeting mostly customers in towns and villages.By March 2021, India's NBFC sector had assets worth more than 54 trillion rupees ($680 billion). Its growth in recent years has attracted investors including Sequoia Capital and KKR & Co.Vistaar is already backed by India's Saama Capital and Westbridge Capital. It and Warburg declined to comment on Reuters queries.India's Kotak Mahindra Capital is advising Vistaar on the talks for the private equity deal. The investment bank did not respond to a request for comment.""NBFCs are one of the biggest sectors for PE funds and have a proven track record of performance,"" the first source added, explaining the rationale of Warburg's interest.Founded in 2010, Vistaar provides small business loans to shops, mills, hotels and manufacturers. It operates 196 branches in 12 Indian states and has lent more than $300 million so far, according to its website.It says it typically extends business loans of $1,200 to $60,000 for five to 10 years.The first source also said that, apart from fresh shares being issued by Vistaar, Warburg may acquire shares held existing investors, though it was not yet clear which of them might exit.For the fiscal year to March 2022, Vistaar recorded a net profit of $9.3 million, 14.5% more than a year before, according to credit rating firm ICRA.

What India's inclusion into major global bond indexes could mean,16 September,"The possibility of India being included in global bond indexes this year has led to increased buying in a set of local securities.A decision on whether to include the south Asian country into the J.P.Morgan Government Bond Index-Emerging Markets (GBI-EM) could come as early as this month when okthe operators meet to review the composition of the index.Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs expect India to be included in the index by 2023, with a 10% weightage, if an initial announcement is made this year.Meanwhile, Barclays said India could also possibly be added to the Bloomberg Global Aggregate bond index.WHAT PROMPTED TALKS OF INCLUSION?The Indian government began considering listing its securities for an inclusion in global bond indexes as far back as 2013. However, restrictions on foreign investments in Indian debt meant that the country had to roll out a number of steps before its securities could be eligible.In April 2020, the Reserve Bank of India introduced a clutch of securities that were exempt from any restrictions under a ""fully accessible route"" for foreign investors. This was seen as a middle path that helps balance India's concerns of ""hot money"" outflows while opening up part of its securities fully for foreign investors.WHAT HURDLES REMAIN?A key hurdle in the index entry is the ability to clear and settle Indian debt on an international platform like Euroclear.This would require removing or lowering capital gains tax compared to what domestic investors would pay.An easier workaround would be to settle the debt locally, which Reuters reported may be a preferred way for the government. Read full storyWHICH SECURITIES ARE EXPECTED TO BE LISTED?The securities under the ""fully accessible route"" are likely to be the ones chosen for inclusion to the index. All new issues of government securities of 5-year, 10-year and 30-year tenors starting 2020-21 fall under this.Foreign investors have already started buying bonds in this category since last month, data showed. Read full storyHOW MUCH INFLOWS CAN WE EXPECT?Passive inflows of around $30 billion are expected from India's inclusion, but they would be staggered over 10 months from the month of joining as the 10% allocation itself would be phased, according to Morgan Stanley.Barclays expects inflows of another $8 billion to $20 billion if India is added to the Bloomberg Global Aggregate bond index.WHAT DOES THIS MEAN FOR INDIAN MARKETS?India's fiscal deficit shot up during the COVID-19 crisis and the government aims to lower it to 6.4% of GDP in this fiscal year ending March 2023 from 6.9% last year.Financing the budget means that the government will borrow a record 14.31 trillion Indian rupees ($180.06 billion) this financial year.While inflows via a global bond index entry will be small in comparison, they will add another source of demand for Indian securities.Additionally, India's monthly trade deficit coming near record levels has made it imminent to seek new avenues of dollar inflows and this move is a ""good and safe way of tapping into global capital,"" said Madhavi Arora, lead economist at Emkay Global.IS THERE A DOWNSIDE?A bond index entry will also expose the Indian debt markets to greater volatility linked to passive flows which allocate capital based on the weightage assigned by the index provider.The volatility could become a ""headache"" for the RBI, said Madan Sabnavis, chief economist at Bank of Baroda.Any changes in sentiment or broader events like sell-offs or interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve will turn Indian debt markets more vulnerable as foreign investors start withdrawing their money, Sabnavis said.Share article on",https://www.vccircle.com//whatindia-s-inclusion-into-major-global-bond-indexes-could-mean,Finance,"The possibility of India being included in global bond indexes this year has led to increased buying in a set of local securities.A decision on whether to include the south Asian country into the J.P.Morgan Government Bond Index-Emerging Markets (GBI-EM) could come as early as this month when okthe operators meet to review the composition of the index.Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs expect India to be included in the index by 2023, with a 10% weightage, if an initial announcement is made this year.Meanwhile, Barclays said India could also possibly be added to the Bloomberg Global Aggregate bond index.WHAT PROMPTED TALKS OF INCLUSION?The Indian government began considering listing its securities for an inclusion in global bond indexes as far back as 2013.Read full storyHOW MUCH INFLOWS CAN WE EXPECT?Passive inflows of around $30 billion are expected from India's inclusion, but they would be staggered over 10 months from the month of joining as the 10% allocation itself would be phased, according to Morgan Stanley.Barclays expects inflows of another $8 billion to $20 billion if India is added to the Bloomberg Global Aggregate bond index.WHAT DOES THIS MEAN FOR INDIAN MARKETS?India's fiscal deficit shot up during the COVID-19 crisis and the government aims to lower it to 6.4% of GDP in this fiscal year ending March 2023 from 6.9% last year.Financing the budget means that the government will borrow a record 14.31 trillion Indian rupees ($180.06 billion) this financial year.While inflows via a global bond index entry will be small in comparison, they will add another source of demand for Indian securities.Additionally, India's monthly trade deficit coming near record levels has made it imminent to seek new avenues of dollar inflows and this move is a ""good and safe way of tapping into global capital,"" said Madhavi Arora, lead economist at Emkay Global.IS THERE A DOWNSIDE?A bond index entry will also expose the Indian debt markets to greater volatility linked to passive flows which allocate capital based on the weightage assigned by the index provider.The volatility could become a ""headache"" for the RBI, said Madan Sabnavis, chief economist at Bank of Baroda.Any changes in sentiment or broader events like sell-offs or interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve will turn Indian debt markets more vulnerable as foreign investors start withdrawing their money, Sabnavis said.Share article on","['the J.P.Morgan Government Bond Index-Emerging Markets', 'GBI-EM', 'Morgan Stanley', 'Goldman Sachs', 'Barclays', 'the Bloomberg Global Aggregate', 'Morgan Stanley', 'the Bloomberg Global Aggregate', ""INDIAN MARKETS?India's"", 'COVID-19', 'RBI', 'Bank of Baroda', 'the Federal Reserve']","['around $30 billion', '$8 billion to $20 billion', '14.31 trillion', '$180.06 billion']"

Since its acquisition, WhiteHat Jr. has contributed Rs 326.66 crore to BYJU'S revenue. Its FY22 losses are also high, as reported on August 4.  Meanwhile, Byju’s has to make the balance payment to Blackstone by September 23, the statements said. According to Raveendran, the delay was on account of an RBI pricing guideline for non-resident investors.  GST Raids The Directorate General of GST Intelligence finalised its investigation on February 18, 2021, against books supplied during the period July 2017 to  October 2020. The company was asked to pay GST of Rs 96.17 crore, the interest of Rs 27.95 crore and a penalty of Rs 14.43 crore. “The authority has concluded the investigation without issuing show cause notice since the GST liability was accepted and paid by the parent company of Byju’s.”  Auditor flags accounting changes Byju’s loss widened after changes in revenue recognition.  The auditor has flagged two key changes. Revenues from streaming services, which were previously recognised fully on the commencement of the contract, have been adjusted to be recognised rateably over the period of the contract.   For example, if Byju’s sold a two-year course, the company would have taken the complete sale amount as revenue in the same financial year. But this time, the revenues were deferred over the span of time the course remains valid.  The auditor added that interest paid to loan partners on behalf of customers in respect of loans granted directly to customers has been reclassified from finance cost and adjusted against revenues since these payments are in the nature of payments to customers. Similarly, Byju’s provides First Loss Default Guarantees (FLDG) to its loan partners and is obligated to reimburse for any monthly instalments that remain uncollected and stay overdue for a prescribed period which typically ranges between “overdue for 75 days or 90 days.”   The company’s revenues were revised to include the difference between the consideration received by the parent from the (i) customer and the loan partner and (ii) the fair value of the guarantee at the time of entering into the contract with the customer.   The auditor has noted the estimates of the fair value of guarantee are revisited at the end of every period closing and any changes in the fair value are accounted for as a change in the estimates.Share article on",https://www.vccircle.com//insidebyju-s-financials-look-at-its-soaring-losses-shrinking-revenues,Finance,"Drop in India earnings; US, Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) revenue up Byju’s reported increased revenues from the sale of educational content to customers based in Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries, which amounted to Rs 497 crore in FY21--up from Rs 245 crore in the previous fiscal.Similarly, Byju’s provides First Loss Default Guarantees (FLDG) to its loan partners and is obligated to reimburse for any monthly instalments that remain uncollected and stay overdue for a prescribed period which typically ranges between “overdue for 75 days or 90 days.”   The company’s revenues were revised to include the difference between the consideration received by the parent from the (i) customer and the loan partner and (ii) the fair value of the guarantee at the time of entering into the contract with the customer.","['Gulf Cooperation Council', 'Gulf Cooperation Council', 'First Loss Default Guarantees', 'FLDG']",['about $22 billion']

"Skill or chance: Govt panel calls for regulatory body, new law for online gaming",15 September,"India should create a regulatory body to classify online games as based on skill or chance, introduce rules to block prohibited formats and take a stricter stance on gambling websites, a government panel said in a report seen by Reuters.The panel of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's top officials has for months been drafting regulations for the country's online gaming sector, where foreign investors such as Tiger Global and Sequoia Capital have backed gaming startups Dream11 and Mobile Premier League, hugely popular for fantasy cricket.The much-awaited report is seen as shaping the future of the mobile gaming industry in India, estimated to reach $5 billion by 2025, from $1.5 billion this year. It comes amid rising concerns over games causing addiction and ""inconsistent state laws"" disrupting business.Simply defining games has been contentious. India's Supreme Court says the card game rummy and certain fantasy games are skill-based and legal, but at least one state court classified games such as poker as chance-based, or akin to gambling, which is banned in most states.In its confidential draft report dated Aug. 31, the panel of government officials calls for creation of a new regulatory body under India's IT ministry to determine which online games qualify as games of skill, then ""seek compliances and enforcement.""To streamline the legal framework, the 108-page report says India needs a new federal online gaming law, which will provide regulatory flexibility ""with punishment provisions, along with blocking powers, for the government against prohibited gaming formats"".Though the panel considered only online skill games, and not gambling, which is handled by states, it noted that many offshore betting and gambling websites that are illegal in India have become popular among Indian users. The new legal framework would apply to both free and pay-to-play skill games.""On the aspect of prohibiting games of chance (e.g. gambling websites or apps) being played online, the proposed Digital India Act can include it in the list of prohibited user harms that will not be permitted,"" the report stated.A senior government source said that although the federal government could classify chance-based games as harmful, it would let states make the final call on whether to allow gambling.The report noted that state governments already find it ""difficult to implement and monitor geo-fencing measures"" to ensure that no user in their region is accessing an illegal forms of gambling or gaming.The IT ministry will finalise the report after receiving further comments from panel members, who are some of Modi's top bureaucrats, including the heads of the revenue and sports ministries. It will then be sent to the cabinet secretariat for approval, though there is no timeline for finalisation.The IT Ministry did not respond to Reuters queries. The panel members did not immediately respond to requests for comment.ADDICTION MEASURESA senior gaming industry executive said the recommendation that a regulatory body evaluate different formats of online games could raise entry barriers for new players and increase scrutiny of companies' current offerings.Still, the executive said, new regulations will bring ""regulatory clarity, certainty and investments for the sector."" The executive declined to be named because of the sensitivity of the matter.A 2020 report by Indian trade group FICCI and consulting firm EY stated that of 65 billion Indian rupees ($817 million) garnered by online gaming industry the previous year, transaction-based gaming, including real-money, contributed 71%, or 46 billion rupees.Endorsements by top Indian cricketers and other marketing efforts have boosted appeal and investor interest of real money gaming apps. Dream11 commands a valuation of $8 billion, while Mobile Premier League is valued at $2.5 billion, PitchBook data shows. By 2021, there were 95 million paying gamers in India.The government report noted that proliferation of such games among the youth had led to addiction that often caused financial losses, with some reported cases of suicides.The report calls for laws and rules to include so-called ""de-addiction measures"" such as periodic warnings and advisories and fixing deposit and withdrawal limits. It also calls for ""responsible advertising"".For online games such as fantasy cricket on Dream11, paid contests remain the popular attraction. Users can create their teams by paying as little as 14 rupees (17 U.S. cents), with a total prize pool of 7 million rupees ($88,000) up for grabs by winners. The top ranking performer can take home 275,000 rupees ($3,462).After receiving suggestions from India's revenue department, the government panel stated that online gaming companies should be required to report any ""suspicious transactions"" to the government's Financial Intelligence Unit.Share article on",https://www.vccircle.com//skillor-chance-govt-panel-calls-for-regulatory-body-new-law-for-online-gaming,Finance,"India should create a regulatory body to classify online games as based on skill or chance, introduce rules to block prohibited formats and take a stricter stance on gambling websites, a government panel said in a report seen by Reuters.The panel of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's top officials has for months been drafting regulations for the country's online gaming sector, where foreign investors such as Tiger Global and Sequoia Capital have backed gaming startups Dream11 and Mobile Premier League, hugely popular for fantasy cricket.The much-awaited report is seen as shaping the future of the mobile gaming industry in India, estimated to reach $5 billion by 2025, from $1.5 billion this year.""On the aspect of prohibiting games of chance (e.g. gambling websites or apps) being played online, the proposed Digital India Act can include it in the list of prohibited user harms that will not be permitted,"" the report stated.A senior government source said that although the federal government could classify chance-based games as harmful, it would let states make the final call on whether to allow gambling.The report noted that state governments already find it ""difficult to implement and monitor geo-fencing measures"" to ensure that no user in their region is accessing an illegal forms of gambling or gaming.The IT ministry will finalise the report after receiving further comments from panel members, who are some of Modi's top bureaucrats, including the heads of the revenue and sports ministries.","['Reuters', 'Sequoia Capital', 'Mobile Premier League', 'Digital India Act']","['$5 billion', '$1.5 billion', '$817 million', '46 billion', '$8 billion', '$2.5 billion', '17 U.S. cents', '88,000', '3,462).After']"
Moonshine-maker Ronin Wines rakes in fresh funding,15 September,"Ronin Wines, which sells mead under the brand name Moonshine Meadery, on Thursday announced that it has raised $2 million in its pre-series A funding round led by Anthill Capitaland. The round also saw the participation of Auxano Capital, Supermorpheus and Merisis. Existing and new angel investors also participated in the mop-up. Value Bridge Capital was the sole adviser for the transaction. Ronin Wines plans to use the funds to boost its growth trajectory in the country by deepening Moonshine’s presence in its existing markets such as Maharashtra, Karnataka, Goa, Uttar Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh, Rajasthan, Assam and Silvassa. The company also plans to tap into new markets such as Haryana and West Bengal.  “Alco-beverage is a large and growing sector with white spaces. Mead as a beverage is new to the India markets,” said Karan Gupta, associate Auxano Capital. Ronin Wines said that it is aiming to establish Moonshine as a national brand over the next three years. The investment will also aid the company in commencing work on export markets.In 2021, the startup launched strong meads brand Portside. The firm is now looking at venturing into the high ABV (alcohol by volume) still-meads segment later this year. “With Moonshine, we are trying to plug the flavour gap for consumers as they transition from juices and colas to beers and spirits. A consumer’s journey into alcohol doesn’t have to start with an ‘acquired taste’. This fits well with the expectations of the younger India who are looking for more flavourful beverages,” said Rohan Rehani, co-founder, Ronin Wines.“We have been steadily garnering interest from importers in various geographies. And now,  this fundraise will enable us to unlock opportunities not only at the national but also at the international level,” Rehani added. Founded by Rehani and Nitin Vishwas, Ronin Wines launched Moonshine in 2016 to bring back the ancient alcoholic beverage. The beverage is made by fermenting pure honey and then blending it with various fruits and spices. The company makes meads which are predominantly low alcohol and carbonated, it said in a statement. The Indian Council for Research on International Economic Relations estimates that India's market for alcoholic beverages is expected to grow at an annual growth rate of 6.8% between 2020 and 2023, making it one of the fastest-growing markets. Share article on",https://www.vccircle.com//moonshinemaker-ronin-wines-rakes-in-fresh-funding,Finance,"Ronin Wines plans to use the funds to boost its growth trajectory in the country by deepening Moonshine’s presence in its existing markets such as Maharashtra, Karnataka, Goa, Uttar Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh, Rajasthan, Assam and Silvassa.The Indian Council for Research on International Economic Relations estimates that India's market for alcoholic beverages is expected to grow at an annual growth rate of 6.8% between 2020 and 2023, making it one of the fastest-growing markets.","['Ronin Wines', 'Uttar Pradesh', 'Himachal Pradesh', 'The Indian Council for Research on International Economic Relations']",['$2 million']

‘We'll become cashflow positive by Mar quarter',15 September,"Under scrutiny from investors and regulators, Byju Raveendran, co-founder and chief executive of edtech firm Byju’s, appeared confident on Wednesday as he shared his company’s financials for FY21 after an 18-month delay. In an interview, Raveendran spoke about the delay in filing financials, the accounting changes that led to a drop in FY21 revenue, allegations of mis-selling of products, the company’s fundraising plan, and its aggressive acquisition strategy. Edited excerpts:How would you sum up your FY21 earnings?Though there has been good business growth from FY20 to FY21, almost 40% of that revenue got deferred on account of recognition change. Because of this recognition change, you won’t see any growth coming from FY21. The revenue got pushed out from FY21 to subsequent years even as we have already accounted for the entire cost for businesses. Though our business was profitable from FY20 onwards, last year, and (for the) last two years, we have made fast-growing but loss-making acquisitions that have affected revenue. This, combined with revenue getting pushed out, has increased the losses to ₹4,500 crore. I just want you to understand, you know, that there has been a 40% downward revision.What about FY22? And what about the revenue run rate as of date?We have (seen) huge growth from FY21 to FY22. So, there is no covid pullback in any of our businesses. Byju’s has grown 150%, and Aakash and Great Learning have doubled since their acquisitions. Great Learning is less talked about, but it’s silently growing. WhitehatJr has underperformed, although the product is very strong. And like all the customer research, we see a very high NPS (net promoter score) provider in it. But we have to solve for (the high) cost of acquisition.But what caused this inordinate delay in declaring your results?It is a tough question to answer, but without blaming anyone for it, I’ll say the first initial one to three months was on account of covid. The second reason, and I’m talking in terms of timeline, not necessarily in terms of the time, was because of the added acquisitions, both pre-pandemic and post-pandemic. Even that has added some delay. Last eight, or nine months, it was delayed because of this revenue recognition change, streaming revenue and credit sales revenue getting accounted for during the consumption of the product or during the significant collection of the EMI sales. That took a lot of time because it was such a big recognition change. So, they did additional work. But now, we have an unqualified report (by the auditors) that puts all anxiety to rest.But we hear there were two noteworthy remarks from the auditor.Audit qualification is a very scary thing. So, there is no qualification. It is an unqualified report. What is there is an opinion on controls and another on revenue recognition.Can you specify what internal controls mean?There is an adverse opinion on controls. But that is very common. Because when there is so much delay, that’s only because of these credit sales (sales made through loans). On these things controls and the finance function have to improve, and we have already started improving. We actually now have a global CFO (chief financial officer). As and when we get ready to go public, we will also strengthen our finance function significantly.Can you clarify what the management’s revenue projections were for FY21?Around 40% of the total revenue got pushed out.What is the current revenue run rate?Up to July 2022, we did ₹4,500 crore in revenue this financial year. And last year, that number was approximately ₹.10,000 crore.What are your fundraising plans?There are two rounds which we are looking at, which anyway we’ll announce once we close. So, there is a straight equity round at the same value, which is $22 billion. And there is also a converter we are looking at, which will convert at IPO at a 20% discount. So, these two discussions we are having with many investors. While some investors would prefer to convert, there are investors who like to come in for straight equity.Can you talk about unit economics? By when will you be profitable?At the consolidated level, we will be cashflow-positive by either the fourth quarter of this year or by the first quarter of next year. And at the consolidated level, I’m talking about cashflow-positive. The business will be Ebitda-positive even before that.What caused the delay in payment for the Aakash acquisition?There was no delay. It is based on an RBI pricing guideline. As per the mutual agreement between buyer and seller, we have to do it very conservatively. The actual reason is that the pricing guidelines have to be met because in a transaction with a non-resident, you can’t use that fair market value. The FMV has to move up; otherwise, paying more than FMV (fair market value) is not possible. We initially thought a two-month delta would be enough to reach the FMV. But to be even more conservative, we kept a three-month buffer, and so now, if you ask me, it’s like if Blackstone decides that okay, let’s be even more conservative and pay later. Because we have to get a valuation report and FMV has to go up. That’s the real reason.What exactly are your plans for inorganic growth?We’ve made so many acquisitions in the last 18 months; we are focusing on integrating them well. Currently, we are taking a measured approach in terms of looking at new acquisitions because there’s so much to be done in terms of integrating the previous ones. But opportunities are going to be a lot more in this segment, and we’ll see more consolidation over the next 12 months. And it’s almost like this- if you can acquire a US company, you can always make them more profitable by bringing part of the cost centre back to India, and not just that, most of these products will also have India as a revenue centre. So if you have strong distribution in India, some of the special products, if you bring here that adds as a revenue centre. So, there is a double advantage. And that’s why acquisitions work.Share article on",https://www.vccircle.com//wellbecome-cashflow-positive-by-mar-quarter,Finance,"But we have to solve for (the high) cost of acquisition.But what caused this inordinate delay in declaring your results?It is a tough question to answer, but without blaming anyone for it, I’ll say the first initial one to three months was on account of covid.As and when we get ready to go public, we will also strengthen our finance function significantly.Can you clarify what the management’s revenue projections were for FY21?Around 40% of the total revenue got pushed out.What is the current revenue run rate?Up to July 2022, we did ₹4,500 crore in revenue this financial year.",[],"['4,500', '$22 billion']"

Byju's FY21 loss widens after co changes revenue recognition,14 September,"Think and Learn Pvt. Ltd., the parent company of edtech decacorn Byju’s total comprehensive loss for the year ending March 2021 widened to Rs 4,588.75 crore from a loss of Rs 231.69 crore incurred in financial year ended March, 2020, the company's results show. Total comprehensive loss is the sum of company’s total loss and other items such as remeasurement of gains and exchange differences in translating the financial statements of foreign operations. Calling the blip as a result of the change in financial reporting structure, Byju Raveendran, the co-founder and chief executive of the firm said in an interview with Mint on Wednesday morning that subsequent year’s results will show a stronger financial growth and uptick in numbers. “There was significant business growth in FY21 over FY20, but since this is the first year where new revenue recognition started because of a Covid-related business model change, almost 40% of the revenue was deferred to subsequent years,” he told Mint. “The rationalized growth between FY21 and FY20 is a result of the changes made in the way the company recognizes its revenue, as advised by its auditors,” he said. The company has readjusted its revenue from operations to Rs 2,280 crore for FY21, which is 40% lower than what the management had previously projected. Mint had reported on 4 August that the company was expecting a downward revision of its FY21 revenue because of a change in its revenue recognition protocol, as mandated by the auditor.The company’s accounts are audited by Deloitte Haskins & Sells, one of the big four tax consulting firms globally. Byju’s, which was last valued at $22.6 billion based on an internal estimate, disclosed its audited and unqualified financial earnings report on Wednesday for the financial year ending 31 March, 2021, after a delay of more than 18 months.The audit report is unqualified. There are two ‘emphasis on matters’ items flagged by the auditor on the company’s revenue recognition methods and retrospectively adjusted numbers for FY20. The change in revenue recognition is twofold. The revenues from Byju’s ‘streaming services’, which was previously recognized fully on commencement of contract ‘has been adjusted to be recognized rateably over the period of contract.’ Secondly, the interest paid to lenders on behalf of customers is to be calculated net of revenue, without classifying it separately as a finance cost. (The company brokers an interest free loan to its customers via its lenders). The retrospectively readjusted numbers for FY20 and FY19 are very insignificant and do not materially impact the revenues, according to a person briefed on the report. As part of audit adjustments, the revenue for FY20 was reduced by Rs 191.77 crore from the previously reported FY20 revenue of Rs 2380.76 crore. Its net losses for FY20 widened by Rs 43.37 crore and net losses for FY19 widened by 80.04 crore. There is also an ‘adverse opinion’ on the company’s ‘internal controls’, which includes elements of customer collections and revenue recognition. The company has started the process of adding to its finance team which will improve controls and will be appointing a global chief executive shortly, Raveendran said. The company also reported a huge uptick in goodwill for FY21, on the back of its acquisitions. The firm, which has been on an acquisition spree, reported Rs 10,000 crore in gross revenues in FY22, Mint reported on 5 July. Between April-July 2022, the company logged a revenue of Rs 4,530 crore, Raveendran said. Over the last 18 months it has acquired companies such as Aakash Educational Services Ltd. (AESL), Great Learning, Epic, Tynker, Scholr, Toppr, Osmo and Gradup among others,The company is in the process of raising a new funding round of more than $500 million and counts investors such as Chan-Zuckerberg Initiative, Naspers, CPPIB, General Atlantic, Tencent, Sequoia Capital, Sofina, Verlinvest, IFC, Aarin Capital, TimesInternet, Lightspeed Ventures, Tiger Global, Owl Ventures & Qatar Investment Authority on its captable.Founded in 2011, by Byju Raveendran, Divya Gokulnath and Riju Raveendran, Byju’s is one of the biggest education companies in the country.

Sebi has no role in IPO pricing: chairperson,13 September,"Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) chairperson Madhabi Puri Buch on Tuesday said the regulator does not have any role in pricing of initial public offerings or IPOs, emphasizing the need for a thorough disclosure-based regime for better functioning of capital markets.Addressing FICCI’s capital markets event, Buch said “People are free to do what they want to do but they should make disclosures"", she said. In 2021, several new age technology companies came up with their initial public offerings. However, most companies are currently trading at lower prices despite having inflated valuations. This led to heavy destruction of investors’ wealth and also gave rise to a whole debate on the pricing of the issues and Sebi’s role in it.Buch said “A lot has been said on the pricing of the IPOs of new age technology companies. Our view is simple at what price you chose to do your IPO is your business, we have no business to suggest otherwise. The days of the CCI (Controller of Capital Issue) are long gone. Parliament has mandated Sebi that we should have no view on the pricing of issues. You are free to price the issue at whatever price you consider appropriate. The specific procedure however, is directed by Sebi which includes the way IPO documents are filed or the way that they are given in the public domain.““If a company is coming to IPO three-six months ago and has placed its equity with some party assuming a private party at ₹100 but wishes to come to the market at ₹450. We expect you to disclose to the investor what accounts for the difference between ₹100 and ₹450. What has changed ? It may be internal or external metrics . Essentially Sebi expects the disclosures pertaining to these aspects,"" she said.Sebi has been relying on data and technology which have proven to be of great help to the regulator in many aspects. “In today’s context, some regulations may be completely inappropriate. Going forward, for us, what is important is first principles and data. We invite data. Every single policy that comes out today is back-tested by data. There is not now a single piece of paper that moves within Sebi that is not backed by data. We will eschew dogma and we will embrace data,"" Buch said.She also pointed out that since the market dynamics are changing at an ever-increasing pace, technology is the ‘magic bullet’ that will help the regulator in solving a lot of financial misdoings like insider trading, front running, market manipulation etc that are common in the business ecosystem.Share article on",https://www.vccircle.com//ipopricing-is-the-company-s-business-not-sebi-s-chairperson-says,Finance,"This led to heavy destruction of investors’ wealth and also gave rise to a whole debate on the pricing of the issues and Sebi’s role in it.Buch said “A lot has been said on the pricing of the IPOs of new age technology companies.The specific procedure however, is directed by Sebi which includes the way IPO documents are filed or the way that they are given in the public domain.““If a company is coming to IPO three-six months ago and has placed its equity with some party assuming a private party at ₹100 but wishes to come to the market at ₹450.","['IPO', 'IPO']","['100', '450']"

91Squarefeet bags $10 mn in series A round,13 September,"Construction tech startup 91Squarefeet, on Tuesday announced that it has raised $10 million in a Series A round led by Stellaris Venture Partners. Existing investors Y Combinator, Betatron Venture Group and some angel investors also participated in the round.91Squarefeet plans to use the funds to strengthen its on-ground service and product development teams along with deepening engagement with its supplier network. Founded in 2019 by Amit Bansal, Amit Mishra and Puneet Bansal, 91Squarefeet enables brands to set up new physical stores. The company has a network of more than 600 contractors and factories.  91Squarefeet digitizes the supply chain around retail projects, reduces friction in collaboration and information exchange amongst stakeholders, said Amit Bansal, chief executive, 91Squarefeet.  The startup claims to have developed more than 700 stores for 40 brands across over 230 cities so far. Bansal said that in India, there is no direct competition for the startup as of now and that it competes with unorganized contractors and agencies as well as pits against a few big names in certain segments. Bridgestone, Yokohama, DHL, Tata, Chaipoint, Ceat and Pepperfry are some of the clients of 91Squarefeet, which is now planning to deepen its presence in markets it already operates. Without sharing the exact figures, Amit said that the southern market rakes in the most revenues for the Gurugram-headquartered startup, followed by the Western markets of Gujarat and Maharashtra.  “Demand for organized retail is growing, more so in tier II and III cities. However, a majority of brands struggle to expand their offline presence and tap into this massive opportunity. High dependence on small, unreliable suppliers often create inefficiencies leading to a 20-25% higher cost of building a retail store along with several weeks of delay,” said Rahul Chowdhri, partner, Stellaris Venture Partners. “91Squarefeet’s tech-enabled platform solves this very pain point, providing brands with a timely and cost-effective way of building their stores,” he added.The latest deal is the second financing round for 91Squarefeet this year. Previously, the startup raised $1 million (around Rs 7.5 crore) in pre-seed funding round from Omphalos Ventures India, Nikhil Vora of Sixth Sense Ventures, actor Rannvijay Singh Singha and VG-Angels, among others. The startup was also a part of Y-Combinator’s W22 batch.Share article on",https://www.vccircle.com//91squarefeetbags-10-mn-in-series-a-round,Finance,"Bansal said that in India, there is no direct competition for the startup as of now and that it competes with unorganized contractors and agencies as well as pits against a few big names in certain segments.Without sharing the exact figures, Amit said that the southern market rakes in the most revenues for the Gurugram-headquartered startup, followed by the Western markets of Gujarat and Maharashtra.","['Amit', 'Gurugram']","['$10 million', '$1 million']"

Navi gets nod to go ahead with IPO,13 September,"Sachin Bansal-led Navi Technolgies Ltd’s proposal for an initial public offering (IPO) has been cleared by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi).  The Bengaluru-based firm had filed its draft red herring prospectus in March proposing to raise ₹3,350 crore through its IPO.  The offer will comprise fresh issuance of equity shares to investors.

"Cerebrus, ARCIL withdraw from buying Yes Bank's NPA portfolio",09 September,"Cerebrus Capital and Asset Reconstruction Company Ltd (ARCIL) have dropped out of the race to acquire Yes Bank’s Rs 48,000 crore bad loan portfolio, according to a banker aware of the matter.This comes after ARCIL pulled out of consortium, which finally ended up not submitting a counter bid. Yes Bank had received the counter bid from ARCIL-Cerebrus consortium last month under the Swiss Challenge method after accepting the term sheet from the highest bidder JC Flowers for ₹11,183 crore.A Swiss Challenge gives rivals an opportunity to outdo the winning bidder. If there is such a bid and the winning bidder refuses to match it, the challenger can walk away with the deal. One of the conditions under this method was that the counter offer for the NPA pool can be made only by an ARC and must be at least 5% higher than the anchor bidder to be eligible. According to the transaction, the stressed loans will be sold under the 15:85 structure, with ₹1,800 crore, or 15% of the agreed amount, to be paid upfront in cash to Yes Bank. The rest will be paid in security receipts to be redeemed as the ARC recovers money from defaulters. Yes bank plans to invest up to Rs 350 crore for a 20 per cent stake in JC Flowers ARCFor Cerebrus, this is the second attempt to bid for Yes bank’s NPA portfolio.

ECB lifts rates by unprecedented 75 bps to fight inflation,08 September,"The European Central Bank raised its key interest rates by an unprecedented 75 basis points on Thursday and signalled further hikes, prioritising the fight against inflation even as the bloc's economy is heading for a likely winter recession.With inflation at a half-century high and approaching double-digit territory, policymakers are worried that rapid price growth could become entrenched, eroding the value of household savings and setting off a hard-to-break wage-price spiral.Following up on its July rate hike, the ECB raised its deposit rate to 0.75% from zero and lifted its main refinancing rate to 1.25%, their highest levels since 2011, with further moves anticipated in October and December.""Price pressures have continued to strengthen and broaden across the economy and inflation may rise further in the near term,"" the ECB said in a statement.""This major step frontloads the transition from the prevailing highly accommodative level of policy rates towards levels that will ensure the timely return of inflation to the ECB’s 2% medium-term target,"" the ECB added.Policymakers had for weeks oscillated between a 50 and a 75 basis-point increase, but another jump in both headline and underlying inflation appears to have settled the debate as figures indicate that price growth is now seeping into the broader economy, making it even harder to root out.Indeed, the ECB raised its inflation projections once again, lifting the 2023 outlook to 5.5% from 3.5% and putting the 2024 rate at 2.3%, above its 2% target.Markets were little surprised, however, as investors had already priced a more than 80% likelihood of a 75 basis-point move, even if economists polled by Reuters were more evenly split, showing only a slight majority expecting the larger move.Despite the frontloading, further rate hikes are likely, the ECB said.""Over the next several meetings the Governing Council expects to raise interest rates further to dampen demand and guard against the risk of a persistent upward shift in inflation expectations,"" the ECB added.SERIOUSGoing into the meeting, conservatives feared that anything other than an outsized move would signal that the ECB was not serious about its inflation-fighting mandate - officially its sole objective.That risked pushing up already high long-term inflation expectations, which would signal a loss of confidence in the ECB and raise questions about the bank's inflation-targeting framework.Timid action also risked weakening the euro and boosting inflation further through more expensive energy imports.The euro has been languishing around parity against the dollar for weeks, not far from a two-decade low hit earlier this month.That means more expensive exports of everything from oil to cars, which then raises prices for consumer.Policymakers have also made the case for frontloading rate hikes partly to send a strong signal about the central bank's inflation-fighting commitment and partly to get most of the hikes done before the onset of a recession becomes evident.With high energy prices sapping purchasing power, a downturn is essentially inevitable. However, monetary policy is mostly powerless against a supply-shock driven downturn, firming the argument for hikes even if the economy suffers.Some policymakers are now openly talking about a recession, and the ECB's new projections also show sharply lower growth in the coming years.Still, a shallow recession may even be useful, some argued, as the bloc's labour market is increasingly tight and a downturn could provide relief to firms now struggling to find workers.The bank sees the euro zone economy expanding by 3.1% this year and 0.9% in 2023. While this year's growth projection was lifted a touch, it was lowered sharply for 2023.Attention now turns to ECB President Christine Lagarde's 1245 GMT news conference.Share article on",https://www.vccircle.com//ecblifts-rates-by-unprecedented-75-bps-to-fight-inflation,Finance,"""This major step frontloads the transition from the prevailing highly accommodative level of policy rates towards levels that will ensure the timely return of inflation to the ECB’s 2% medium-term target,"" the ECB added.Policymakers had for weeks oscillated between a 50 and a 75 basis-point increase, but another jump in both headline and underlying inflation appears to have settled the debate as figures indicate that price growth is now seeping into the broader economy, making it even harder to root out.Indeed, the ECB raised its inflation projections once again, lifting the 2023 outlook to 5.5% from 3.5% and putting the 2024 rate at 2.3%, above its 2% target.Markets were little surprised, however, as investors had already priced a more than 80% likelihood of a 75 basis-point move, even if economists polled by Reuters were more evenly split, showing only a slight majority expecting the larger move.Despite the frontloading, further rate hikes are likely, the ECB said.""Over the next several meetings the Governing Council expects to raise interest rates further to dampen demand and guard against the risk of a persistent upward shift in inflation expectations,"" the ECB added.SERIOUSGoing into the meeting, conservatives feared that anything other than an outsized move would signal that the ECB was not serious about its inflation-fighting mandate - officially its sole objective.That risked pushing up already high long-term inflation expectations, which would signal a loss of confidence in the ECB and raise questions about the bank's inflation-targeting framework.Timid action also risked weakening the euro and boosting inflation further through more expensive energy imports.The euro has been languishing around parity against the dollar for weeks, not far from a two-decade low hit earlier this month.That means more expensive exports of everything from oil to cars, which then raises prices for consumer.Policymakers have also made the case for frontloading rate hikes partly to send a strong signal about the central bank's inflation-fighting commitment and partly to get most of the hikes done before the onset of a recession becomes evident.With high energy prices sapping purchasing power, a downturn is essentially inevitable.","['ECB', 'ECB', 'ECB', 'Reuters', 'ECB', 'the Governing Council', 'ECB', 'ECB', 'ECB']",[]

The block trade will be executed on 8 September.InterGlobe Aviation Ltd, which operates IndiGo airline, was founded by businessman Rahul Bhatia and airline veteran Rakesh Gangwal in 2006. A dispute between the two founders became public in July 2019 when Gangwal complained to market regulator SEBI regarding issues related to corporate governance and related-party transactions at IndiGo. The two promoters had also approached the London Court of Arbitration for resolution of the dispute where the final award came on Sep 23. The court had given a period of 90 days to enforce the order. Although the details of the award have not been made public, it is believed to have favoured Gangwal. The feud finally came to an end when the two promoters convened an extraordinary general meeting in December 2021 to remove restrictions on transfer of promoter shares and amend articles of association. The resolution was passed and thereby cleared the path for the promoters to dilute their stake. Within two months, Gangwal announced his resignation from IndiGo board on Feb 18, 2022 with immediate effect. He had further announced that he will “slowly” reduce his equity stake in the airline over a period of more than five years in order to diversify his holdings.“While new investors should benefit from the potential future growth in the company’s share price, a gradual reduction of my stake should also allow me to benefit from some of the upside. Like any plan, future events may impact my current thinking,” Gangwal had said on Feb 18, adding that he shall consider participating as a board member again in the future.  As per July data from Directorate General of Civil Aviation, IndiGo is the largest airline in India with a market share of 58.8%.The airline has recently posted a second straight quarter of net loss at Rs 1,064 crore despite its strongest revenue performance in a quarter at Rs 13,019 crore.

To address this gap and make the pet parents aware about what they put in and on their pets, we have introduced natural products after eight months of extensive research where we use plant derivatives to replace all the harmful chemicals,” said Nishita Agarwal, co-founder of Papa Pawsome. Meanwhile, direct-to-consumer (D2C) startup Toffee Coffee Roasters has raised seed funding of Rs 1 crore from the Indian Angel Network (IAN).

Credai partners with Venture Catalysts to set up proptech fund,07 September,"The Confederation of Real Estate Developers’ Associations of India (Credai) and startup incubator Venture Catalysts have partnered to set up a $100 million fund to invest in proptech startups.The fund will invest in early to growth stage proptech startups leveraging data analytics, blockchain, artificial intelligence and augmented reality. Proptech startups working in segments such as residential, commercial, institutional (hotels, schools, hospitals) and industrial (warehouses and factories) will be backed by the vehicle. Credai will provide startups with access to its network base of 13k+ members from different segments within real estate such as developers, vendors, channel partners, and promoters amongst others. The industry body will also offer mentorship support to portfolio startups. “The real estate was one of the few sectors that witnessed the adoption of technology even before the pandemic hit. However, post-Covid era, this adoption has further increased to boost sales and experience, and hence there is a need for a dedicated fund that would help propel growth in the sector,” said Anuj Golecha, co-founder, Venture Catalysts. “Through this fund, we expect to back interesting and innovative startups in the coming months. Besides, with recent unicorns such as Livspace and NoBroker, the proptech segment has received a massive sentiment from the VC community,” Golecha added. In the past few years, Venture Catalysts has actively invested in companies in the real estate industry. The investor currently has a portfolio of over a dozen startups such as Oyo, Basic, Grexter, Sharenest, Home Capital and Rentomojo, among others.The fund will support the ‘Make in India’ and ‘Techade’ initiatives of the Indian government to work towards the digitalisation of the country’s real estate sector which is estimated at around $300 billion. The sector is expected to cross $1 trillion in value by 2030, according to a report by the Indian Brand Equity Foundation (IBEF). Indian proptech startups are expected to drive exponential growth with innovations in innovative design, logistical advancements, and artificial intelligence-based tech.Golecha, however, pointed out that proptech in India has so far been limited to residential marketplaces such as MagicBricks, NoBroker, 99Acres, and Housing.com, among others. But technology is helping cater to all the important aspects of real estate right from searching for a residential property to helping technology plan large industrial spaces, he added. Investments in the proptech firms are expected to cross $1 billion in 2025, 2x from the 2020 level, according to the 'Real Estate 3.0: Technology-led growth' report by CII and Colliers. In a bid to cash in on the opportunities, investors are making big bets on proptech startups in the country. For instance, Housing.com’s founder Rahul Yadav-led proptech startup Broker Network raised Rs 90 crore from its existing and only backer Info Edge last week. Similarly, in July, Proptech platform Homexchange raised $4 million from HDFC Capital, Oberoi Realty and Anarock Group. Other proptech startups which have raised funds in 2022 are Settlin, Gruhas, PropShare, BuildNext, ﻿Ivy Homes, HouseEazy, and PropReturns, among others. Meanwhile, with the segment coming of age, startups are eyeing going public in near future. Square Yards and Oyo are two such companies that are likely to make their debut on public bourses in the coming months. Share article on",https://www.vccircle.com//credaipartners-with-venture-catalysts-to-set-up-proptech-fund,Finance,"The Confederation of Real Estate Developers’ Associations of India (Credai) and startup incubator Venture Catalysts have partnered to set up a $100 million fund to invest in proptech startups.The fund will invest in early to growth stage proptech startups leveraging data analytics, blockchain, artificial intelligence and augmented reality.The investor currently has a portfolio of over a dozen startups such as Oyo, Basic, Grexter, Sharenest, Home Capital and Rentomojo, among others.The fund will support the ‘Make in India’ and ‘Techade’ initiatives of the Indian government to work towards the digitalisation of the country’s real estate sector which is estimated at around $300 billion.","['The Confederation of Real Estate Developers’ Associations of India', 'Credai', 'Grexter, Sharenest', 'Home Capital and Rentomojo']","['$100 million', 'around $300 billion', '$1 trillion', '$1 billion', '$4 million']"

Tata Digital-owned 1mg raises $40 million in fresh round at unicorn valuation,06 September,"Tata 1mg Technologies Pvt.

The company also provides diagnostics services to customers. In June last year, Tata Digital, a 100% subsidiary of Tata Group holding entity Tata Sons, acquired a majority stake in 1mg. Initially, Tata Digital acquired a 58.7% stake in the company in June 2021 and later increased it to about 63% by December 2021. Tata Digital had acquired 1mg for a cash consideration of Rs 720 crore, Tata Sons revealed in its annual report for financial year 2022 (FY22). Prior to the acquisition, 1mg raised close to $13.3 million from Tata Digital in April 2021.

MobiKwik revenue rises 79% in FY22,02 September,"Digital payments unicorn MobiKwik has clocked ₹540 crore in revenue for the financial year ending March 31, 2022, a nearly 79% increase from the previous fiscal, it said in a press statement on Friday.   The company said it achieved growth with a cash burn of Rs 72.5 crore, all of which was related to the first half as it turned EBITDA positive in the second half of the financial year 2021-22.   Currently, the firm generates revenue primarily from two segments: payments and digital financial services.   MobiKwik did not disclose its profit or loss figures for the financial year. The company had reported a loss of Rs 111.3 crore for FY21, as per its draft prospectus.   ""The most significant milestone was turning EBITDA profitable in the second half, a rarity in the tech world which reflects our ethos of remaining at the forefront of fintech innovation, growing rapidly but with capital efficiency. With business now self-sustaining and the momentum growing, we remain confident of not only achieving our short-term financial goals but also a long-term objective of transforming into a full-service neobank,"" said Upasana Taku, co-founder, MobiKwik.   Mobiwik, which has approval from the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) to float a public issue, posted an 86% rise in total income at ₹396.5 crore in the nine months ended 31 December, up from ₹212.6 crore a year earlier.   The company stated that it witnessed close to 22 million new user additions in FY22, taking its total base of customers to roughly 127 million. Its digital financial services vertical constituted 5% of the FY22 consolidated gross merchandise value (GMV) and 20% of the overall revenue.  “As our digital financial services continue to outpace payments GMV, we expect its salience to overall revenue to only grow with time,"" said Taku.  The payments segment forms 80% of the consolidated revenue with a contribution margin of over 32%. We have remained profitable in this segment over the past 4 years with a steady uptick in margins. “These trends should debunk the questions around profitability in the payments space,” Taku said.  In July 2021, MobiKwik, backed by Sequoia Capital and Bajaj Finance, filed for an initial public offering (IPO) of up to ₹1,900 crore with Sebi. This came days ahead of its larger rival Paytm whose stock corrected post listing last year.

The startup lets users save for large purchases and offers them rewards in form of cashbacks.  The Bengaluru-based startup provides weekly and monthly savings plans ranging from a few months to a year.

However, not all consumers want to or have the capability to pay upfront for large ticket purchases. Besides this, over 93% of Indians do not have access to formal credit.

Supply chain platform Metalbook raises seed funding,29 August,"Digital supply chain platform Metalbook, on Monday announced that it has raised $5 million in seed funding led by Axilor Ventures. Foundamental, RTP Global, Stride Ventures and a few angel investors also participated in the funding round.Metalbook, which recently received its export licence, plans to use the funds to scale to 12 newer geographies, strengthen its global network of processing centres, build the team and enhance its cloud manufacturing platform.Founded in 2021 by Pulkit Baldev, Aman Tibrewal, and Raghavendra Pratap Singh, Metalbook is aiming to digitise the global supply chain for the metal industry.

However, the company has plans to expand its offerings to other metal categories such as Aluminium and Zinc.“Verticalized full-stack platforms are the need of the hour for global supply chains. Metalbook’s platform is helping the iron and steel industry decentralize global supply and demand. With India as the second largest producer of steel, this is a great supply base for the company to start with as it begins global operations.

Fintech platforms in a soup over RBI's stricter lending norms,26 August,"India's stricter digital lending rules have disrupted card services of foreign-backed fintech firms and jeopardised loan offerings of Amazon, prompting companies to chart a lobbying pushback, according to industry sources and a document seen by Reuters.Citing concerns over high rates and unfair practices, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) this month said a loan borrower must deal directly with a bank, dealing a blow to prepaid card providers and shopping websites which act as intermediaries and instantly process deferred loan payments.India's digital lending market has grown quickly and facilitated $2.2 billion in digital loans in 2021-22, with startups attracting foreign backers and giving traditional banks a run for their money in the credit business.The new rules have already hit prepaid card offerings of Tiger Global-backed Slice and Accel-backed startup Uni, which have partnered with banks and allowed users to split purchases into interest-free easy repayments, a feature not available with typical credit cards.Solving ""time-sensitive money crunches"" made Uni popular: its cards were swiped for $67 million on average monthly, much more than credit card usage of some smaller private and public banks in India.The RBI has said the new rules were to be implemented immediately, but added that ""detailed instructions will be issued separately.""Still, Uni suspended its card services this week due to the RBI rules, hitting hundreds of thousands of users, while Slice has put new card issuance on hold.Worries are also rising that the rules will throttle plans of bigger players Amazon.com Inc and Walmart's Flipkart to expand their popular buy-now-pay-later schemes that have tapped millions of users, three industry sources said.That's because currently Amazon and Flipkart facilitate loans for their shoppers. The bank pays the online merchant, while the borrower later makes loan payments to the lender. The new RBI rules, sources say, could impact this route if online merchants can't receive payments directly.""It is likely that seamlessness of availing credit by the customer will be severely impacted,"" the Internet and Mobile Association of India, a top industry group representing Amazon and Flipkart, said in a draft internal lobbying document crafted in collaboration with consulting group PwC.The group plans to push the RBI to carve out direct merchant payments as an exception under the new rules.Flipkart has been bullish on the buy-now-pay-later business, saying in May it doubled its user base for the service to more than 6 million in seven months.Sources said that two other groups representing payment firms and digital lenders also plan to lobby RBI to reconsider some provisions.Slice said in a statement it was committed to comply with Indian regulations, which it said were a recognition of the rapidly growing industry. It did not comment on the business challenges.The RBI, IAMAI and PwC, and none of the other companies responded to Reuters queries.PROTECTING CONSUMERSAmong other new rules, the RBI has said fin-tech firms should recover charges of facilitating a digital loan from their banking partners, not the borrowers. And the firms must also appoint nodal officers and have better checks on user data.Rahul Sasi, a cybersecurity expert who was on an RBI panel that helped draft the new regulations, told Reuters that while some disruption due to the new rules is inevitable, the ultimate aim is to protect consumers.""The idea has been to always let the businesses run, it was not about killing the fin-techs,"" he said.Nevertheless, fin-tech firms are worried, and fear more regulations are on the way. Swapnil Bhaskar, head of strategy at Indian digital banking solutions provider ""Niyo"", said the rules could lead to industry consolidation and slow down an industry that has grown at a rapid pace.The disruptions have disappointed some users.Athul Bhadran, a 28-year-old engineer, said he happily used his Uni prepaid card to manage his budget by splitting his bigger purchases, like the 19,000 rupees ($238) he spent on a washing machine. Now, he can't.""I always had the peace of mind if I wanted to spend a big amount,"" he said.Share article on",https://www.vccircle.com//fintechplatforms-in-a-soup-over-rbi-s-stricter-lending-norms,Finance,"India's stricter digital lending rules have disrupted card services of foreign-backed fintech firms and jeopardised loan offerings of Amazon, prompting companies to chart a lobbying pushback, according to industry sources and a document seen by Reuters.Citing concerns over high rates and unfair practices, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) this month said a loan borrower must deal directly with a bank, dealing a blow to prepaid card providers and shopping websites which act as intermediaries and instantly process deferred loan payments.India's digital lending market has grown quickly and facilitated $2.2 billion in digital loans in 2021-22, with startups attracting foreign backers and giving traditional banks a run for their money in the credit business.The new rules have already hit prepaid card offerings of Tiger Global-backed Slice and Accel-backed startup Uni, which have partnered with banks and allowed users to split purchases into interest-free easy repayments, a feature not available with typical credit cards.Solving ""time-sensitive money crunches"" made Uni popular: its cards were swiped for $67 million on average monthly, much more than credit card usage of some smaller private and public banks in India.The RBI has said the new rules were to be implemented immediately, but added that ""detailed instructions will be issued separately.""It is likely that seamlessness of availing credit by the customer will be severely impacted,"" the Internet and Mobile Association of India, a top industry group representing Amazon and Flipkart, said in a draft internal lobbying document crafted in collaboration with consulting group PwC.The group plans to push the RBI to carve out direct merchant payments as an exception under the new rules.Flipkart has been bullish on the buy-now-pay-later business, saying in May it doubled its user base for the service to more than 6 million in seven months.Sources said that two other groups representing payment firms and digital lenders also plan to lobby RBI to reconsider some provisions.Slice said in a statement it was committed to comply with Indian regulations, which it said were a recognition of the rapidly growing industry.","['Amazon', 'Reuters', 'the Reserve Bank of India', 'RBI', 'Slice and Accel', 'RBI', 'Amazon', 'Flipkart', 'PwC.The', 'RBI', 'RBI']","['$2.2 billion', '$67 million', '238']"

BlackSoil Capital invests $40 million in Q1 FY23 in 6 deals,25 August,"Venture debt and alternative credit platform, BlackSoil Capital, Thursday said it has invested more than $40 million in six deals over the first quarter of FY23. “BlackSoil invested $40 million in over 6 deals in Q1FY23, posting the highest ever year-on-year (YoY) growth of 4x times, despite the broader cyclical volatility, and uncertainty associated with rising and fall in COVID numbers,” the company said in a press release.BlackSoil also noted that its venture debt deals have crossed the $300 million landmark.

We continue to remain bullish on Venture Debt as the ideal alternative to equity in the current market scenario.

NDTV promoters say Sebi nod required for Adani to acquire shares,25 August,"NDTV on Thursday argued that Adani Group firms cannot yet acquire a stake in the television channel’s parent entity, citing a November 2020 ruling by the markets regulator which barred the NDTV founders from accessing capital markets for two years in a case of insider trading. Adani group firms would need to secure a Securities Exchange Board of India (Sebi) approval to acquire shares in promoter entity Vishvapradhan Commercial Private Limited (VCPL), NDTV  claimed in a regulatory filing on Thursday morning.      The Roys were prohibited from accessing the securities market in any manner for a period of two years till November 26, 2022, because a  SEBI order restrained ""the Founder-Promoters Dr. Prannoy Roy and Mrs. Radhika Roy from accessing the securities market, and further prohibiting buying, selling, or otherwise dealing in securities, directly or indirectly, or being associated with the securities market in any manner whatsoever for a period of 2 years.”   As a result, NDTV has reasoned that Adani cannot yet acquire 99.5% stake in VCPL as this will also lead to the acquisition of voting rights equivalent to 29.18% stake in NDTV, through RRPR Holdings.  RRPR Holdings is owned by Radhika Roy and Prannoy Roy.  On August 23, Adani Group companies said they had acquired the stake in NDTV indirectly by buying VCPL, which owned convertible debentures (warrants that provide for the conversion of debt to equity) in RRPR Holding Pvt. Ltd that in turn owned 29.18% of NDTV Ltd. Vishvapradhan acquired the debentures in 2009-10 in return for a loan amounting to  ₹404 crore it extended to the promoter holding company.   Following this, Adani Group and Vishvapradhan  announced an open offer at  ₹294 per share (based on Sebi’s takeover guidelines), representing a 28% discount to NDTV’s ₹376 closing price on Tuesday.  NDTV immediately protested the move and said that "" this exercise of rights by VCPL was executed without any input from, conversation with, or consent of the NDTV founders.”   In November 2020, Sebi had investigated two separate cases against promoters of NDTV. While one involved loans taken by promoters of NDTV from Vishvapradhan Commercial Pvt. Ltd, the other included a case of insider trading.   In both of these orders Sebi had imposed a ban of two years on the promoters. They were restrained from accessing the capital markets. SAT on 20 July this year had overruled the ban in the VCPL loan case stating that the findings and directions are not sustainable.   However, the order in the case of insider trading is still in appeal at SAT.   The matter pertains to Sebi findings that Prannoy Roy and Radhika Roy indulged in insider trading in the scrip of NDTV between September 1 2006 to 30 June 2008.   During this period NDTV underwent a reorganisation exercise to unlock shareholder value and promote focused growth of its various businesses. It involved demerger and splitting the company into two verticals ‘news related business’ and ‘beyond news’.   Sebi alleged that the Roys had together bought 48,35,850 shares of NDTV on 26 December December 2007, for a value of Rs 19,34,34,000. By dealing in shares of NDTV while in possession of unpublished price sensitive information (UPSI) the Roys have violated the provisions of insider trading, said the market regulator in its order on 26 November 2022. Share article on",https://www.vccircle.com//ndtvpromoters-say-sebi-nod-required-for-adani-to-acquire-shares,Finance,"NDTV on Thursday argued that Adani Group firms cannot yet acquire a stake in the television channel’s parent entity, citing a November 2020 ruling by the markets regulator which barred the NDTV founders from accessing capital markets for two years in a case of insider trading.The Roys were prohibited from accessing the securities market in any manner for a period of two years till November 26, 2022, because a  SEBI order restrained ""the Founder-Promoters Dr. Prannoy Roy and Mrs. Radhika Roy from accessing the securities market, and further prohibiting buying, selling, or otherwise dealing in securities, directly or indirectly, or being associated with the securities market in any manner whatsoever for a period of 2 years.”   As a result, NDTV has reasoned that Adani cannot yet acquire 99.5% stake in VCPL as this will also lead to the acquisition of voting rights equivalent to 29.18% stake in NDTV, through RRPR Holdings.","['Adani Group', 'NDTV', 'Founder-Promoters Dr.', 'NDTV', 'Adani', 'VCPL', 'NDTV', 'RRPR Holdings']","['404', '294']"

It claims that it helps brands plan, research and create content in one-fifth the time it normally takes and reduces costs by 90%.  “The pandemic spurred rapid digitization across businesses, with a greater emphasis being placed on digital marketing,” said Scalenut’s co-founder Mayank Jain. He pointed out that after spending a huge amount of money on paid advertising for growth, brands have now realised that it is not sustainable in the long run and therefore, there has been an increased focus on organic marketing to grow sustainably.“In order to increase organic growth, SEO and content marketing teams juggle multiple tools for sound SEO research, content creation, optimization, and performance measurement. Not only is it inefficient, but it also leads to siloed team efforts based on broken insights and incomplete strategy. This is why most businesses struggle to scale content marketing successfully,” he added. “With Scalenut, we aim to empower the SEO and content teams to put the paddle on their organic marketing efforts from a single platform and help businesses grow sustainably,” said Jain.In the AI content space, Scalenut competes against the likes of Copy.ai, Heyday AI and Copysmith. However, it claims that it takes care of the entire content lifecycle, including content planning, research, writing and SEO optimization, unlike its competitors.Share article on",https://www.vccircle.com//saasplatform-scalenut-raises-funds-from-saama-capital-others,Finance,"He pointed out that after spending a huge amount of money on paid advertising for growth, brands have now realised that it is not sustainable in the long run and therefore, there has been an increased focus on organic marketing to grow sustainably.“In order to increase organic growth, SEO and content marketing teams juggle multiple tools for sound SEO research, content creation, optimization, and performance measurement.“With Scalenut, we aim to empower the SEO and content teams to put the paddle on their organic marketing efforts from a single platform and help businesses grow sustainably,” said Jain.In the AI content space, Scalenut competes against the likes of Copy.ai, Heyday AI and Copysmith.",['AI'],"['$3.1 million', '400,000']"

FIIs steer back towards Indian equity after major sell-off in H1FY23,23 August,"Foreigners are returning to Indian stocks after dumping them in the first half as they look for higher returns amid expectations that major central banks will slow their hiking cycles as price pressures ease.Fears of an economic recession have lifted hopes that central banks will dial back or even halt the rate hikes to avert a slowdown. US Fed officials indicated in the minutes of their July meeting released last week that they would adopt a less aggressive stance if inflation starts to recede.According to stock exchange data, foreigners have invested $6.4 billion in Indian equities since the start of July, after dumping over $27 billion-worth over the previous six months.Domestic investors bought over $30 billion worth of stocks in the first half, helping to prop up the market. But this month, overseas investors have taken the baton, pouring in over $5 billion on hopes that Indian companies will deliver stronger earnings and that a fall in crude oil prices will help narrow the country's current account deficit.Analysts also expect the return of foreign money into Indian equity and bond markets to help the rupee find some reprieve, after slumping over 6.7% against the dollar this year.Since mid-June, India's major stock index has surged 11.5%, which compares with the MSCI World index's gain of 6%, and MSCI Emerging Market index's decline of 2.8%.""Foreigners clearly underestimated how India would tackle the pandemic and the economic recovery post-pandemic has been robust in an uncertain global environment,"" said Neha Pathak, investment specialist for India Equities at BNP Paribas Asset Management.""With well-developed and robust equity markets, which have delivered great returns, Indian equities will be hard to ignore for any global investor.""Despite a lacklustre earnings performance in the June quarter, several companies have expressed confidence that a drop in commodity prices will bolster their margins in upcoming quarters.Top companies like Hindustan Unilever and Tata Motors flagged in recent reports that falling commodity prices from red-hot levels will aid margin improvement in coming quarters.Aishvarya Dadheech, fund manager at Ambit Asset Management, said Indian equities would be bolstered by a strong earnings momentum and moderating inflation.""Earnings growth is going to be much better compared to other emerging markets. So, the deep cuts from FII (foreign institutional investors) ownership will reverse from here.""According to Refinitiv data, India's large and mid-cap companies' net profits are expected to grow by 18.9% in 2023, the highest in Asia.Some overseas fund managers are also diverting money from China, where shares have been hit by an economic slowdown, fresh Covid-19 flare-ups and a crisis in the property sector.According to a BofA Global Research report, emerging market funds' allocation to India increased to 19.7% in July from 18.1% in June, while the allocation to China dropped to 36.2% from 39.4%.With China and rest of the world looking at growth challenges, India stands out having better earnings and GDP expectations, said Amit Sachdeva, research analyst at HSBC.The rupee has also performed better than some of its emerging market counterparts recently. Over the past month, the rupee has dropped just 0.03%, while China's yuan, South Africa's rand and Malaysia's ringgit slumped 1.43%, 0.92%, and 0.74% respectively.Morgan Stanley expects Asian economies such as India and Indonesia, which are focused on domestic demand, to be more resilient than those dependent on exports, as slowing demand from developed countries affects shipments.""We continue to be constructive on India, Indonesia, and the Philippines as they are well placed to generate domestic demand alpha,"" the brokerage said.DOMESTIC INVESTMENTS DROPAt the same time, domestic investors in India trimmed their positions in August, lured by a rise in bank deposit rates which provide them with risk-free money.The data showed domestic investors have sold $773 million in Indian equities so far this month.However, some analysts said slowing domestic investments could just be a blip. According to the BofA report, domestic investments through systematic investment plans (SIPs), in which investors put in money each month, remain robust.

Rivigo kicks off Series H round for funding,23 August,"Trucking logistics firm Rivigo raised Rs 16 crore (around $2 million) in a Series H round led by existing investors Elevation Capital and Warburg Pincus affiliate Spring Canter Investment. The Gurugram-based company raised about Rs 8 crore each from Elevation Capital and Spring Canter Investment Limited by issuing 11,840 Series H compulsorily convertible preference shares to both VCs, according to a regulatory filing seen by VCCircle.  Queries sent to Rivigo remained unanswered till the time of publishing. Prior to this, the company had raised Rs 84.4 crore in its Series G funding round from Elevation Capital. In total, the company has raised close to $270 million in multiple equity and debt financing rounds.  Founded in 2014 by IIT Kanpur graduate Deepak Garg and Stanford alumnus Gazal Kalra, Rivigo provides pan-India logistics services to e-commerce, pharmaceuticals, automobiles, cold-chain, and FMCG companies.The logistics firm became the eighth Indian startup to become a unicorn, a privately held company with a valuation of $1 billion or more, in 2019. The company also counts South Korea’s KB Platform Fund as its backer.  In May 2022, Rivigo’s chief executive officer Garg said that the company was planning to raise $50-100 million in a pre-IPO (initial public listing) round in 2022, with plans of making a public debut in 2024.Rivigo has switched from an asset-heavy to an asset-light approach in the past two years in order to achieve scalability and cut losses.

Byju's to settle Blackstone dues for Akash deal in Sept,23 August,"Edtech unicorn Byju’s is likely to settle dues of $180 million to Aakash Educational Services shareholder Blackstone Inc. by September-end, two people in the know said.Byju’s had agreed to acquire Aakash Educational Services in April 2021 in a $950-million cash and stock deal, and made partial payments to its shareholders. In all, Blackstone was to receive $400 million.“Around $220 million has been paid to Blackstone, with $180 million pending,” one of the people said, seeking anonymity. In June, both parties had mutually agreed on a two-month extension.The payments were earlier scheduled to be closed by the end of August, a Byju’s spokesperson said on 5 July. Back then, Byju’s said in a statement that payments to Aakash had been closed. Mint wrote on 12 July, that Byju’s had time till August end to pay Blackstone.However, subsequently, the deadline was renegotiated to September-end, they added.“The transaction continues to be on track and is in final stages. Blackstone is expecting the final tranche within the next 4-5 weeks as per schedule,” the second person said also requesting anonymity.The three parties have separately filed documents before the National Company Law Tribunal for merging AESL with Think and Learn Pvt. Ltd, the parent of Byju’s. “It is in the process according to government guidelines and process,” a third person familiar with the development said.Blackstone will also receive additional shares amounting to 0.75-1% in Byju’s after the merger process is approved by the NCLT, as reported by Mint on 6 July. Blackstone’s Strategic Opportunities Fund owns an unspecified stake in Byju’s, having invested in the company separately in June 2021 as part of a nearly $340-million funding round.Byju’s is valued by its shareholders at about $23 billion. It has so far raised nearly $6 billion from more than 70 investors, including General Atlantic, Sequoia Capital, Sofina and CPPIB.

"Investors press sell button amid rate hike fears, geopolitical tensions",22 August,"Indian benchmarks Nifty and Sensex fell a percent and a half each as investors booked profits from four-month highs amid a stronger dollar , mounting growth concerns on anticipations that US Fed policymakers would sound a hawkish tone at an economic symposium later this week and escalation between Washington and Beijing over Taiwan.The stock correction, which left investors poorer by Rs 3.9 lakh crore, was led by indices like the Nifty, which fell 268 points to 17490.7 and Sensex, which plunged 872 points to 58773.87. The rupee fell 8 paise to 79.86/USD while the Dow Jones traded 1.2% lower at opening, signalling a global risk-off.The Bank Nifty was among the worst performing, correcting 688 points or almost 2% to 38298. Tata Steel, Asian Paints, Adani Ports, Tata Motors and JSW Steel were the top index losers, shedding 3-4.5%.FIIs turned sellers for the first time this month, offloading shares worth a provisional Rs 454 crore as per BSE data. So far through August 19, they had purchased shares worth Rs 46000 crore. In the fiscal year through August 19 (FY23) they have net sold shares worth Rs 56338 crore.“Consolidation was triggered in the market in anticipation of tighter monetary policy by the FED and worries over a slowdown in global economic activity,” said Vinod Nair, research head, Geojit Financial Services.  “The current risk reward is not favouring investors as the Nifty50 is now trading at a premium valuation of 21.5x P/E (1yr fwd basis), above the long-term average. Rising dollar index and higher US10 year bond yield act as the near-term headwinds for the market.”Monday’s correction was the second straight loss after Friday when the Nifty corrected after falling just 8 points shy of 18000. Market mavens remain mixed on the prospects from here on. While some expect a consolidation within a narrow range until a fresh breakout or breakdown, others believe that the trend has reversed after a 17% rally from the mid-June low of 15183 to 17992 on August 19.  “Leading indicators like RSI showed we were overbought and a correction was due after the sharp rally,” Palviya said, adding, “The correction could extend to 17300 after which the market could consolidate between that level and 17800.”However, technical experts like Rohit Srivastava of IndiaCharts expect the correction to have signalled a “trend reversal.” He expects markets could test the 15183 low of June over the next couple months.“Seldom have we seen an over 80% retracement of the fall; it didn’t happen during the 2008 market crash either,” Srivastava said, citing the correction from the record high of 18604 on October 19 last year through 15183 on June 17 this year and the subsequent rally to the high of 17992 on August 19, being an over 80% retracement of the fall from October to June.Apart from the Nifty not being able to break the 18000 psychological mark, the inability of the broader Nifty 500 to break above its January high of 15795 and April high of 15478 also signalled that a correction was in the offing.Share article on",https://www.vccircle.com//investorspress-sell-button-amid-rate-hike-fears-geopolitical-tensions,Finance,"Indian benchmarks Nifty and Sensex fell a percent and a half each as investors booked profits from four-month highs amid a stronger dollar , mounting growth concerns on anticipations that US Fed policymakers would sound a hawkish tone at an economic symposium later this week and escalation between Washington and Beijing over Taiwan.The stock correction, which left investors poorer by Rs 3.9 lakh crore, was led by indices like the Nifty, which fell 268 points to 17490.7 and Sensex, which plunged 872 points to 58773.87.“Leading indicators like RSI showed we were overbought and a correction was due after the sharp rally,” Palviya said, adding, “The correction could extend to 17300 after which the market could consolidate between that level and 17800.”However, technical experts like Rohit Srivastava of IndiaCharts expect the correction to have signalled a “trend reversal.” He expects markets could test the 15183 low of June over the next couple months.“Seldom have we seen an over 80% retracement of the fall; it didn’t happen during the 2008 market crash either,” Srivastava said, citing the correction from the record high of 18604 on October 19 last year through 15183 on June 17 this year and the subsequent rally to the high of 17992 on August 19, being an over 80% retracement of the fall from October to June.Apart from the Nifty not being able to break the 18000 psychological mark, the inability of the broader Nifty 500 to break above its January high of 15795 and April high of 15478 also signalled that a correction was in the offing.Share article on","['Nifty', 'US Fed', 'Nifty', 'Sensex', 'RSI', 'Palviya', 'IndiaCharts', 'Nifty']",[]

"PharmEasy's parent firm withdraws IPO papers, plans to raise funds via rights issue",21 August,"PharmEasy’s parent company, API Holdings Ltd, has withdrawn the draft red herring prospectus (DRHP) it filed with the Securities and Exchange Board of India to float its initial public offering (IPO). The company had filed the DRHP on 9 November 2021.PharmEasy deferred its IPO plans citing market conditions and strategic considerations, it said in a notice. The company is now instead planning to raise funds from existing shareholders via a rights issue. The issue will comprise compulsory convertible preference shares expected to be priced around Rs 100 apiece. According to the notice, the company will open the rights issue for 30 days, starting around the first week of September 2022. The company, which offers medicine deliveries and diagnostic test services, counts Prosus, TPG and Temasek as investors. ""Shareholders of the company will receive the letter of offer inviting them to participate in the rights issue on the terms which will be approved by the board,"" the company said in the notice. In its DRHP, API Holdings had mentioned that the company was intending to raise Rs 6,250 crore via IPO. With the funds, the company was planning to majorly prepay or repay debt, fuel organic growth initiatives, and fund inorganic growth via acquisitions. The company had hired Kotak Mahindra Capital Company Ltd, Morgan Stanley India Company Private Ltd, BoFA Securities India Limited, Citigroup Global Markets India Private Ltd, and JM Financial Ltd as bankers for its IPO.Last month, Reuters, citing two people close to the matter, reported that the medical services startup was in talks with investors to raise $200 million in a down round valuing the company 15% or even 25% lower than last year's $5.1 billion. The volatile domestic and international stock markets and growing investor scepticism about the high valuations of Indian startups have led to the fall in share prices of public Indian tech companies. For instance, on 19 August, Paytm shares closed at Rs 771 apiece, down 64% from the IPO level of Rs 2,150. In the recently concluded annual general meeting, Paytm’s chief executive officer Vijay Shekhar Sharma told shareholders that his employee stock option plan grant will not vest until the price does not cross the IPO mark of Rs 2,150. Share article on",https://www.vccircle.com//pharmeasys-parent-firm-withdraws-ipo-papers-plans-to-raise-funds-via-rights-issue,Finance,"""Shareholders of the company will receive the letter of offer inviting them to participate in the rights issue on the terms which will be approved by the board,"" the company said in the notice.The company had hired Kotak Mahindra Capital Company Ltd, Morgan Stanley India Company Private Ltd, BoFA Securities India Limited, Citigroup Global Markets India Private Ltd, and JM Financial Ltd as bankers for its IPO.Last month, Reuters, citing two people close to the matter, reported that the medical services startup was in talks with investors to raise $200 million in a down round valuing the company 15% or even 25% lower than last year's $5.1 billion.","['Kotak Mahindra Capital Company Ltd', 'Morgan Stanley India Company Private Ltd', 'BoFA Securities India Limited', 'Citigroup Global Markets India Private Ltd', 'JM Financial Ltd', 'Reuters']","['$200 million', '$5.1 billion']"
"Paytm says will achieve profitability by September 2023, denies international expansion",19 August,"Financial services conglomerate Paytm has no plans to expand internationally or make any acquisitions, the company management told shareholders on Friday, even as it reiterated its plan to turn operationally profitable by September-end 2023.Speaking at the company’s first annual general meeting, Paytm managing director and chief executive officer Vijay Shekhar Sharma answered questions on the company’s depressed stock price, when the company’s shares will reach the issue price of Rs 2,150, and when it will achieve profitability.“There is a difference between a small company becoming profitable and a big company becoming profitable. Our ambition is to be a large-scale company and become profitable,” Sharma said, speaking largely in Hindi, in his response to shareholder questions on profitability timeline. Paytm’s losses widened to Rs 644 crore in the first quarter of FY23 from Rs 380.2 crore in the corresponding quarter last year, although its revenue increased over 86% for the same period. Paytm shares closed at Rs 771.85 on Friday, recovering 4.66% over the last month.Sharma said the company was on track to becoming profitable by September 2023. “Till 2019, the company was focused on expansion, after which it focused on monetization through its payments and lending divisions,” Sharma said. He attributed the depressed share price to poor investor sentiment and macroeconomic factors, adding the company did not have any influence in managing the stock beyond its focus on profits.“From the shareholders’ letter, we see that the definition of profitability has been modified. We do not support companies redefining how profitability is determined to suit individual needs,” Hetal Dalal, president & chief operating officer, of Institutional Investor Advisory Services (IiAS) said.In a shareholder letter earlier this year, Sharma had said the company would aim to achieve operational profitability, which he defined as Ebitda before Esop costs. Ebitda is short for earnings before interest, tax and amortization and Esop stands for employee stock options.Sharma obliquely addressed concerns over his remuneration by reiterating that his stock options that were granted in FY22 will not vest till the company hits the IPO market cap. Sharma’s remuneration of Rs 796 crore including stock options granted in FY22 was one of the resolutions put up for vote ahead of the AGM. Proxy advisory firms have questioned the grant of Esops to Sharma, since he is practically a permanent director on the board, and in light of Paytm stock’s abysmal performance.Sharma is not classified as a promoter, but he is the founder of Paytm, owing close to 14% stock in the company including through his family trust.Sharma said the company did not want the distraction of expanding abroad, although he noted that Paytm was already in Japan through its investment in Softbank-backed PayPay.“We don’t have plans to expand internationally in the short and mid-term. We want to stay focused on achieving profitability and gaining revenue. There is a lot of market to grow in payments and in credit in India. We don’t want any distraction,” Sharma said, adding that the company may think about international expansion in two or three years.Group chief financial officer Madhur Deora said there were no plans to make any acquisitions in the short and medium term.“We are more builders than buyers,” Deora said, noting that it was easier for the company to build for huge scale than acquiring it.Ahead of the AGM, shareholders voted on five ordinary resolutions on adoption of the financial statements of FY22, reappointment of Sharma as MD and CEO; and the reappointment of Deora as group CFO, president and executive director; reappointment of Ravi Adusumilli to the board; contributions to charitable entities; and two special resolutions on the remunerations of Sharma and Deora. The company did not disclose voting results till press time.While Alibaba group owns close to 25% stake in the company, Paytm also has other investors such as Softbank, Elevation Capital and CPPIB. Sharma owns close to 9% stake in Paytm, and another 5% through a family trust.Three proxy advisory firms had advised investors to vote against the reappointment of Sharma and Adusumilli, while raising concerns over management compensation.“Vijay Shekhar Sharma has embedded himself into the company through the company’s Articles of Association – he has board nomination rights even if he gets diluted by more than 50% from his current 8.9% equity stake, as long has he either holds an executive position or 3.1 million shares aggregating not less than 2.5% of the Paytm’s paid-up share capital. He is also not liable to retire by rotation, which makes him effectively a permanent director. How then, is he any different from a promoter? And to this extent, giving him stock options is not aligned to the regulatory thinking – Indian regulations do not allow promoters to be granted stock options,” Dalal of IiAS said.Share article on",https://www.vccircle.com//focusis-on-achieving-profitability-don-t-want-any-distractions-of-international-expansion-paytm-s-sharma-said,Finance,"Proxy advisory firms have questioned the grant of Esops to Sharma, since he is practically a permanent director on the board, and in light of Paytm stock’s abysmal performance.Sharma is not classified as a promoter, but he is the founder of Paytm, owing close to 14% stock in the company including through his family trust.Sharma said the company did not want the distraction of expanding abroad, although he noted that Paytm was already in Japan through its investment in Softbank-backed PayPay.“We don’t have plans to expand internationally in the short and mid-term.We don’t want any distraction,” Sharma said, adding that the company may think about international expansion in two or three years.Group chief financial officer Madhur Deora said there were no plans to make any acquisitions in the short and medium term.“We are more builders than buyers,” Deora said, noting that it was easier for the company to build for huge scale than acquiring it.Ahead of the AGM, shareholders voted on five ordinary resolutions on adoption of the financial statements of FY22, reappointment of Sharma as MD and CEO; and the reappointment of Deora as group CFO, president and executive director; reappointment of Ravi Adusumilli to the board; contributions to charitable entities; and two special resolutions on the remunerations of Sharma and Deora.","['Esops', 'Paytm', 'Softbank', 'PayPay', 'AGM', 'CFO']",[]

Edtech company Sunstone bags $35 million in Series C,19 August,"Edtech startup Sunstone Education Technology Pvt. Ltd, on Friday announced it has raised $35 million in its Series C funding round led by WestBridge Capital. Alteria Capital also participated in the round.  Sunstone is planning to utilize the fresh funds to expand its presence from the current 35+ cities to 100 cities across India. The company will also use the funds to expand into new programmes, with a focus on undergraduate tech programmes, it said in a release.   Founded by Ashish Munjal and Piyush Nangru in 2019, Sunstone offers a hybrid learning model for a slew of higher education courses such as Master of Business Administration, Bachelor of Technology, and Bachelors of Business Administration, etc.  Sunstone started with post-graduate management education courses, and eventually ventured into undergraduate programs in 2022. The company claims that it registered a 10 times growth in the past two years.  “The Indian higher education system is at the brink of an overdue transformation. Sunstone is well positioned to enable this change…we have made significant strides in the direction but still have a long way to go as the market opportunity and problem we’re trying to solve for, is very large,” said Ashish Munjal, co-founder and chief executive officer, Sunstone.  Sunstone last raised $28 million in Series B funding in October last year. At that time too, WestBridge Capital had led the funding, with participation from three existing investors: Saama Capital, Alteria Capital and Work10m. “Seeing the ever-increasing demand and Sunstone’s potential to be a major disruptor, we are excited to double down our investment to support its mission of transforming the higher education sector in India,” said Sandeep Singhal, managing partner, WestBridge Capital.   Sunstone’s Series C funding round comes at a time when edtech platforms are facing troubles in raising fresh moolah as physical education and learning returned offline with ease in Covid-19 cases.  The dearth of funding in 2022 follows two golden years for edtech startups. In 2021, investors pumped $4.7 billion into edtech platforms while 2020 saw startups raising about $2.2 billion.  In comparison, funding for edtech startups declined by 50% in the April to June quarter of 2022, according to a PricewaterhouseCoopers report released last month. Share article on",https://www.vccircle.com//edtechcompany-sunstone-bags-35-million-in-series-c,Finance,"Sunstone is well positioned to enable this change…we have made significant strides in the direction but still have a long way to go as the market opportunity and problem we’re trying to solve for, is very large,” said Ashish Munjal, co-founder and chief executive officer, Sunstone.“Seeing the ever-increasing demand and Sunstone’s potential to be a major disruptor, we are excited to double down our investment to support its mission of transforming the higher education sector in India,” said Sandeep Singhal, managing partner, WestBridge Capital.","['Ashish Munjal', 'WestBridge Capital']","['$35 million', '$28 million', '$4.7 billion', 'about $2.2 billion']"

SEBI waives need for ‘Indian connect' for VC/PE funds' overseas investments ,18 August,"The Securities Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has relaxed two norms governing overseas investments of Indian private equity and venture capital funds, thereby expanding the scope of the capital that can be invested abroad.First, it has allowed Indian private equity and venture capital funds to invest in overseas companies even if they do not have an Indian connect, according to a filing.Till now, PE or VC funds under SEBI’s Alternative Investment Funds (AIF) regime could only invest in overseas companies which had an Indian connect by way of a subsidiary, following a circular issued on 5 October, 2015.That requirement has been done away with through the latest circular issued on August 17.  Second, SEBI has said the principal proceeds from the sale of an overseas security held by an Indian AIF shall become available to all AIFs for re-investment.  Indian AIFs can collectively only invest $1.5 billion in overseas entities, which was also capped at 25% of the individual fund’s corpus.  This cap was breached last month, causing angst within the AIF community, as VCCircle reported on 8 July. Some funds said this was making them less competitive compared to global peers. However, RBI has been reluctant to raise the cap to avoid weakening the rupee.While the cap has not been lifted,  by allowing for reinvestments, funds will get greater use from the allowed $1.5 billion limit, as mandated by the RBI.  This means, if a fund invested $10 million overseas in a startup which it has now exited, the $10 million is now available for use once again. “The recycling of the principal invested overseas into the overall allowance will extend the longevity of said allowance. These moves by SEBI will make Indian AIFs more attractive to investors, global and Indian, and will further fuel the growth of the AIF industry,” said Siddarth Pai, co-chair - Regulatory Affairs Committee, IVCA and founding partner, 3one4 Capital. ""The recent changes by SEBI to the overseas investment framework eases the process considerably by liberalizing it as well as addressing longstanding concerns of the industry. The removal of the 'India connect' allows Indian AIFs to go global in their stock selection and bring geographical diversity to their investment thesis,” Pai added.Share article on",https://www.vccircle.com//sebiwaives-need-for-indian-connect-for-vc-pe-funds-overseas-investments-,Finance,"The Securities Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has relaxed two norms governing overseas investments of Indian private equity and venture capital funds, thereby expanding the scope of the capital that can be invested abroad.First, it has allowed Indian private equity and venture capital funds to invest in overseas companies even if they do not have an Indian connect, according to a filing.Till now, PE or VC funds under SEBI’s Alternative Investment Funds (AIF) regime could only invest in overseas companies which had an Indian connect by way of a subsidiary, following a circular issued on 5 October, 2015.That requirement has been done away with through the latest circular issued on August 17.However, RBI has been reluctant to raise the cap to avoid weakening the rupee.While the cap has not been lifted,  by allowing for reinvestments, funds will get greater use from the allowed $1.5 billion limit, as mandated by the RBI.","['The Securities Exchange Board of India', 'SEBI’s Alternative Investment Funds', 'AIF', 'RBI', 'RBI']","['$1.5 billion', '$1.5 billion', '$10 million', '$10 million']"
Fintech profitability doubtful in next 2-3 years: report,18 August,"More than 70% of respondents believe most fintech companies may not be profitable in the next 2-3 years, owing to an increased focus on the scale as opposed to profitability and compliance, a report published by Matrix Partners with Boston Consulting Group (BCG) said.However, 30% of respondents believe fintechs will be profitable in the next 2-3 years. For 32%, payment technology had a positive outlook, while 82% believed that product expansion was the highest priority among the fintech companies.On the contrary, internal controls, cost reduction and fundraising remained to be the bottom three priorities.The report further said that fintech companies needed to pay more attention to governance. Once the scale is achieved, fintech companies may outgrow advisers and over a period, it may be advisable to get independent directors on the board.Fintech companies need to proactively report their governance practices and initiatives to break the myth and perception of poor governance, and garner trust, both from customers as well as regulators.  “Once the scale is achieved, fintech companies should outgrow advisors, and get an NBFC license,” one of the survey respondents said.Equity funding into Indian fintech companies has grown at a CAGR (compound annual growth rate) of 26% over the last 4 years, but more rapidly so from 2020 onwards, fuelled by the post-pandemic impact of high growth via increased digital services adoption. The increasing number of late-stage financing rounds is another indicator of the increased maturity of Indian fintech companies.The report includes results from a survey of over 125 founders and senior management at Indian fintech firms.   Many large fintech platforms had started operations in 2008, with neobanks being the recent entrants. While the number of fintechs scaled up between 2014 and 2021, funding was low till 2015 after which the sector received a rapid funding boost.   The pandemic further boosted the payments space, leading to a 210% spike in funding between the current year 2020 and 2021.    Yashraj Erande, managing director and partner at BCG said, “36% of fintech customers are new-to-credit, vs 22% for Banks. “Fin” in FinTech is acquiring a bigger font. This means a greater focus on profitability and governance. Relentless focus on innovation and customers made fintechs successful. This should continue. Nonetheless, new muscle needs to be added for newer priorities. ‘Growing together in partnership with incumbents and private innovation on public utilities will be key moats.”    Respondents said that cards and unsecured lending are the top choices as areas to be disrupted. Over 50% of respondents believed asset quality, CAC (customer acquisition cost) and regulations are top challenges to sustainability with the meaningful scale being a barrier on the path to building a profitable lending business.The report noted that 14% of companies improved growth and margin in downturns, while 44% declined in both. With 150 deals/quarter and $9.8 billion funding in 2021, the momentum has remained strong. However, the last few quarters have seen multiple shifts, largely owing to macroeconomic conditions, mostly from the impending possibility of a recession and high inflation globally.  Share article on",https://www.vccircle.com//fintechprofitability-doubtful-in-next-2-3-years-report,Finance,"More than 70% of respondents believe most fintech companies may not be profitable in the next 2-3 years, owing to an increased focus on the scale as opposed to profitability and compliance, a report published by Matrix Partners with Boston Consulting Group (BCG) said.However, 30% of respondents believe fintechs will be profitable in the next 2-3 years.Once the scale is achieved, fintech companies may outgrow advisers and over a period, it may be advisable to get independent directors on the board.Fintech companies need to proactively report their governance practices and initiatives to break the myth and perception of poor governance, and garner trust, both from customers as well as regulators.","['Matrix Partners', 'Boston Consulting Group', 'BCG']",['$9.8 billion']

Lending platform Abhi Loans raises fresh funding,18 August,"KNAB Finance Advisors Pvt. Ltd, a non-banking financial company has raised $4.5 million (around Rs 35.5 crore) in a mixture of debt and equity for its digital lending platform, Abhi Loans led by DMI Sparkle Fund and with participation from angel investors Niten Malhan, Ashvin Chadha and SK Jain.The fresh funds will be used to develop the technological growth of the loan book. KNAB Finance is building a digitally distributed and secure loan ecosystem with its product Abhi Loans. Founded by Deepit Singh and Mandeep Chaudhary, KNAB Finance is building a digitally distributed and secure loan ecosystem with Abhi Loans and is entering the market with loans against shares and mutual funds. The company says the lending products it offers are available earlier in the market only as high-value loan offerings for high networth individuals.   Abhi Loans provides capital to borrowers within 24 hours and any delay in reimbursement of the loan amount entitles the latter to a 50% waiver on the processing fee. The rate of interest is fixed at 10.5% per annum throughout the loan tenure, the company claims.   “One method to save money on several high-interest loans, for instance, is to monetize the small mutual fund portfolios we have. Starting with a small loan amount of as low as Rs 15,000, any retail customer with a unit balance of Rs 20,000 can take a cheap loan and also opt for low-interest debt consolidation. It reduces the interest burden in the long run and makes repayment much easier,” said Mandeep Chaudhary, founder, Abhi Loans. The Sparkle Fund is an alternative investment fund (AIF) of the DMI Group, launched in 2017 it primarily backs early-stage startups and fintech companies.

GIC adds stake in auto ancillary Sona BLW; Blackstone makes partial exit,18 August,"Private equity major Blackstone sold a partial stake in listed auto ancillary, Sona BLW Precision in multiple block deals on stock exchanges, Thursday morning. Sona BLW Precision’s shares traded with cuts of 3.4% at around Rs 521 apiece on the National Stock Exchange during Thursday’s opening trade. The $500 million book was oversubscribed, according to a person in the know. Singapore's sovereign fund GIC subscribed to the deal alongside other investors and mutual funds such as SBI MF, Nippon MF, Kotak MF, HDFC MF, Nomura asset management, Eastspring Investments, and Manulife. Mint had reported on Wednesday that Blackstone will sell Sona BLW Precision’s shares  in a block deal.  The PE firm offloaded 13.6% stake for Rs 509 per share, pocketing Rs 4,044 crore or $509 million. The deal comes on the back of a resurgence in the stock market after hitting a low in June. The markets have delivered a 17% return till date, and foreign investors are rushing back to Indian equities. Blackstone held 34.12% in Sona BLW as of 30 June, 2022 after selling a large chunk of its shareholding worth ₹5,250 crore during the company’s initial public offering (IPO) in June last year. Nomura Financial Advisory and Securities (India) Pvt. Ltd is the sole broker for the trade. The Blackstone block trade for Sona BLW comes immediately after KKR’s ₹9,185 crore block trade for Max Healthcare, which helped the private equity firm to sell its entire stake in the hospital chain.  The trade also follows the secondary sale by Uber, which sold its entire 7.78% stake in food delivery platform Zomato for ₹3,088 crore earlier this month. This has created a window of opportunity for all existing shareholders to explore secondary share sales through block trades, said experts.  Sona BLW listed on bourses on 14 June 2021 at a premium of nearly 4% over its issue price of Rs 291 per share. The IPO comprised of a fresh issue of Rs 300 crore and an offer-for-sale (OFS) of Rs 5,250 crore. The auto components maker designs, manufactures and supplies automotive systems such as differential assemblies, gears, conventional and micro-hybrid starter motors, EV traction motors and motor control units.  Share article on",https://www.vccircle.com//blackstonesells-partial-stake-in-auto-ancillary-sona-blw-precision,Finance,"The deal comes on the back of a resurgence in the stock market after hitting a low in June.The Blackstone block trade for Sona BLW comes immediately after KKR’s ₹9,185 crore block trade for Max Healthcare, which helped the private equity firm to sell its entire stake in the hospital chain.","['Blackstone', 'KKR', '₹']","['$500 million', '$509 million', '5,250']"
IFC taps on blockchain to bet on climate-friendly projects,17 August,"International Finance Corp (IFC), a World Bank affiliate, told Reuters on Wednesday it is backing a blockchain-enabled platform to trade carbon offsets, aiming to attract more support from institutional investors for climate-friendly projects in emerging markets.It is a bet that using blockchain - a digital database with information that can be publicly shared within a large decentralised network - will boost the use of carbon offsets to a greater extent than more traditional methods.These credits are used by companies and organisations to offset emissions when accounting for their carbon footprint. They are backed by projects that compensate for emissions, such as tree planting or creating solar and wind power.Several financial technology firms have sprung up over the last year to turn carbon offsets into digital tokens, yet the market has struggled to gain traction with companies and institutional investors amid concerns about the origin and environmental benefits of some of the traded credits. Blockchain technology has also been criticised by environmentalists as being too energy intensive.Verra, operator of the world's largest registry of carbon credits, has said it will not allow its retired carbon offsets to be tokenised, and has announced a consultation on the tokenisation of its credits.An IFC spokesperson told Reuters it would only source, tokenise and sell unused credits from an established registry that pass its additional quality checks.The IFC has partnered with sustainability finance company Aspiration, blockchain technology firm Chia Network and biodiversity investor Cultivo to launch the Carbon Opportunities Fund, which will provide the carbon offsets on blockchain.Seeded with $10 million as a proof-of-concept, the fund will buy carbon credits from projects chosen by Aspiration and Cultivo, which will then be tokenised using technology from Chia and tracked using the World Bank's Climate Warehouse database.A Verra spokesperson said it was speaking with the IFC about its role in the Climate Warehouse.""It's going to set a standard and a benchmarking for the market that makes it more likely other institutional capital will come in behind it,"" said Steve Glickman, president of Aspiration's international arm.Glickman added that only about 10% of carbon credit projects would currently meet the fund's criteria.Carbon credit markets are largely unregulated as governments have yet to agree on trading rules. Many countries and companies consider offsetting as a way to help meet their net-zero carbon emissions targets by 2050, a crucial goal to mitigate the effects of climate change.Yet only a third of the 50-60 gigatonnes of emissions that need to be slashed annually can be eliminated through renewable energy sources and efficiency measures, according to Aspiration.The IFC's fund has identified 250,000-300,000 tonnes of credits that can be bought by year-end and is conducting due diligence on projects that represent around 1 million tonnes of credits that could be available in the next few months.Bruce Keith, senior investment officer at the IFC, said the platform's transparency would help companies and investors better assign value to the environmental projects behind the offsets.""Why is a credit from the Amazon worth more or less than a credit from the Congo basin? Or more or less than a credit from a forest in the southern U.S.? You (now) have the means to know that,"" Keith said.Share article on",https://www.vccircle.com//ifctaps-on-blockchain-to-bet-on-climate-friendly-projects,Finance,"Blockchain technology has also been criticised by environmentalists as being too energy intensive.Verra, operator of the world's largest registry of carbon credits, has said it will not allow its retired carbon offsets to be tokenised, and has announced a consultation on the tokenisation of its credits.An IFC spokesperson told Reuters it would only source, tokenise and sell unused credits from an established registry that pass its additional quality checks.The IFC has partnered with sustainability finance company Aspiration, blockchain technology firm Chia Network and biodiversity investor Cultivo to launch the Carbon Opportunities Fund, which will provide the carbon offsets on blockchain.Seeded with $10 million as a proof-of-concept, the fund will buy carbon credits from projects chosen by Aspiration and Cultivo, which will then be tokenised using technology from Chia and tracked using the World Bank's Climate Warehouse database.A Verra spokesperson said it was speaking with the IFC about its role in the Climate Warehouse.Many countries and companies consider offsetting as a way to help meet their net-zero carbon emissions targets by 2050, a crucial goal to mitigate the effects of climate change.Yet only a third of the 50-60 gigatonnes of emissions that need to be slashed annually can be eliminated through renewable energy sources and efficiency measures, according to Aspiration.The IFC's fund has identified 250,000-300,000 tonnes of credits that can be bought by year-end and is conducting due diligence on projects that represent around 1 million tonnes of credits that could be available in the next few months.Bruce Keith, senior investment officer at the IFC, said the platform's transparency would help companies and investors better assign value to the environmental projects behind the offsets.","['Verra', 'Reuters', 'Chia Network', 'the Carbon Opportunities Fund', 'Aspiration and Cultivo', ""the World Bank's Climate Warehouse"", 'Verra', 'the Climate Warehouse', 'Aspiration', 'IFC']",['$10 million']

Razorpay to pick up controlling stake in Ezetap,16 August,"Digital payments solutions unicorn, Razorpay has agreed to pick up controlling stake in Bengaluru-based payment solutions provider, Ezetap Mobile Solutions for $126 million (Rs 1,000 crore) in a cash-and-stock deal, two individuals familiar with the deal told VCCircle.Out of the amount mentioned above, $100 million will be a cash transaction, while the remaining would be in equity, one of the individuals said requesting anonymity. Fintech Unicorn Razorpay Eyes Majority Stake In Ezetap Mobile  Razorpay competes with the likes of Paytm, Innoviti Payment Solutions and Pine Labs in the payment solutions space.Earlier in the day, news website Entrackr wrote about the development citing the regulatory filings by target firm's holding company in Singapore. The transaction is likely to close within a few days, the other person added.  Email queries sent to Razorpay and Ezetap went unanswered till press time.  Byas Nambisan, chief executive officer of Ezetap, earlier confirmed that his company is in discussion with several investors, mostly global and local strategic players, besides prominent venture capital funds to raise around Rs 450 crore in funding.   Nambisan took charge of Ezetap in 2019 after co-founders Abhijit Bose and Bhaktha Keshavachar quit to join WhatsApp and float another venture in deep technology space, respectively.   The startup, launched in 2011, had initially started in the fintech space by processing card payments on mobile phones, also known as mobile point-of-sale (mPOS), for large enterprises and businesses. The company was then catering to over 300 big and small enterprises, including the likes of Amazon, Airtel, Reliance, Indian Oil Corporation, ﻿Bigbasket﻿ and Urban Ladder.   However, the company pivoted to a bank partnership model and this turned around the fortunes of the company that has raised $55-60 million in funding till date. Under the model, the startup started approaching banks with full suite of solutions on an Android terminal, including sector-specific payment solutions and value-added features like billing, instant EMIs via debit and credit cards, auto reconciliation and analytics among others.   The startup is currently working with banks such as Axis Bank, HDFC Bank, and ICICI Bank. It has also tied up with government institutions including the municipal corporation of Chennai for tax collection, Guwahati Municipal Corporation to provide citizen services, and Bengaluru Traffic Police (E-challan App), among others.   The company has claimed to have processed $8 billion in annualized gross transaction value (GTV) through 4 lakh retail points as of 2022 and is aiming to reach Rs 7,500 crore in annual revenue by 2024.  Established in 2014, Razorpay Software, the subsidiary of Razorpay Inc., is a full-stack financial services company that provides technology payment solutions to over 8 million businesses.    Founded by alumni of IIT Roorkee, Kumar and Harshil Mathur, Razorpay is the second Indian company to be a part of Silicon Valley’s largest tech accelerator, Y Combinator.    So far, Razorpay has raised $741.5 million in capital so far and was valued at $7.5 billion in December 2021, emerging as the second most highly priced startup in India after Paytm. It is backed by the likes of Lone Pine Capital, Alkeon Capital, TCV, GIC, Tiger Global, Sequoia Capital India, Ribbit Capital, Matrix Partners, Salesforce Ventures, Y Combinator and MasterCard.    Razopay had already struck a few acquisitions offlate. In February this year, it had bought a majority stake in Malaysia-based fintech firm Curlec, marking its first international acquisition.  Razorpay acquired Tera Finlabs, an artificial intelligence (AI)-based risk tech SaaS (software-as-a-service) platform in 2020. The company also acquired Opfin, a payroll and HR management solution in 2019.

"Go Digit Insurance files for IPO, seeks to raise Rs 1,250 cr",16 August,"Virat Kohli-backed Go Digit Insurance has filed for an initial public offering (IPO) with markets regulator Securities and Exchanges Board of India. The company, backed by Candian billionaire Prem Watsa’s Fairfax Group aims to raise Rs 1,250 crore via the IPO. According to a draft red herring prospectus (Drhp) filed with Sebi, the IPO will also consist of an offer-for-sale (OFS) of 10.94 crore shares for an undisclosed amount, by existing promoters and selling shareholders.  Promoters will trim their stake via the IPO - Go Digit Infoworks (up to 10.9 crore shares); Nikita Vakharia and Mihir Vakharia (up to 4,000 shares); Nikunj Shah and Sohag Shah (up to 3,778 shares); Subramaniam Vasudevan with Shanti Subramaniam (up to 3,000 equity shares). The proceeds from the fresh issue will be utilized for the augmentation of Go Digit’s capital base and maintenance of solvency levels. The new age insurer claims a rise of 68% in its FY22 assets under management (AUM), to Rs 9,393.8 crore from Rs 5,590.1 crore in FY21. The company is also in consultation with merchant bankers for a pre-IPO placement of equity shares, or any other method aggregating up to Rs 250 crore. Should such a placement occur, the fresh issue size will be reduced, the Drhp added.  Founded in 2017, Go Digit offers motor, health, travel, property, marine and liability insurance and claims to be one of the top 10 private general insurers by gross written premium (GWP) in FY20 and FY21. The Bengaluru-based company counts marquee investment houses like Sequoia Capital, A91 Partners, Faering Capital, TVS Capital, among its list of investors. ICICI Securities, Morgan Stanley India, Axis Capital, Edelweiss Financial, HDFC Bank and IIFL Securities are the book running lead managers for Go Digit’s IPO. Insurance regulator IRDAI requires companies to be at least 5 years old before listing on stock exchanges. Go Digit turns 5 next month.  The insurtech platform became the first startup to turn unicorn in 2021, on January 15, and will be the second new age insurance company after PB Fintech-owned PolicyBazaar, to list on bourses.  A unicorn is a privately help startup with a valuation of $1 billion or more. According to the Drhp, its gross written premium for the FY22 period stood at Rs 5,268 crore, a growth of 38.4% from Rs 3,243 crore in FY21. Its net expense ratio has decreased to 38.7% in FY22 from 35.4% in FY21 and claims to have a strong capital position with a solvency ratio of 2.01 as of March 31, 2022.  IRDAI mandates a minimum solvency ratio of 1.5 for any insurer. As per Go Digit’s financial highlights for the FY22 period, the company’s net loss for the year more than doubled to Rs 295 crore versus Rs 121 crore during the previous year whereas its total income rose nearly 41.4% to Rs 3,841 crore versus Rs 2,251 crore in FY21.  Share article on",https://www.vccircle.com//godigit-insurance-files-for-ipo-seeks-to-raise-rs-1-250-cr,Finance,"Promoters will trim their stake via the IPO - Go Digit Infoworks (up to 10.9 crore shares); Nikita Vakharia and Mihir Vakharia (up to 4,000 shares); Nikunj Shah and Sohag Shah (up to 3,778 shares); Subramaniam Vasudevan with Shanti Subramaniam (up to 3,000 equity shares).As per Go Digit’s financial highlights for the FY22 period, the company’s net loss for the year more than doubled to Rs 295 crore versus Rs 121 crore during the previous year whereas its total income rose nearly 41.4% to Rs 3,841 crore versus Rs 2,251 crore in FY21.",['IPO'],['$1 billion']
US Fed - A little too late in the war against inflation?,16 August,"The US Federal Reserve is hiking interest rates at the most aggressive pace in a generation, but the financial conditions it needs to tighten to tame soaring inflation are heading in the wrong direction.A rally in equities and falling government bond yields since the Fed's June hike means financial conditions are actually loosening, despite the U.S. economy having been hit with a combined 150 basis points of rate hikes at that meeting and the next one.Financial conditions reflect the availability of funding in an economy. They dictate spending, saving and investment plans of businesses and households, so central banks want them to tighten to help control inflation, which is now running far above their target levels.A widely followed U.S. financial conditions index (FCI) compiled by Goldman Sachs, which factors in borrowing costs, equity levels and exchange rates, has loosened some 80 basis points (bps) since the Fed's June meeting.A similar index from the Chicago Federal Reserve, which tracks financial conditions independent of prevailing economic conditions, has turned negative, implying conditions are loose relative to what the current economic picture would usually suggest.In the euro zone, conditions have also loosened by about 40 basis points, according to Goldman Sachs, and money markets have priced out most of the 2023 rate hikes they had previously expected.""Back in June we thought that (U.S.) financial conditions were broadly where they should be to engineer the slowdown that you need to bring activity, wage growth and price inflation back to target,"" said Daan Struyven, senior global economist at Goldman Sachs.""Our best guess is that they've eased a little too much.""The change in conditions has been driven by recession fears, which have prompted markets to not only reduce how far they expect the Fed to hike, but also to price in rate cuts next year. This suggests investors think the Fed will be more concerned by a slowing economy rather than inflation next year.Fed Chairman Jerome Powell's comments following the bank's July rate hike were also interpreted by some investors as implying a ""dovish pivot"".Money markets now expect Fed hikes to stop at around 3.6% next March, compared with the 4%-plus expected before the June hike, followed by some 50 bps of cuts by the end of 2023.Since the June hike, the S&P 500 has gained 13%, oil prices are down 22% and 10-year U.S. Treasury yields have fallen 70 bps. Credit markets have also rallied.To be sure, financial conditions are still some 200 bps tighter than late 2021's record low, and stocks remain 10% down for 2022.Goldman estimates a 100 basis points tightening in its FCI will crimp economic growth by one percentage point in the coming year.But the recent loosening is approaching what the bank terms an ""FCI loop"", Struyven said.""If you see very significant additional financial conditions easing that would probably not be sustainable because the outlook for activity, wage growth and inflation would look too hot.""UNFINISHED JOBThat risk is already reflected in market gauges of long-term inflation expectations.The 10-year US breakeven rate has risen some 15 bps to 2.44% since early July. Euro zone expectations have risen too.""That dovish interpretation was the reason why inflation expectations were driven up again. This just goes to show that the Fed still has an unfinished job ahead of itself,"" said Patrick Saner, head of macro strategy at Swiss Re.Data last week showing US inflation unchanged in July instead of rising fuelled a further loosening in financial conditions.But recent US jobs and wage growth data point to increasingly tight labour markets.Economists note the US unemployment rate, at 3.5%, is far lower than the lowest level -- 4.4% according to the Congressional Budget Office -- it can reach without boosting inflation.Annual wage growth of 5.2% is way above the 3.5% Goldman estimates is necessary to pull inflation down to the Fed's target of 2%.PUSHING BACKSeveral Fed policymakers have pushed back against the shift in market pricing, emphasising determination to keep tightening policy until price pressures abate.They also say that it is unlikely that the Fed will pivot to cutting rates in 2023. A pricing out of those cuts would tighten financial conditions.Financial conditions need to tighten more and for that to happen, ""you either need to see some declines in risk assets, equity prices or increases in longer-dated yields. Typically, it's a combination,"" Saner said.Goldman Sachs expects 10-year US Treasury yields to reach 3.30% by year-end, up from today's 2.80%.Others are sceptical of current equity valuations. Morgan Stanley expects the S&P 500 to fall some 9% by June next year.UBS analysts note that the stock market currently is consistent with core inflation returning to 1.5%-2%.

India's July inflation eases to 6.71% as some commodity prices fall,12 August,"India's consumer inflation dipped to 6.71% in July, easing for the third month in a row, helped by a slower increase in food and fuel prices and adding to expectations that the central bank may rein in the pace of its policy rate hikes next month.The year-on-year figure, published on Friday by the National Statistics Office, was marginally lower than the 6.78% forecast by economists in a Reuters poll.

"Bruised by a valuation freefall, payments companies brace for M&A",12 August,"Battered by a near 50% plunge in its shares over the last 12 months, Nexi, Europe's biggest payments processor, has not gone unnoticed.Earlier this year, the Italian company received several unsolicited approaches from private equity firms including Silver Lake wishing to take the business private, two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters.Discussions between the U.S. buyout firm and Nexi Chief Executive Paolo Bertoluzzo faltered before the end of March due to differences on price for the 11 billion-euro, Milan-listed company, the sources said.Nexi and Silver Lake declined to comment.Shares in Nexi jumped 7.4% on the Reuters report and were temporarily suspended from trading. They were up 6% at 1344 GMT.While it is not clear if potential buyers for Nexi will come knocking again, discussions among European and North American payments companies and potential acquirers are heating up again, bankers and industry experts said.The gap in expectations over pricing is narrowing as company executives adjust to the idea that valuations, hit by the high-growth tech stock rout, won't return to previous peaks any time soon.""Many companies which went public the last few years are realizing that being public isn't always a good thing, especially if they are subscale or have yet to achieve profitability,"" said Peter Christodoulo, partner at Francisco Partners.While current disruption in debt capital markets may curtail some dealmaking, the more proactive attitude among sellers is expected to lead to an increase in deal volumes through the year-end and into 2023, the sources said. Global Payments Inc's $4 billion swoop on smaller peer EVO Payments Inc on Aug. 1 may trigger a chain reaction as companies vie for market share, the sources said.Fiserv Inc and FIS could follow Global Payments in doing similar bolt-on deals, while large-scale M&A remains challenging, they said.Fiserv's chief strategy and growth officer, Byron Vielehr, said the company's strategy was focused on driving innovation for its clients but declined to comment on specific acquisitions.FIS did not respond to a comment request.BTRS Holdings Inc is among the dozen payments companies which went public in the United States between October 2020 and November 2021. The owner of business payments vendor Billtrust is now exploring options including a potential sale, sources told Reuters last month.Paya Holdings Inc, previously the U.S. payment arm of Britain's Sage Group, is also pursuing a sale after making its Nasdaq debut in 2020, the sources said.Paya did not respond to a request for comment.Shares in BTRS and Paya have lost around 38% and 28%, respectively, over the past 12 months, although both have recovered ground amid reports they are reviewing options.While payments providers which listed before 2020 have also suffered, the trend is accentuated among those who hit the public markets during the pandemic - either through a traditional initial public offering (IPO) or merging with a blank-check firm. Investor sentiment has turned following a retreat from high-growth technology assets due to rising interest rates.""Payments companies are fundamentally defensive and well positioned for an inflationary environment, so if public investors won't recognize the true value of some of these names, there will be private investors who will,"" said Jeff Paduch, managing partner at Advent International.Paduch is a board member of Nexi, but declined comment on any aspect of the Italian company's operations.Privately held firms have not been immune to the carnage, with both payments processor Stripe Inc and fintech Klarna Bank

"Paytm shares fall as investor advisory firm flags Sharma's CEO reappointment, remuneration",12 August,"Shares of One97 Communications, the parent of Paytm, fell by as much as 5% in early trade on Friday, following a report by an advisory firm opposing its chief Vijay Shekhar Sharma's reappointment as CEO and raising doubts on the company's path to profitability.Paytm's shares dragged down even as the company said in its stock market disclosure on Friday that its loan distribution business scaled to 2.9 million total loan disbursals during the month of July, growing by 296%.This aggregates to a total loan value of Rs 2,090 crore ($264 million) during the month, growing by 512%.“We continue to work with our partners to review the evolving macro environment and accordingly slight moderation may be expected in our growth. That said, we continue to see ample growth and upsell opportunities in this business and are focusing on quality of the book (given possibility of macro headwinds),” the disclosure noted.However, this was not enough for Paytm's shares to recover. Shares of Paytm were trading at Ra 792.15 apiece, down 4.4%, on the BSE, in afternoon trade.The shares fell largely after Paytm’s proposal to reappoint Vijay Shekhar Sharma as the CEO for another five years was opposed by advisory firm Institutional Investor Advisory Services India Limited (IiAS). The advisory firm, in a detailed report, also flagged the remuneration decided for the post.Vijay Shekhar Sharma's FY23 remuneration is estimated at Rs 796.28 crore which comprises 21 million stock options at an exercise price of Rs 9, a deep discount to the market price on the date of grant (fair value spread across the vesting period), the IiAS report noted. He was also granted 46.5% of the entire stock option pool, which is equal to 3.2% of the outstanding share capital. But there is no disclosure regarding the vesting conditions, the report said.""His overall remuneration is higher than the remuneration levels of all S&P BSE Sensex companies’ CEOs – and most of these companies are profitable. The company is seeking shareholder approval for the
proposed remuneration as minimum remuneration – which will be paid to him even if the company continues to report losses,"" the report pointed, opposing his remuneration.
 
The report also opposed the proposal to reappoint Ravi Chandra Adusumalli as director. Adusumalli is founder and managing partner at Elevation Capital (formerly SAIF Partners), an early investor in Paytm.""We note that Ravi Chandra Adusumalli is a member of the Audit Committee. We raise concern over the issues raised by the auditors, that loans and advances extended have had delayed repayments, and that the company, despite reporting staggering losses, proposes to spend Rs 100 million annually on charitable donations,"" the report noted. The report was also critical of Adusumalli for attending only 47% of the board meetings in FY22.The report while supporting the appointment of Madhur Deora as whole-time director, raised red flag over his remuneration as well.""We estimate Madhur Deora’s remuneration at Rs 358.5 million for FY23, which is high for the size and performance of business and not in line with peers,"" it stated. Deora has been associated with Paytm since 2016. He was previously with Citigroup Global Markets India.IiAS further said in the report that since listing, the company’s stock price has fallen by 63.6% (from the issue price of Rs. 2,150), resulting in wealth destruction for shareholders.   “Vijay Shekhar Sharma has made several commitments in the past to make the company profitable, however these have not played out. We believe the board must consider professionalizing the management,” it said.Paytm's net loss widened to Rs 644.4 crore in the June quarter against a loss of Rs 380.2 crore in the corresponding quarter of the last financial year.The IiAS report also observed that on Paytm's financial statement for FY22, it has relied upon the auditors’ report, which has raised an emphasis of matter, regarding uncertainty related
impact of Covid-19 and non-realization of foreign currency receivable balances of Rs 35.5 crore outstanding beyond the stipulated time period. An emphasis of matters is a paragraph included in the auditor’s report that refers to a matter appropriately presented or disclosed in the financial statements
that, in the auditor’s judgment, is of such importance that it is fundamental to users’ understanding of the financial statements.The IiAS report also said that it raises concern on loans (including interest) aggregating Rs 106.8 crore to five entities, where repayments have been delayed. The nature of the relationship with some of these entities is unclear, it addedPaytm’s stock has taken a hammering in the capital markets since it got listed on the bourses in November last year at an IPO price of Rs 2,150. At the IPO price, Paytm had a market capitalization of nearly Rs 1.4 trillion, which has since reduced to Rs 51,411.69 crore.  Hence, it has also lost its tag as the most-valued startup in India to Byju's (at the IPO price, it was seeking a valuation of about $600 million more than the edtech startup's valuation). The company also lost its tag as the most-valued fintech startup in India, and now trails RazorPay's $7.5 billion valuation in the Indian fintech space.  Earlier this week, SoftBank Group Corp said it has marked down its investment in Paytm by $400 million for the quarter ended June, adding to its overall loss of $23.1 billion for the period.The tech firm’s investment cost in One97 Communications was $1.4 billion in 2017, made through a mix of primary and secondary share purchases. The fair value of its investment stood at $1 billion at the end of 30 June, according to its financial statement posted, indicating an on-paper loss of $400 million.Share article on",https://www.vccircle.com//paytmslips-6-on-questions-over-ceo-reappointment-regulatory-fears,Finance,"Shares of One97 Communications, the parent of Paytm, fell by as much as 5% in early trade on Friday, following a report by an advisory firm opposing its chief Vijay Shekhar Sharma's reappointment as CEO and raising doubts on the company's path to profitability.Paytm's shares dragged down even as the company said in its stock market disclosure on Friday that its loan distribution business scaled to 2.9 million total loan disbursals during the month of July, growing by 296%.This aggregates to a total loan value of Rs 2,090 crore ($264 million) during the month, growing by 512%.“We continue to work with our partners to review the evolving macro environment and accordingly slight moderation may be expected in our growth.We believe the board must consider professionalizing the management,” it said.Paytm's net loss widened to Rs 644.4 crore in the June quarter against a loss of Rs 380.2 crore in the corresponding quarter of the last financial year.The IiAS report also observed that on Paytm's financial statement for FY22, it has relied upon the auditors’ report, which has raised an emphasis of matter, regarding uncertainty related impact of Covid-19 and non-realization of foreign currency receivable balances of Rs 35.5 crore outstanding beyond the stipulated time period.",[],"['$264 million', 'about $600 million', '$7.5 billion', '$400 million', '$23.1 billion', '$1.4 billion', '$1 billion', '$400 million']"

"TPG quarterly earnings more than triple on fee growth, asset sales",09 August,"TPG Inc said on Tuesday its second-quarter after-tax distributable earnings more than tripled, owing to strong growth in management fees and asset sales from its private equity portfolio.The Fort Worth, Texas-based firm said after-tax distributable earnings - which represents the cash used to pay dividends to shareholders - rose to $162 million in the second quarter, up from $53 million a year ago. That exceeded the average analyst forecast of $109 million, according to Refinitiv data.TPG said the value of all its funds depreciated during the quarter due to the market downturn, hurt by rising interest rates and the impact of the Russia-Ukraine war. Its private equity fund valuations fell 2.4% while its growth and impact portfolios declined 2.8% and 1.1%, respectively. That result was in line with peers Blackstone Inc, Carlyle Group Inc, KKR & Co Inc and Apollo Global Management Inc, which all reported a drop in their fund valuations in the second quarter.""I think that our portfolio continues to perform well and across the broad portfolio we still have above-market revenue and EBITDA growth,"" TPG CEO Jon Winkelried said in an interview. TPG said it generated $4.4 billion in total asset sales during the quarter, consisting mostly of deals agreed prior to the downturn.

SoftBank speeds up sale of assets after historic Vision Fund loss,09 August,"SoftBank Group Corp is accelerating asset sales after its flagship Vision Fund unit booked nearly $50 billion in losses in just six months, but Chief Executive Masayoshi Son faces narrowing options and slumping valuations, analysts said.Son said on Monday that he is in discussions to sell asset manager Fortress, without commenting on a valuation. SoftBank also raised $2.4 billion selling shares in T-Mobile US during the latest quarter, while unloading a variety of other holdings.But as valuations fall, easy options for raising cash are getting harder to come by.With SoftBank having shifted focus from operating companies to tech investing, and Son staking his reputation on generating big returns that can be recycled into further tech bets, the billionaire will be keen to avoid selling Vision Fund assets at a loss, analysts said.""Most of the portfolio is underwater, making the case to sell harder to justify,"" Redex Research analyst Kirk Boodry wrote in a note. He pointed to e-commerce firm Coupang and food delivery firm DoorDash as potential candidates.Vision Fund exited a swathe of assets in the April-June quarter - including ridehailer Uber Technologies and property platforms Opendoor Technologies and KE Holdings, which operates China's Beike - for a realised gain of $5.6 billion.SoftBank sold the final tranche of Uber shares at a loss, Boodry calculates, and generated a total return of just $1.5 billion on the stake.

"India's fintech industry to touch $1 trillion in AUM, $200 bn revenue by 2030: Chiratae report",09 August,"India's fintech industry is estimated to grow ten-fold by 2030 to achieve an assets under management (AUM) of $1 trillion and revenue of $200 billion, according to a report published  by venture capital firm Chiratae Ventures and consultancy firm EY.Payments and lending are expected to account for 75% of the total revenue, TC Meenakshi Sundaram, co-founder and vice chairperson, Chiratae Ventures, said in an interaction with VCCircle, underlining the dominance of these two segments within fintech. However, he added that fintech is becoming more horizontal in nature,  cutting across all segments such that even in areas such as agritech and proptech, there is a fintech play today.  This trend will emerge in other areas as well, he said. ""Fintech is an efficient credit delivery mechanism in a world where existing or traditional financial services players are unable to deliver credit at an affordable cost and at a faster rate,"" he noted.The report showed that funding in the fintech space in 2021 grew to $7.8 billion from $2.9 billion in the previous year. Payments attracted the highest amount of funding at 44% of the total amount followed by lending (16%). The rest was distributed among wealthtech, insurtech , neobanking, and blockchain and crypto.""India is now being recognized as one of the largest fintech unicorn ecosystems, home to 21 fintech unicorns as of March 2022,"" the report noted. A unicorn is a privately held startup with a valuation of at least $1 billion. Fintech unicorns in India include Slice, Razorpay and OneCard. The report added that an organic and collaborative ecosystem is driving the growth of fintech in the country, helped by key government initiatives and the development of UPI, among others.The payments industry alone is expected to reach more than $100 trillion by 2030, the report said. It added that the payments industry has been evolving on the back of government policies and new business models.It noted that the challenges faced by the payments ecosystem are low penetration of traditional financial instruments, lack of customer loyalty, low profitability and cash preferring society.Digital lending clocked more than $9 billion in investments over the last five years and is expected to reach a $515 billion book size by 2030 on the back of product and business model innovations. The major growth drivers of the digital lending space is easy market entry and targeted loan offerings due to availability of large sets of customer data and better margins than other fintech business models, it explained.Fintechs are also unlocking opportunities in digital lending through segment-focused digital business models, the report pointed.The report also said that Buy Now Pay Later (BNPL) has become mainstream and is on an accelerated growth trajectory, emerging strong not only in business to consumer (B2C) but also business-to-business (B2B) payments space. Apart from pureplay BNPL startups, players like Simpl, Lazypay, Zestmoney other matured new age entities like Flipkart and Paytm also offer BNPL services.The insurtech space is expected to hit $88 bilion in size by 2030 as it is expanding beyond discoverability and listing. The space is currently evolving with a partnership approach and more positive changes may be in store with the current regulatory regime, it noted.  Chiratae Ventures' insurtech portfolio firm, PB Fintech Ltd, the owner of online platform Policybazaar and Paisabazaar, listed on the stock exchanges last year.The wealthtech market is expected to grow to $237 billion by 2030 on the back of a growing base of retail investors. The segment is ready for disruption because of favourable demographics with higher disposable incomes, increased awareness and rising digital adoption besides business model innovations. It also noted that regulators are likely to strike a balance between investor protection and access to innovative tools created by wealthtech startups.The report also said that new asset classes, crypto and non fungible tokens (NFT) will also continue to attract investor interest as fintechs continue to solve for traditionally underserved customers.""Although the regulatory stance is blurry, new players are emerging in the crypto and NFT space in India,"" it pointed, adding that emergence of mainstream virtual digital asset portfolio advisory is likely.The report also said that neo-banking has seen a five times surge in funding in just the last year and is expected to hit a $215 billion mark by 2030. Earlier this year, neo bank Open turned into a unicorn after raising $50 million led by IIFL.""Surge in digital financial services has attracted global neo-banking players and established domestic players, however regulatory hurdles to be expected,"" it added.

Uber sees road to profitability in India,09 August,"US ride-hailing platform, Uber, says it expects India to become a high-growth yet profitable market soon. Pradeep Parameshwaran, the company's regional general manager for the Asia-Pacific region, said the company sees heavy demand in the country and the low penetration of ride-hailing in India, which it hopes would translate into more opportunity.“It’s a steady march. Every year our unit economics are doing better than the previous year. We don’t have an exact timeline to be profitable in India. But I’d say it’s not that far away either,” Parameshwaran told a section of the media in an interaction in Sydney last week, even as he dissed rumours about possibly exiting the country or merging with competitor Ola.He added that pre-Covid, the category of people who could afford Uber’s services was growing at 15-20% in India. Parmeshwaran pointed out that ride-hailing penetration is 0.3% in India, which is just one-tenth of the penetration numbers in markets like the US. “Frankly, we have runway for the next decade plus (with respect to demand),” he said. “Our unit economics have improved dramatically in the last three-four years. I feel very good about where we are on that journey, and over time I have no doubt that India will be a high-growth market which will also be profitable,” he said. “But right now, we are in the investment phase, like intercity, high capacity vehicles (HCV), we have to spend on marketing, technology, and customer care and more,” he added.Globally, the company reported its first-ever cash flow positive quarter in its 13 years of existence for the June quarter. While Uber reported a net loss of $2.6 billion for the second quarter (of which it attributed $1.7 billion to investments and revaluation of stakes in Aurora, Grab and Zomato), it posted $382 million in free cash flow. Total revenue for the June quarter stood at $8.07 billion (Uber does not provide separate country figures).It sees India as a long term investment and is looking to push two and three-wheeler products in the country.According to a report by Public First commissioned by Uber, earnings for driver-partners and indirect effects, like maintenance of cars, etc., created economic value worth Rs.446 billion in India in 2021. The report also estimated that Uber created a consumer surplus of Rs.1.5 trillion in India last year.According to Paremeshwaran, expanding the modes of transport and improving service quality, which has declined due to shortage of drivers and high-fuel costs post pandemic, is among the chief concerns for the company right now. Uber Moto and Uber Auto, which offer rides on motorbikes and auto-rickshaws, are among the fastest growing segments for Uber in India. However, the company said that expanding to the two- and three-wheeler markets has been difficult for the firm. “On three-wheelers, some states are outright saying that your licence doesn’t apply. So we’re stuck in bureaucratic knots, which are inefficient,” Mike Orgill, Senior Director, Public Policy and Government Relations, APAC at Uber, told Mint. He added that safety concerns and the issue of “can you transport somebody on something that’s not a commercial vehicle” have affected the Moto business.Orgill also said that Uber has “encouraged” the government to open up the ride-hailing space to everyone, so that anyone can drive cars on platforms like Uber, without commercial licences as long as they meet the safety standards and pay the right taxes commensurate with the activity. He added that rules and regulations India applies to two- and three wheelers could impact countries in Latin America, the Middle East, South America and other places where such transport is common. The country’s Code on Social Security, 2020, also sets it ahead of others in terms of creating labour laws for gig workers, according to Uber.“We want outcome focused regulation, so that if we start to see better ways to do things with technology, we’re happy for the government to take a look at it and figure out if it’s good or not,” Orgill said. “What we’re trying to get to is, say what is it that you’re really trying to get to in terms of safety, customer protection, driver welfare outcomes, and how do we set those as goals versus being prescriptive in terms of how you do it. Because once you’re prescriptive, we’re locked in to doing it as prescribed, and the government basically is running the business when we feel like there’s technology that we could be taking advantage of,” he said.Lastly, the company said it wants to deploy more electric vehicles (EVs) in India in the coming years. While it does not have any electric vehicles in the country, Uber has pledged to have an all-electric fleet globally by 2040.(Note: The writer was in Sydney, Australia, to attend a press event sponsored by Uber).Share article on",https://www.vccircle.com//ubersees-road-to-profitability-in-india,Finance,"He added that safety concerns and the issue of “can you transport somebody on something that’s not a commercial vehicle” have affected the Moto business.Orgill also said that Uber has “encouraged” the government to open up the ride-hailing space to everyone, so that anyone can drive cars on platforms like Uber, without commercial licences as long as they meet the safety standards and pay the right taxes commensurate with the activity.Because once you’re prescriptive, we’re locked in to doing it as prescribed, and the government basically is running the business when we feel like there’s technology that we could be taking advantage of,” he said.Lastly, the company said it wants to deploy more electric vehicles (EVs) in India in the coming years.",['Moto'],"['$2.6 billion', '$1.7 billion', '$382 million', '$8.07 billion', 'Rs.446 billion']"

SoftBank planning pink slips at Vision Fund after record quarterly loss,08 August,"SoftBank Group Corp is planning to cut headcount at its flagship Vision Fund investing arm, CEO Masayoshi Son said on Monday, after a crash in the value of its portfolio pushed his conglomerate to a record quarterly net loss.Vision Fund, which upended the world of venture capital with splashy bets on startups such as ridehailers Uber and Didi, posted a $23.1 billion loss in the April-June quarter as value evaporated from its investments in the market rout.""The world is in great confusion,"" Son said at an earnings news conference.The result caps a tumultous six months for the Vision Fund, which posted a record $26.2 billion quarterly loss in May after SoftBank was caught out by rising interest rates and political instability that hammered markets globally.Son has already radically scaled back investment activity. The Vision Fund arm approved just $600 million in new investments in the first quarter, compared with $20.6 billion in the same period a year earlier.On Monday, the billionaire pledged to go further: limiting the second fund just to managing its current portfolio of investments, while planning workforce cuts at Vision Fund and cost reductions across the group.""We need to cut costs with no sacred areas,"" Son said.Son had already suffered a series of high-profile reversals after big bets by the first Vision Fund in late-stage startups such as office sharing company WeWork soured, prompting him to tighten investment controls with the second fund.However, the billionaire said Vision Fund 2, which has taken smaller stakes in a larger number of companies, had invested at frothy prices.""We were in a kind of bubble on valuations,"" he said.The second Vision Fund's portfolio of 269 firms, which cost $48.2 billion to acquire, was worth just $37.2 billion at end-June.""If we had been more selective and invested better, we wouldn't have received this heavy blow,"" Son said.Listed investments that fell during the quarter included warehouse robotics firm AutoStore Holdings Ltd and artificial intelligence firm SenseTime Group Inc.SoftBank said it wrote down the value of unlisted assets across its two Vision Funds by 1.14 trillion yen ($8.45 billion). Analysts have said write-downs of those private assets were unlikely to reflect the extent of current market weakness.Plunging initial public offering volumes and market scepticism towards money-losing startups have squeezed an important source of capital for SoftBank, which hopes to list chip designer Arm following the collapse of a sale to Nvidia.To raise cash, SoftBank has exited companies including ride hailer Uber Technologies and home-selling platform Opendoor Technologies, for a total gain of $5.6 billion.SoftBank sold Uber at an average share price of $41.47, compared to the Friday closing price of $32.01.The group has used more than two-thirds of the capital in a 1 trillion yen buyback programme launched last November to support its shares, which are down 5% year-to-date, compared to a 2% drop in Tokyo's benchmark Nikkei 225.SoftBank on Monday announced an additional share repurchase programme worth up to 400 billion yen to run to August next year.The conglomerate is not the only investor heavily exposed to the high-growth stocks now shunned by investors.Hedge fund Tiger Global, which competes with ""unicorn hunter"" Son on deals, saw its flagship fund fall 50% in the first half of the year after it underestimated the impact of surging inflation on markets.Share article on",https://www.vccircle.com//softbanks-vision-fund-suffers-17-bn-loss-for-april-june-period,Finance,"SoftBank Group Corp is planning to cut headcount at its flagship Vision Fund investing arm, CEO Masayoshi Son said on Monday, after a crash in the value of its portfolio pushed his conglomerate to a record quarterly net loss.Vision Fund, which upended the world of venture capital with splashy bets on startups such as ridehailers Uber and Didi, posted a $23.1 billion loss in the April-June quarter as value evaporated from its investments in the market rout.Analysts have said write-downs of those private assets were unlikely to reflect the extent of current market weakness.Plunging initial public offering volumes and market scepticism towards money-losing startups have squeezed an important source of capital for SoftBank, which hopes to list chip designer Arm following the collapse of a sale to Nvidia.To raise cash, SoftBank has exited companies including ride hailer Uber Technologies and home-selling platform Opendoor Technologies, for a total gain of $5.6 billion.SoftBank sold Uber at an average share price of $41.47, compared to the Friday closing price of $32.01.The group has used more than two-thirds of the capital in a 1 trillion yen buyback programme launched last November to support its shares, which are down 5% year-to-date, compared to a 2% drop in Tokyo's benchmark Nikkei 225.SoftBank on Monday announced an additional share repurchase programme worth up to 400 billion yen to run to August next year.The conglomerate is not the only investor heavily exposed to the high-growth stocks now shunned by investors.Hedge fund Tiger Global, which competes with ""unicorn hunter"" Son on deals, saw its flagship fund fall 50% in the first half of the year after it underestimated the impact of surging inflation on markets.Share article on","['SoftBank Group Corp', 'Vision Fund', 'Masayoshi Son', 'Vision Fund', 'SoftBank', 'SoftBank', 'Uber Technologies', 'Opendoor Technologies', 'SoftBank', 'Uber', 'Nikkei 225.SoftBank']","['$23.1 billion', 'a record $26.2 billion', 'just $600 million', '$20.6 billion', '$48.2 billion', 'just $37.2 billion', '1.14 trillion yen', '$8.45 billion', '$5.6 billion', '41.47', '$32.01.The', '1 trillion yen', 'up to 400 billion yen']"

Monthly transactions will touch $4-5 bn in 2 years: Pine Labs CEO,05 August,"Pine Labs is targeting $4-5 billion in monthly transactions within two years for its new online payments business, its chief executive told Reuters.At that point, online payments should contribute 20% of revenue, Pine Labs chief executive Amrish Rau said, disclosing the company's targets for the first time since it entered online payments.Valued at $5 billion and with investors including Mastercard and Singapore's Temasek, Pine Labs has for years provided point-of-sale machines to offline merchants for card payments.Last year, it launched Plural, a service to process online transactions in the country's booming payments market.Rau said Plural was currently processing $380 million in transactions monthly, but that would grow 10 to 15 times in the next two years. The monthly transaction value would be $4-5 billion, he also said.In the first 10 months, Plural had bagged the online transaction processing business of new clients including Samsung India and Apple's Indian resellers, Rau added.""Offline payments (business) is much more difficult than online and we have already cracked that. Merchants expect high transaction success rate from online payments. We can give any competitor a run for their money,"" he said.Digital transactions make up 40% of all transactions in India's fast-growing payment space, according to Boston Consulting Group. A government push for people to pay digitally is helping to drive the rise of digital transactions.Indians made card payments worth $22.6 billion in May 2022, nearly twice as much as a year earlier, according to central bank data.Pine competes directly with other payment gateways such as Sequoia-backed Razorpay, which is valued at $7 billion, and Prosus-owned PayU.For Pine Labs, competition will remain stiff, as rivals offer similar services and are already well established.""Everyone provides the same service, so differentiation is very hard in the long run,"" said an executive at a rival payments firm who declined to be named due to business sensitivities.Pine Labs is trying to lure customers by offering a processing fee 10 to 12 basis points lower than some rivals', according to an industry source with direct knowledge.The company is currently clocking around $200 million in annual revenue, the source added.Rau did not comment on his fee structures or revenue.The company will evaluate a stock market listing in coming years, after raising more than $1 billion from investors in the past 15 months.""Markets are still trying to find its feet in terms of high interest (rates and) inflation.

RBI hikes repo rate for third consecutive time,05 August,"The Reserve Bank of India's key policy repo rate was raised by 50 basis points on Friday, the third increase in as many months to cool stubbornly high inflation.With June retail inflation hitting 7%, economists polled by Reuters had expected another rate hike, but views were widely split between a 25-bp move or a 50-bp increase.The monetary policy committee (MPC) raised the key lending rate or the repo rate to 5.40%. The Standing Deposit Facility rate and the Marginal Standing Facility rate were accordingly adjusted higher by the same quantum to 5.15% and 5.65%, respectively.COMMENTARYPRITHVIRAJ SRINIVAS, CHIEF ECONOMIST, AXIS CAPITAL, MUMBAI""The central bank's action is largely along expected lines and will be seen as part of a series of steps to take the policy rate to neutral viz. near 6%. Roughly 1% positive real rate over 5% CPI expected in the June quarter 2023.""""The governor noted that the central bank is ready to conduct liquidity operations on both sides i.e. inject and absorb liquidity through the repo facility as required. This is an indication that the RBI is adopting a neutral stance even though it hasn't explicitly changed its forward guidance language.""NIKHIL GUPTA, CHIEF ECONOMIST, MOTILAL OSWAL GROUP, MUMBAI""Overall, the RBI's action and statement were not as dovish as we had expected. Therefore, it is very likely that the terminal rate in this rate-hike episode will be higher than our expectations. We, thus, revise it to 5.75-6% from 5.5% expected earlier.""AURODEEP NANDI, INDIA ECONOMIST, NOMURA, MUMBAI""The RBI's 50-bp hike was largely in line with market expectations, divided between it and a 35-bp hike. With the RBI retaining its policy stance of 'withdrawal of accommodation', the implicit message is that rates are yet to reach neutral territory, and that more rate hikes are warranted – a view that we agree with. The RBI continues to signal that all options are on the table, which is a prudent strategy given the elevated levels of uncertainties on both growth as well as inflation.""RADHIKA RAO, ECONOMIST, DBS BANK, SINGAPORE""Policy guidance highlighted it was premature to go easy on the inflation fight as the trajectory is beholden to fluid global commodity cycle, remnant passthrough pressures from high input costs and the recent rupee depreciation might lower the net beneficial impact of softer imported pressures.""""In our view, this necessitates the monetary policy committee to continue to incrementally tighten policy in the rest of FY23. Marking a departure from practice, the central bank also discussed the health of external balances, but maintained that the scale of rupee depreciation was much more contained than in regional peers and selected reserve currencies.""KUNAL KUNDU, INDIA ECONOMIST, SOCIETE GENERALE, BENGALURU""The RBI echoed our view that peaking of inflation is not necessarily followed by easing of price pressures to comfortable levels. Inflation this year is unlikely to drop below the RBI's upper comfort zone of 6% and, hence, the central bank raised the policy rate by 50 bps as was expected by us. Persistence of high inflation leads to entrenchment of expectation.""""The RBI rightly retained its inflation forecast for FY23 at 6.7%, while we are at 6.5%. We do expect inflation to drop below 6% from 2023 which is what the RBI expects too. We continue to believe that one more hike of 35 bps will bring to the current rate hike cycle to an end.""RUPA REGE NITSURE, GROUP CHIEF ECONOMIST, L&T FINANCIAL HOLDINGS, MUMBAI""The MPC's decision to raise the policy repo rate by 50 bps seems to be driven more by the latest tightening by global central banks, including yesterday's action by the Bank of England. As stated by the governor, India has witnessed FPI capital outflows to the tune of $13 billion in FY23 so far and the rupee has depreciated by 4.7% until yesterday. No doubt that this front-loading of interest rate hikes is facilitated by improved economic outlook and steady pickup in lending activities of banks and NBFCs.""SAKSHI GUPTA, PRINCIPAL ECONOMIST, HDFC BANK, GURUGRAM""The RBI continued to 'front-load' its rate hikes in line with our expectations. The central bank highlighted that while inflation might moderate in the coming months, uncertainty around these pressures continues to remain high, necessitating the need for a 50-bp rate hike. Expect the RBI to take the repo rate to 5.75% in this cycle.""""We expect liquidity surplus to average at 3 lakh crore rupees in Q2, supported by the RBI's fine-tuning of operations, an increase in government spending and a lower need for forex interventions given the recent rupee rally. Bond yields are likely to reverse some of their recent rally and we see 7.3-7.4% as a more sustainable level for the 10-year yield by quarter-end.""UPASNA BHARDWAJ, CHIEF ECONOMIST, KOTAK MAHINDRA BANK, MUMBAI""The MPC's decisions have been in line with our expectations. Given the increasing external sector imbalances and global uncertainties, the need for front-loaded action was imperative. We continue to see a 5.75% repo rate by December 2022.""GARIMA KAPOOR, ECONOMIST, INSTITUTIONAL EQUITIES, ELARA CAPITAL, MUMBAI""To rein in inflationary pressures and anchor inflation expectations, the MPC hiked the repo rate by 50 bps and retained its stance on withdrawal of accommodation.""""After today's policy, we expect a hike of another 25 bps and expect MPC to become data-dependent while it assesses the impact of recent hikes on inflation. Amid signs of a peak out of DXY and encouraged by the recent sharp correction in global commodity prices, we expect the rupee to remain supported in the rage of 79-80.5 even as high trade deficit prints remain a risk.""""As risks of a global slowdown get priced in, the 10-year yield is likely to oscillate in the range of 7.15 to 7.35... in tandem with movements in global yields.""Share article on",https://www.vccircle.com//rbihikes-repo-rate-for-third-consecutive-time,Finance,"The Reserve Bank of India's key policy repo rate was raised by 50 basis points on Friday, the third increase in as many months to cool stubbornly high inflation.With June retail inflation hitting 7%, economists polled by Reuters had expected another rate hike, but views were widely split between a 25-bp move or a 50-bp increase.The monetary policy committee (MPC) raised the key lending rate or the repo rate to 5.40%.The Standing Deposit Facility rate and the Marginal Standing Facility rate were accordingly adjusted higher by the same quantum to 5.15% and 5.65%, respectively.COMMENTARYPRITHVIRAJ SRINIVAS, CHIEF ECONOMIST, AXIS CAPITAL, MUMBAI""The central bank's action is largely along expected lines and will be seen as part of a series of steps to take the policy rate to neutral viz.","[""The Reserve Bank of India's"", 'Reuters', 'MPC', '5.40%.The Standing Deposit Facility', 'the Marginal Standing Facility', 'AXIS CAPITAL']",['$13 billion']

BharatPe hires former SBI Card executive as CFO,03 August,"Fintech unicorn BharatPe has appointed former SBI Card official Nalin Negi as its chief financial officer, in a bid to make the company operationally profitable by end of this fiscal.   Negi, who has over two decades' experience in the banking and financial services sector, will be also leading financial readiness for the company as it prepares for the public listing. Nalin will be reporting to chief executive officer at BharatPe, Suhail Sameer.  “His (Nalin) knowledge of banking and financial services will help us launch and scale fintech products that are future-ready and aligned to our mission of driving financial inclusion in the country. Also, Nalin’s experience of listing SBI Card will be instrumental for us as we aim to go public in FY25,” said Sameer.  Negi, a Delhi University alumnus, has earlier worked with largely reputed organizations such as GE Capital and SBI Card. In his latest stint, Nalin was the CFO of SBI Card (earlier known as GE Capital SBI Card) for over 10 years where he spearheaded a number of key strategic initiatives for the company including leading SBI Card’s IPO in March 2020. Prior to that, he was associated with American Express (India) Pvt Ltd, EXL Service (India) Pvt Ltd, Nestle India Ltd, and ITC Ltd.“BharatPe has been the flagbearer for digital payments in India and has also been at the forefront of solving the credit gap for SMEs and offline retailers in the country, having closed Q1 of FY23 with over Rs 3600 crore in total loans facilitated in the first quarter of FY23 and over $18 billion in annualized TPV in payments.  This is the second leadership announcement for BharatPe this year.

Koladiya was the company’s face and negotiated with investors for funding. Three months later, in June 2018, Grover joined as the third co-founder.  The company since the beginning of the year has come under significant investor and media scrutiny after a tussle between Grover and the company’s board over alleged misappropriation of funds by the former.

Uber likely to sell Zomato shares in block deal,02 August,"On a day when shares of Zomato Ltd jumped 20% to hit the upper circuit following its Q1 earnings, a large shareholder of the company has put up shares worth as much as $373 million on sale through a block deal, according to deal terms seen by Mint. American ride sharing company Uber is the likely seller of the Zomato shares, a person aware of the development said, speaking on the condition of anonymity.The shareholder, whose name was not disclosed in the deal terms, is selling 612 million shares representing 7.8% shareholding in Zomato in a price range of Rs48 – Rs54 per share, a 2.8% - 13.6% discount to Rs55.55 per share closing price of the stock on Tuesday, as per the deal terms. Shares will be sold to institutional investors. This will result in an overall deal size of Rs2,938 crore or $373 million. Bank of America is the sole broker on the block trade. An email sent to Uber did not elicit a response till press time.Uber B.V held 612.19 million shares in Zomato, representing 7.78% shareholding, as of 30 June, data from BSE shows. Uber is the second biggest single shareholder in Zomato after Info Edge. The block trade will result in a complete exit for Uber. Uber was allotted shares in Zomato following the latter’s acquisition of Uber Eats’ India business in January 2020, filings by Zomato show. The block trade comes after the 12-month lock-in for pre-IPO shareholders of Zomato ended on 23 July. On Tuesday, shares of Zomato hit the upper circuit for the first time since listing after it narrowed its losses in the first quarter of FY23. The share closed at the upper circuit of Rs 55.55, up 19.98% from its previous close, amid year high delivery and traded volumes of 19.67 crore shares and 53 crore shares respectively.The company posted a loss of Rs 186 crore in Q1 FY23, below the Rs 360 -odd crore loss reported sequentially and a year ago.

"Kotak's alternative asset arm floats Rs 1,500 cr fund to invest in other PEs, VCs",02 August,"Kotak Investment Advisors Limited (KIAL), on Tuesday announced the launch of its “Fund of Funds (FoF)” to invest in other private equity (PE), venture capital (VC) funds coupled with direct investments into companies.   The Kotak India Alternate Allocation Fund targets to raise a corpus of Rs 1,500 crore, including a greenshoe option of Rs 750 crore,” said a statement by KIAL, the alternative asset unit of Kotak Mahindra Group. The first close of the fund is likely by the end of September. With a minimum investment ranging between $5-15 million, the fund’s objective is to diversify across PE/VC funds in multiple sectors, including consumer, technology, healthcare, financials, etc, as well as across multiple stages – including early, growth and late-stage investments.  In June, VCCircle exclusively reported about Kotak group’s plans to enter this space.  Kotak India Alternate Allocation Fund is set up as an alternative investment fund (AIF) to be managed by KIAL, whose overall existing investments are spread across different asset classes including private equity funds, real estate funds, infrastructure funds, special situations fund, listed strategies and investment advisory.  A Fund of Fund is a pooled investment fund that collects money from investors and deploys it into other types of funds.  Kotak added that the Fund of Fund also intends to invest some portion into co-investment opportunities available from such investee funds.  “Through Kotak’s Fund of Funds we intend to provide investors access multiple funds as well as leverage our institutional diligence with peer benchmarking data available, coupled with institutional monitoring of long tenure funds…The performance difference between best and worst fund managers in PE/VC funds can be as high as 15- 20% IRR (internal rate of returns),” said Nidhi Chawla, Fund Manager, Kotak India Alternate Allocation Fund.  Diversification of risk across fund managers is tough due to high minimum investment requirements, Chawla added.  In May last year, markets regulator SEBI had eased investment norms allowing Indian Fund of Funds backing PE or VC funds to invest up to 25% of corpus in one portfolio company either directly or through another fund. The limit is applicable to Fund of Funds that fall under the Category I and Category II AIF regimes. Category I refers to social impact funds, venture capital funds and infrastructure funds, while Category II refers to private equity and private debt funds.Presently, India has Fund of Funds set up by National Investment and Infrastructure Fund (NIIF) and Small Industries Development Bank of India (SIDBI). In the Union Budget early this year, the finance minister also proposed setting up blended capital thematic funds in the 'sunrise' sectors of climate action, agriculture and deep technology sectors.“Indian alternate ecosystem has become vibrant with PE/VC fund managers delivering consistent returns and outperformance over public benchmarks. But many of the marquee fund managers have been inaccessible to domestic investors as they raised only offshore capital or had high minimum ticket investment requirements. With Kotak’s Fund of Funds, we intend to enable access to such funds and increase domestic overall participation in the Indian alternates industry,” said Srini Sriniwasan, managing director at KIAL said. Billionaire Uday Kotak-controlled Kotak Group’s alternative investment firm was set up in 2005 and is among the largest homegrown private investment firms in the country with total assets under management of $5.7 billion across all asset classes.  KIAL is also in the process of raising its second Strategic Situation fund with a corpus of $650-1 billion by October. In May, it had announced plans to launch a Rs 1,000-crore private credit fund. Share article on",https://www.vccircle.com//kotaks-alternative-asset-arm-floats-rs-1-500-cr-fund-to-invest-in-other-pes-vcs,Finance,"“Through Kotak’s Fund of Funds we intend to provide investors access multiple funds as well as leverage our institutional diligence with peer benchmarking data available, coupled with institutional monitoring of long tenure funds…The performance difference between best and worst fund managers in PE/VC funds can be as high as 15- 20% IRR (internal rate of returns),” said Nidhi Chawla, Fund Manager, Kotak India Alternate Allocation Fund.Category I refers to social impact funds, venture capital funds and infrastructure funds, while Category II refers to private equity and private debt funds.Presently, India has Fund of Funds set up by National Investment and Infrastructure Fund (NIIF) and Small Industries Development Bank of India (SIDBI).","['IRR', 'Kotak India Alternate Allocation Fund', 'National Investment and Infrastructure Fund', 'Small Industries Development Bank of India', 'SIDBI']","['between $5-15 million', '$5.7 billion', '$650-1 billion']"

Zomato shares sharply higher after net loss halves in Q1,02 August,"Shares of online food delivery aggregator Zomato rallied nearly 8% on the BSE to ₹49 apiece in Tuesday's opening deals as its consolidated net loss in the first quarter of the current financial year almost halved to ₹186 crore due to higher other income.

This was driven by a 10% sequential jump in its gross order value (GOV) to ₹6,430 crore in Q1FY23, which was led by order volumes and a mild growth in average order values.“In our recent note, we highlighted the management focus on path to profitability. 1QFY23 results now suggest that we underestimated the urgency, as adj.

Oil rises for 2nd day after Gazprom says will curb supply to Europe,26 July,"Oil prices rose on Tuesday for a second day on increasing concerns about tightening European supply after Russia, a key oil and natural gas supplier to the region, cut gas supply through a major pipeline.Brent crude futures for September settlement rose $1.51, or 1.4%, to $106.66 a barrel by 0339 GMT, extending a 1.9% gain in the previous day.US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures for September delivery increased $1.36, or 1.4%, to $98.04 a barrel, having gained 2.1% on Monday.Russia tightened its gas squeeze on Europe on Monday as Gazprom said supplies through the Nord Stream 1 pipeline to Germany would drop to just 20% of capacity.Russia's cut in supplies will leave countries unable to meet its goals to refill natural gas storage ahead of the winter demand period. Germany, Europe's biggest economy, faces potentially rationing gas to industry to keep its citizens warm during the winter months.This could prompt end-users to swap their gas for oil products, particularly diesel. But this also carries risks since Russia supplies most of the region's diesel fuel and prices for drivers who depend on the fuel are expected to rise.""Higher gas prices, triggered by Russia's gas squeeze, could lead to additional switching to crude from gas and support oil prices,"" said Hiroyuki Kikukawa, general manager of research at Nissan Securities.Europe's crude, oil product and gas supplies have been disrupted by a combination of Western sanctions and payment disputes with Russia since its 24 February invasion of Ukraine, which Moscow calls a ""special military operation.""Still, falling demand because of recent high crude and fuel prices and the expectation of an increase in interest rates in the United States have put pressure on prices.""A tug-of-war between concerns about weakening demand due to the economic slowdown amid rising U.S. interest rates and fears of supply risk because of prolonged Russia-Ukraine conflict will likely to continue for some time,"" Kikukawa said, predicting WTI to trade in a range around $100 a barrel.The US central bank is widely expected to raise interest rates by 75 basis points at the conclusion of its policy meeting on Wednesday.

CPPIB now eligible for income tax relief for investment in India,22 July,"The Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) on Friday notified pension fund CPPIB Credit Investments VI Inc., as an eligible entity for income tax relief for investments made in India by end of March 2024, showed an official order.  The tax break is subject to riders - the entity has to file a tax return from the time of its investment till it is liquidated as prescribed under Income Tax Act. It also has to report quarterly investments made in India to the tax department.  The tax relief seeks to attract foreign investors into India’s infrastructure sector. CPPIB Credit Investments VI Inc. is one of several pension funds that have already received this benefit.  This tax incentive was introduced in the Income Tax Act by way of Finance Act 2020 and is in effect from 1 April, 2021. The relief is given under Section 10 of the Income Tax Act which deals with earnings not to be included in the taxable income.  It covers income of the notified person in the nature of dividend, interest or long-term capital gains arising from an investment in India, whether in the form of debt or share capital.  The rising number of investors opting for this tax break indicates the growing appetite among sovereign wealth funds and pension funds for India’s infrastructure sector at a time the government is betting on its multiplier effect to support economic growth.  The government’s pipeline of about 7,000 identified infrastructure projects has a total cost of about Rs 111 trillion. The risks involved in long gestation infrastructure projects means normal bank lending is not enough to finance these projects. Pension funds and sovereign wealth funds help to fill this gap in financing projects. Share article on",https://www.vccircle.com//cppib-now-eligible-for-income-tax-relief-for-investment-in-india,Finance,The tax break is subject to riders - the entity has to file a tax return from the time of its investment till it is liquidated as prescribed under Income Tax Act.The rising number of investors opting for this tax break indicates the growing appetite among sovereign wealth funds and pension funds for India’s infrastructure sector at a time the government is betting on its multiplier effect to support economic growth.,[],[]
"Digital lenders should stick to businesses they are licensed to do, says RBI Governor Das",22 July,"Digital lenders should operate within the guardrails of regulatory guidelines and adhere to the specific licences granted to them, Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Shaktikanta Das said on Friday.“The firms should operate under the licenses granted to them. If they are doing anything beyond that then they should seek our permission. Without permission if they are engaging in activities for which they have no license then it is not acceptable,” Das said at Bank of Baroda’s annual banking conference.Das said that RBI cannot allow risk to be built up in the system and added that within the next few weeks, it will release the much-awaited digital lending norms. According to Das, the central bank wants to support innovation and, at the same time, wants the entire ecosystem to grow in an orderly and regulated manner. The regulations has been delayed because of the complexity of the situation. The regulator has to support innovation, while maintaining financial stability, he said.“...we are dealing with the large number of unregulated, unlicensed entities which are doing various kinds of lending. There are licensed entities also which are entering into activities which they are not supposed to undertake,” he said.The regulator, Das said, has formed a committee, whose recommendations have been examined. “Our responsibility is to maintain financial stability. The firms should operate under the licenses granted to them. If they are doing anything beyond that then they should seek our permission. Without permission if they are engaging in activities for which they have no license then it is not acceptable,” he said.In November last year, the committee set up by the central bank suggested reining in digital loan apps through a mix of regulations, including setting up of a nodal agency to verify their credentials and legislative measures to prevent “illegal lending”. The thrust of the report was on enhancing customer protection and making the digital lending ecosystem safe while encouraging innovation.RBI had constituted a Working Group (WG) on digital lending including lending through online platforms and mobile apps headed by its executive director Jayant Kumar Dash. As per the findings of the committee, there were approximately 1,100 lending apps available for Indian Android users across over 80 application stores between 1 January and 28 February. Of these, 600 are illegal, the panel found.Share article on",https://www.vccircle.com//digital-lenders-should-stick-to-businesses-they-are-licensed-to-do-says-rbi-governor-das,Finance,"Digital lenders should operate within the guardrails of regulatory guidelines and adhere to the specific licences granted to them, Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Shaktikanta Das said on Friday.“The firms should operate under the licenses granted to them.Without permission if they are engaging in activities for which they have no license then it is not acceptable,” Das said at Bank of Baroda’s annual banking conference.Das said that RBI cannot allow risk to be built up in the system and added that within the next few weeks, it will release the much-awaited digital lending norms.","['Digital', 'Reserve Bank of India', 'RBI', 'Das', 'Bank of Baroda’s', 'Das', 'RBI']",[]

Further, the banks are exercising their statutory rights in accordance with law as they are not party to the arbitration proceedings,” said the NCLT in its order.Amazon is expected to challenge the order in the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT). With the admission of FRL into insolvency, a moratorium kicks-in till the resolution of insolvency; meaning any other enforcement or legal proceedings are paused. “This Bench hereby prohibits the institution of suits or continuation of pending suits or proceedings against the corporate debtor including execution of any judgment, decree or order in any court of law, tribunal, arbitration panel or other authority, transferring, encumbering, alienating or disposing of by the corporate debtor any of its assets or any legal right or beneficial interest,” said NCLT in the order. “Proceedings initiated by Amazon against FRL before SIAC (Singapore International Arbitration Centre) also ought to be stayed otherwise any award passed by SIAC may be in conflict with the Indian law,"" said Sandeep Bajaj , Managing Partner PSL Advocates and Solicitors.Bajaj also added that after this order, and if the same is not interfered with by the NCLAT, the financial creditors will now form the committee of creditors and drive the entire CIR Process. According to Tarun Agarwal, co-Founder & head of a Jaipur-based law firm TBA Legal, the remedy available with Amazon is to challenge the rejection of its intervention application by the NCLT before the NCLAT under section 65 of IBC. Section 65 deals with the provisions relating to the penalty for fraudulent or malicious initiation of proceedings. The adjudicating authority can impose a penalty. “It is also noteworthy that since the moratorium imposed under Section 14 of the IBC does not have an extra-territorial jurisdiction, any foreign seated arbitration against FRL may continue. However, the limitation under current legal framework is that any award passed in such an arbitration proceeding will not be enforceable against FRL by Indian courts,"" said Agarwal. Future Retail owes its creditors led by Bank of India more than Rs 15,000 crore, which led the bankers to drag the company to the bankruptcy court. Bank of India’s dues amount to Rs 856.10 crore. The Bank of India, on 14 April, initiated insolvency against Future Group for non-payment of dues that were due under the terms of the Framework Agreement entered into between the company and the bank.Amazon in its plea had alleged collusion by lenders however the NCLT dismissed the allegations as ‘baseless’. “Allegation of collusion of the Lenders with Corporate Debtor and MDA (Mukesh Dhirubhai Ambani) group seems to be baseless, since, at the time of voting by the secured creditors, the financial creditor and the other lenders had opposed the scheme of arrangement, same has been admitted by the intervenor himself. The onus to prove the existence of fraud is on the party alleging the same and in the present case, the applicant had miserably failed to establish the same,” said NCLT.Share article on",https://www.vccircle.com//nclt-admits-petition-to-initiate-resolution-against-future-retail,Finance,"The Bank of India, on 14 April, initiated insolvency against Future Group for non-payment of dues that were due under the terms of the Framework Agreement entered into between the company and the bank.Amazon in its plea had alleged collusion by lenders however the NCLT dismissed the allegations as ‘baseless’.“Allegation of collusion of the Lenders with Corporate Debtor and MDA (Mukesh Dhirubhai Ambani) group seems to be baseless, since, at the time of voting by the secured creditors, the financial creditor and the other lenders had opposed the scheme of arrangement, same has been admitted by the intervenor himself.","['The Bank of India', 'Future Group', 'the Framework Agreement', 'Amazon', 'NCLT', 'MDA']",[]

PNB Housing settles Carlyle open offer case with regulator,20 July,"PNB Housing Finance Ltd and 11 directors of the company have settled the Carlyle Group open offer case with the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) without admission of guilt.The market regulator had in June 2021 initiated proceedings against the mortgage lender for alleged failure to obtain a valuation report for a preferential sale of its shares to buyout firm Carlyle Group.Sebi’s high powered advisory committee had in May recommended settlement of the case upon payment of ₹72 lakh, including ₹44 lakh as legal costs. PNB Housing Finance, along with 11 directors, on 15 June settled the case related to the proposed open offer after jointly paying the money to Sebi. Under the mortgage lender’s proposed ₹4,000 crore deal with Carlyle Group, PNB Housing Finance was to make a preferential issue to investors, led by the private equity firm, at ₹390 per share.The deal came under scrutiny after a proxy advisory firm, Stakeholders Empowerment Services, said that the proposed investment went against the interest of the shareholders of PNB Housing Finance and Punjab National Bank. The deal was struck at a valuation less than the book value and the shares were not valued by an independent agency.Sebi said the shares were undervalued and an independent valuation must be undertaken before the allotment is put to the vote. It then stopped the EGM which was to consider the issue of shares.The mortgage lender moved the Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT) on whether Sebi has the jurisdiction to restrain it from holding the meeting. SAT gave a split verdict in the matter in August last year, following which Sebi approached the Supreme Court.On 16 October 2021, PNB Housing Finance informed Sebi through an email that it had informed the stock exchanges on 14 October 2021 that its board had chosen not to move forward with the preferential issue. The top court issued an order on 20 October 2021 declaring the appeal as infructuous and dismissing it.Share article on",https://www.vccircle.com//pnb-housing-settles-carlyle-open-offer-case-with-regulator,Finance,"PNB Housing Finance Ltd and 11 directors of the company have settled the Carlyle Group open offer case with the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) without admission of guilt.The market regulator had in June 2021 initiated proceedings against the mortgage lender for alleged failure to obtain a valuation report for a preferential sale of its shares to buyout firm Carlyle Group.Sebi’s high powered advisory committee had in May recommended settlement of the case upon payment of ₹72 lakh, including ₹44 lakh as legal costs.Under the mortgage lender’s proposed ₹4,000 crore deal with Carlyle Group, PNB Housing Finance was to make a preferential issue to investors, led by the private equity firm, at ₹390 per share.The deal came under scrutiny after a proxy advisory firm, Stakeholders Empowerment Services, said that the proposed investment went against the interest of the shareholders of PNB Housing Finance and Punjab National Bank.","['PNB Housing Finance Ltd', 'the Carlyle Group', 'the Securities and Exchange Board of India', 'Carlyle Group', '₹', 'Carlyle Group', 'PNB Housing Finance', 'Stakeholders Empowerment Services', 'PNB Housing Finance', 'Punjab National Bank']","['72', '4,000', '390']"
